Sep 2019,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian.

Jul 2019,"The only unenjoyable thing about doing Water Sports in Nusa Dua is negotiating the prices with the operators. There are dozens of companies lined up along the beach, one after the other, all after your business. They vast majority of them will charge you as much as they can and make the whole process very confusing. The 1st thing you need to do is research your prices. We found some great prices on the Wira Water website and we used them as a negotiating tool. The prices are less than half of what operators will try and charge you. The 2nd thing you need to know is that if you let your taxi or shuttle driver enter the car park of any business, they will get a 5% cut of whatever you spend. Tell them to park outside and send someone off to talk to the various operators until they find the right one. There were 9 people in our group. We negotiated the internet prices with a further 10% off the prices found on the internet and no additional credit card fees (usually an extra 4%). The whole group had a 15 minute jet ski, tandem parasail, banana boat and four people did the flying fish. In total Cost was 2,500,000 IDR or around $250AUD. Very reasonable! Also the operators were happy because we didn’t book it through the internet agency and therefore cut out an extra middle man. Last time we were in Bali we all wanted to go parasailing and booked through an agency in Seminyak. When we arrived at Nusa Dua they told us that it was too windy and they weren’t doing parasailing.

Jan 2019,"I entered the beach area from a pedestrian walkway from the scooter park at the Bay Bali.    When assessing the Nusa Dua beach I am Referring to the public beach at the entry points where most people seem to stay in this area (and are supposed to stay?).  I am rating the public beach sections. To your left as you come out is the more northerly section to the left, strictly speaking this is Nusa Dua beach.  It is a sand and rock beach bounded by massive, and I mean massive, walls of sandbags to protect the coast.  There is another section to your right that is more attractive and the start of the longer southerly section, which has other named beach sections.  At this end it’s ok but the ubiquitous plastic seems to gravitate to this end, so walk further south.  If you look at some maps the whole beach for the next 4km is labelled Nusa Dua beach, however a succession of hotels adopt each section of beach. So although you are not discouraged or checked you get the feeling most locals don’t penetrate to the far end of the beach which took about a 45 minutes stroll. At the end there is a long curving jetty looking up to the Monastery which is not accessible from the beach.  It gets cleaner and here are less people the further you walk up the beach. Overall a nice beach but I wouldn’t travel from Seminak again to go there, although I would say that it looks cleaner water. I also think it’s much cleaner than the beaches going up further north on the Nusa Dua peninsula which gets nearer and nearer to the port traffic and all the pollutants that go with ports.

Non residents were invited to use the beach and amenities, couches etc, however, were restricted to the beach and could not use the pools etc in the hotel grounds.In some areas, most of which are roped off to prevent you going too far off shore for your safety, reefs were evident, and many people were snorkeling off the beach. The water was calm and clear and great for children.Warning signs are everywhere, telling people that they swim at their own risk as lifeguards are not present and jellyfish are an issue at certain times during the year, although we went snorkeling and did not see any. (We traveled in October). A few local people sell their wares along the beaches, however, they are pleasant and happy just to wish you good morning if you do not want to purchase their goods.

You need to get up early if you want sun-beds that are in the shade, as people reserve them with hotel beach towels. In common with many tropical beaches, the water near the beach is a shallow lagoon, formed by the reef which is a bit further out. There is a line of buoys which separate the swimming area from the area used by small boats (some of them fast-moving), so you're not supposed to swim out to the reef. You can have a good swim only around high tide, as it's too shallow at other times. There are some beach-hawkers but they are polite and not persistent and their merchandise seems pretty good.",review specific front nusa dua hotel spa nice picturesque sandy quite lot shade available due palm tree need early want sunbeds shade people reserve hotel towel common many tropical beach water near shallow lagoon form reef bit line buoy separate swim area area use small boat fastmoving youre suppose swim reef good swim around high tide shallow time beachhawkers polite persistent merchandise seem pretty good,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.21, 'compound': 0.9287}",0.9287,positive

Sep 2018,"The stay at Nusa Dua beach came at the end of a three week trip around South East Asia so was always meant to be a relaxed part of the holiday which it was. The restaurants at the hotel are lovely and there is a reasonable selection of foods. A highlight for us was the breakfast. We would normally head out of the hotel and look for something local. Due to the location of the hotel that would have been impractical so we had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. Although the setting is very similar to other resorts we have stayed in around the world there are a number of touches that make it distinctively Balinese. A down side to the resort is that it is in an area full of gated resorts and nothing around that you can wander out and look at so you feel that you’re tied to the resort unless you want a trip out by taxi . There is a free shuttle to a shopping centre called Bali Collection but it feels like walking round a retail outlet at home. We found it good for buying any toiletries or water that you may need. All in all the resort served a purpose for us. We booked it for relaxation at the end of a trip. The staff were superb and as we found in Bali, the most polite friendliest people I’ve ever met but if you want real Bali you would have to travel out or stay somewhere off the man made track.

Feb 2016," I checked in at the Mulias on the 11th Feb for a 3 nights stay. I booked through Leading Hotels of the World (LHW). The day I was to check in I sent an email to the hotel requesting a smoking room. I was confused to be informed that, by Indonesian law, no smoking was allowed on the property of any hotel (I have been staying in several hotel and resort properties both in Jakarta and Bali which all offered abundant accommodations for smokers in all outdoor areas, including private balcony's and terraces.). Additionally, no mention of their property being smoke-free was listed on their LHW page at the time of my bookingFurthermore, the duty manager, Mr. Falimra Kalmi, advised me that their resort was the only 6 star property in Indonesia, regardless of the fact that no hotel can be awarded more than five stars.   This '6 star' property was mostly decorated with obviously artificial flowers both in the room as well as public spaces.  Everywhere I turned there was signage warning guests of which activities were forbidden. While it's common hotel courtesy to be excused from a contract if an arriving guest does not find the property to be of his expectations, the duty manager absolutely refused to give any type of refund at all whatsoever. By the second day my loathing of this property made it impossible to stay anylonger, so I cut my losses and left.",check mulias 11th feb 3 night stay book leading hotel world lhw day check sent email hotel request smoking room confuse informed indonesian law smoking allow property hotel stay several hotel resort property jakarta bali offer abundant accommodation smoker outdoor area include private balcony terrace additionally mention property smokefree list lhw page time bookingfurthermore duty manager mr falimra kalmi advise resort 6 star property indonesia regardless fact hotel award five star 6 star property mostly decorate obviously artificial flower room well public space everywhere turn signage warning guest activity forbidden common hotel courtesy excuse contract arrive guest find property expectation duty manager absolutely refuse give type refund whatsoever second day loathe property make impossible stay anylonger cut loss leave,"{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.776, 'pos': 0.085, 'compound': -0.7264}",-0.7264,negative

Feb 2016,"This beach is quite nice stretch of white sand, that is relatively clean and maintained, especially if you walk around the bigger and luxurious hotels. A promenade lines the shore , passing hotels of mainly 4-5* rating, allowing you to see the gardens, pools and the architecture of each hotel. This promenade, especially heading south of hotel Bali Tropic offers nice walks, good jogs or bike rides. Heading north of the hotel, after about 1,5km, you will pass through few dirty and unkept areas, which ruins the walk. There are a few downsides of this otherwise lovely beach-Firstly it is the constant noise of water scooters and fast boats, that spoil the tranquility of this place. We visited in February '16 and the hotels and beaches were quite empty, which suited us. However I can imagine this place getting very busy and even noisier in the peak periods and turning this lovely area into sea of bodies fighting for the beach and sun lounger. The second downside is the difference in tide of these shallow waters . In high tide, the swimming areas (you can only swim in small sections marked by the buoys) is ok but never too deep, which makes is ideal for small children. Also the currents are very weak, making the beach quite safe for non swimmers. During the low tide, in many places you can barely swim- the water level is up to the waistline. Also in low tide you often swim through the algae, which is not pleasant at all. The hotels are trying to clean the beach of plastic, algae and other debris, but sometimes their efforts are not enough. In general, it is a lovely stretch of beach worth visiting and perhaps staying in one of many luxury hotels.

However, the currents are quite strong and you need to be careful with weak swimmers or children. There are also far far fewer interruptions from sellers than some of the others like Kuta/Seminyak.The first time we visited we paid 200,000 for two sunbeds with an umbrella in a hotel complexes private area. As a result we had no interruptions and were able to go to the hotel for lunch and a swim in the pool if we wanted. To be honest, I think we could have maybe bargained them down but we didn't bother.The second time we paid 50,000 for two in a different area of Nusa Dua and this was on the public beach.

Here, the cost also is quite expensive but after a long negotiation session, we were so lucky to get only IDR 1,000,000 for 2! It's a local rate! My advice for those who wants to do the water sports activities, please book in advance via online booking, much cheaper compared to walk in price. Unless you are lucky like us, you will get a good bargain :). Another thing, please bring along your gopro to capture underwater moments or else you have to pay another IDR 1,000,000 for  them to capture your pictures and videos.",flight ticket bali confirm first activity cross mind sea walk dont swim dont dive suitable activity discover underwater world lol say gamble visit nusa dua without book water sport activity arrive 1030 walk one water sport activity agent dont remember whats agency name surprise cost sea walk usd120 per head leave agency go another agency watermark cost quite expensive long negotiation session lucky idr 1000000 2 local rate advice want water sport activity please book advance via online book much cheap compare walk price unless lucky u will good bargain another thing please bring along gopro capture underwater moment pay another idr 1000000 capture picture videos,"{'neg': 0.022, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.181, 'compound': 0.9477}",0.9477,positive

Oct 2014,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore. It was the third time to Bali, so we wanted to stay at a clean and quiet beach, with no vendor bothering us, and where kids could swim in the sea. Purpose was just to relax.We found all this in Nusa Dua, although the area is secluded and the beach could be anywhere on the globe, as there is no specific Balinese taste when you are on this beach. But we knew it and just wanted to experience this for 5 days, not far from home.The sand was clean and blond as well, very nice. We could swim in the lagoon where the water was clear and pristine. There is a promenade along the beach, connecting all the hotels on this beach, most of them of high-end to luxury. The architectural design of most hotels fits well with the nature (wood/local style). The hotel buildings are also usually set back from the beach. So the natural seafront landscapte is relatively more preserved than on other sanur or kuta beaches.Of note, in South Bali, we find most beaches crowed, dirty and full of vendors that are very anoying sometimes. Some may say the vendors are part of the local experience. Agree but when it disturbs you, it is not pleasant at all. As for Nusa Dua beach, only 2 accredited vendors per hotel are allowed to sell stuff on the beach to guests and most of them are very polite and relatively discret.",french family currently live singapore third time bali want stay clean quiet vendor bother u kid swim sea purpose relaxwe find nusa dua although area seclude anywhere globe specific balinese taste know wanted experience 5 day far homethe sand clean blond well nice swim lagoon water clear pristine promenade along connect hotel highend luxury architectural design hotel fit well nature woodlocal style hotel building usually set back natural seafront landscapte relatively preserve sanur kuta beachesof note south bali find beach crow dirty full vendor anoying sometimes may say vendor part local experience agree disturbs pleasant nusa dua 2 accredited vendor per hotel allow sell stuff guest polite relatively discret,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.71, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9501}",0.9501,positive

In October, the beach comes alive for a week with all the local villagers arriving at the temple grounds to celebrate Diwali a hindu festival, the temple grounds are alive with culture culmanating in two or three colourful and musical nights of religious celebrations.

The beach fr me was in a lot better condition than Padang Padang or Dreamland for that matter, This coming from a cleanliness position. great for swimming. If you do feel like getting out to Kuta for some shopping or experiencing the tourist hustle and bustle a cab ride will cost about 20 USD one way. There is an open air mall called Bali collection and most resorts provide free transport but i must warn you that this over priced but has some decent resturants worth trying out. Dont use the massage services theres cause hey a little expensive. If you venture out of the gates you will find a little street shopping area where you can find great bargins and try out Zahras SPA for some RR.

No opportunity to do any snorkelling. - There were jellyfishes spotted - watch out or you may be stung by one!- There was somewhat watersport activities but at expensive prices offered by ad-hoc vendors sitting by the beach. My husband enquired for jetski and he was quoted USD$55 for 30 minutes - not sure if this is the normal rate but it seemed quite pricey so we did not go ahead. - We saw a couple renting a kayak and they went kayaking but there seemed to be no regulations whatsoever. The couple were not wearing any life vests which is very dangerous. In addition, we later spotted them kayaking way past the lifebuoys and they appeared to be kayaking on the same spot as the current was very, very strong.

It was a gamble on our part because it was our last day at Bali, if something goes wrong, there will be no way and no chance for a double take.  We started the photo shoot in the hotel property and the final setting was the (Nusa Dua) beach.  We posed, walked, ran, jumped, played role and some candid shots at the beach.  Our pants/shorts got wet by the waves but it turned out to be the highlight of the session.  The 6 pm scheduled preview was fun but overwhelming because we had to choose from the 354 shots taken.  Our preliminary number was 81 photos.  We were going to review the 81 photos to reduce it some more but then the male staff interrupted and offered us a deal....the first deal was not good enough and we refused....he sweetened the deal a bit more and we went off tip toeing our way to the restaurant for a special dinner.

At the end of the road, there is beach area for us to relax whilst waiting for our wives to finish their massage. Walking along the beach, I realised that despite all the beach chairs and facilities by the hotels, the beach is actually quite dirty. Seen load of rubbish floating along the waves onto the beach. There was a bar somewhere nearby and we had our Bintang Beer at 35,000 ruppiah per glass. Can't complain on the hotel pricing. The next day, we were taken to another side of Nusa Dua where we wanted to do the Sea Walker but on arrival was told that per pax cost us USD108. I understood from the internet it cost around USD55 so there was no way we were going for it. Instead, snorkeling cost only USD25 so in order to satisfy the boys, we agreed to take up snorkeling. We were taken to a boat which took us out further to sea. On the way, it was a long sad sight to see. Rubbish on the beach and floating on the sea. Dead sea corals underneath! Not so clear waters. Is this the Great Bali Beach we came for? When we jumped out of the boat for snorkeling, the waves were incredibly strong even for an adult, and the tide keep taking us away from the boat. I had to swim afloat just to keep an eye on the boys from straying away. The snorkeling activity was for an hour but after 20 mins, we all decided we had enough and jumped onto the boat. Surprisingly, there is no ladder and not easy climbing up by stepping on the motor engine. Along the way back, plenty of sea activity... jet skies, banana boat etc. How long will this beach last until the sea becomes undesirable one day?

There were a few others there in the cove who had also discovered this secret location, but I'm sad to say that once the monolith of a resort next door is completed, I don't think that beach (or the Beach Grill) will be the same the next time we visit.

You can also do a bit of shopping at the stalls along the beach.  Was lovely to see how many Weddings took place.

Feb 2011,"The beach in Nusa Dua is not that much fun if you are not in one of the many big resorts. The complete promenade is filled with long stretching expensive looking resorts, which own all the sunbeds. Yes, the beach is quite clean, has great yellow sand and the waters are clear and clean, but there is no atmosphere around this beach. We tried to relax between the two peninsulas, but over there you are only allowed to stay at a small lane, because the rest is owned by another resort. It is funny to drive around in Nusa Dua, because it is totally different compared to the rest of Bali. It is a secured village, all set-up for expensive tourism, with beautiful gardens etc. but it really misses a soul and you feel that during your stay on the beach. As long as you are not a rich person who enjoys all this drive only through Nusa Dua so you have seen it and than go to Pantai Geger (Geger Beach), which is on the side of Nusa Dua. That beach has a soul and great atmosphere.",nusa dua much fun one many big resort complete promenade fill long stretch expensive look resort sunbeds yes quite clean great yellow sand water clear clean atmosphere around try relax two peninsula allow stay small rest own another resort funny drive around nusa dua totally different compare rest bali secure village expensive tourism beautiful garden etc really miss soul feel stay long rich person enjoy drive nusa dua see go pantai geger geger side nusa dua soul great atmosphere,"{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.582, 'pos': 0.401, 'compound': 0.9913}",0.9913,positive
