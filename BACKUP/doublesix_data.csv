Stefan O,"Malmö, Sweden",Mar 2020,Double Six Beach is a great Beach for all surfers out there to enjoy those Big Waves each and Evert dag!
590biscuit,"Bolton, UK",Mar 2020,"Was disappointed by this beach, dirty, full of cigarette ends etc. Not a sitting beach as sea too rough.Some nice barsthough and a good vibe"
leanneandtony,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2020,Wide sandy beach which has a surf patrol.The beach is cleaned on a daily basis. Sun lounges and umbrellas are available for hire. Usually about 100000rup for two for the day. Also drinks can be purchased.There is surf. Some days there is a huge amount of plastic waste floating around in the water.For Bali in a tourist area it is a reasonable beach.
Kev,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Aug 2019,"Very nice beach to take a stroll. Although you get HOUNDED by people trying to sell you things. You don't get left alone for too long, which gets annoying. "
Lilly H,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2020,"We love Double Six Beach and although we usually stay at a villa nearby we try to go there and maybe have a swim at least once during our stay.There are so many bars and restaurants you can choose from,some with live music and lots of atmosphere "
Adrian B,"Brighton, UK",Feb 2020,"Some nice bars along this beach but the amount of litter washed up was very disappointing, it is an OK beach but it isn't going to wow you "
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2020 • Couples,This beach was very close to our hotel and we used lots. It is a really busy place with lots to see and do and there is something for everyone.You can rent sun loungers on there for not too much money and there’s lots of places to get food or drink. It is very close to the main road so there are tons of shops and food outlets.Watersports feature prominently and there are many people who will teach you how to surf if you require it. The sea can get very rough so best to do it with professional help.
Kristian B,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Feb 2020 • Family,"Cool clean beach with great waves for surfing but the beach also offer good opportunities for long walks, loads of food and drinks in beach beanbags."
Peter R,"Liverpool, UK",Dec 2019,"Good beach, nice and clean,  good surf if you like that sort of thing.  I walked from Double Six down to Kuta beach and then returned north to Seminyak beach. A lovely afternoon barefoot walk."
Sogwan,2 contributions,Jan 2020,"The beach is clean and we were well settled in sunbeds. we can buy juice, water.... and fruits, coconutThere is the Sunday in the restaurant a brunch very good "
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Sep 2019,"Were there last year, and really was not impressed with the beach itself, it seemed scraggy and dirty and were some dogs Doo doo really didn’t want to do more than a paddle, this year I still felt slightly uncomfortable walking through so we decided to carry on walking up the beach and we found some proper bars and seats and it felt as if we had gone to another part of the island, it was so clean and tidy and we could sit down on bean bags and we ended up going there the rest of the 10 days to the spot on the beach and I really started enjoying it and felt a lot better and continued to go into the Chiringuito Restaurant & Bar – Highly recommended and definitely going back again- Thank you"
Maureen M,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,Fine groomed sand and lovely warm waters. Take the locals knowledge on board on deciding best time of day to go surfing.  They are accurate within an hour.  Look out for rips and undertows which are endorsed by red flags alond beach.  It is otherwise a very nice safe beach.Plenty of cafes and surf board hire places along the beach. We paid 50000IDR (about 5 AUD) per hour for surfboard hire. Reallly good sate sticks cooked over coal   at Capil Cafe.Plenty of shopping opportunities in and around Double six beach.
Jean1823,"Nagoya, Japan",Oct 2019 • Friends,"great view of the sunset.. many vendors too, even at the bar they will approach you ;( but not as congested as Kuta. We walked by the beach from Kuta, and from Kuta beach to Double Six Beach the waves are nonstop so it’s good for surfing but not swimming."
Kate N,"Largs Bay, Australia",Oct 2019 • Family,Get down and see Carlos for a beach chair. Gorgeous beach. Lots of fun in the surf. Watch out for the rips. Make sure you swim between the flags. Gorgeous sunset. K-Resto has good meals. 
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2019 • Solo,"Great spot to view the sunset. Clean and not too crowded. Plenty of space to move around, or too place ball. Family friendly. "
BJM,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019 • Family,Well it is still not as clean as it could be...but much much better than it has been...we all need to help keep any beach clean and enjoyable for all. The surf school was a good place for the kids to have a go at surfing...the instructors were quite patient...it was a fun time
Malferg,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,"It's a nice, clean and not overcrowded beach. It's quite wide and dotted with umbrella's and lounges for rent and lots of Beach Clubs and Bars . There are a heaps of Traders flogging their wares. If you're like me and dont go to Kuta this is the place to watch the sunset."
Ellenia R,"Bandung, Indonesia",Oct 2019 • Solo,I came to this beach for watch the sunset and the view it's really amazing. I can't describe with words but it really beautiful
Louise H,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2019 • Family,"Spent the day here, beautiful resort and staff very friendly. Loved the restaurant,  fresh and delicious food. Highly recommend!"
myers9720,"Oceanside, CA",Sep 2019,My husband and I really enjoyed this beach. It’s very reasonable to rent lounge chairs and an umbrella. They give surf lessons here and it’s fun to watch everyone. Lots  of restaurants on the beach with okay food. The beach is very clean.
