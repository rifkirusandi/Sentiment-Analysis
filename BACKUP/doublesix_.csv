ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"One of the most popular beaches in Bali, Double Six Beach attracts crowds of tourists from nearby Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. The waves are mild here - perfect for first time surfers. Plenty of sunchairs to sit on, umbrellas to sit under, and coolers full of beers to sip."
AbramVincentM,"Mottram in Longdendale, UK",Mar 2020,We got amazing sunset here. Nearby double six beach there are plenty of great restaurants. Nice place for swim also.
Eve The Disabled Diva,"Chicago, IL",Aug 2020 • Couples,Great low key beach to surf or watch the sunset. Many beach bars and local small restaurants available. Beware of the sliding costs on loungers or bean bags. Water isn’t turquoise blue but still beautiful
Chelsea B,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2019,The beach was quite busy and as a consequence you'll find lots of people touting things from sunglasses to boat tours but the beach itself was nice and cleaner than some we'd come across.
Finds_posts,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"a very touristy place. lots of restaurants, gift shops and the water isn't that really clear like in Maldives or Ibiza. foods are very cheap in here"
Wendy F,"Western Australia, Australia",Mar 2020,"Very quiet beach not many touts and massage girls. close shops, bars and restuarants. Long walk to water wear shoes sand very hot"
Udita,3 contributions,May 2019 • Family,Cleaner than seminayk or kuta beach .There are other better beaches in bali than this. Good beach clubs to enjoy closeby like cucoon beach club
Marjut0303,"Vantaa, Finland",Nov 2019 • Friends,"Nice double six beach in Seminyak Bali, worth visiting! Also comfortable sun beds on the beach and the sunsets are amazing colourful! There are some cosy restaurants where to eat; food was excellent!"

Stefan O,"Malmö, Sweden",Mar 2020,Double Six Beach is a great Beach for all surfers out there to enjoy those Big Waves each and Evert dag!
590biscuit,"Bolton, UK",Mar 2020,"Was disappointed by this beach, dirty, full of cigarette ends etc. Not a sitting beach as sea too rough.Some nice barsthough and a good vibe"
leanneandtony,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2020,Wide sandy beach which has a surf patrol.The beach is cleaned on a daily basis. Sun lounges and umbrellas are available for hire. Usually about 100000rup for two for the day. Also drinks can be purchased.There is surf. Some days there is a huge amount of plastic waste floating around in the water.For Bali in a tourist area it is a reasonable beach.
Kev,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Aug 2019,"Very nice beach to take a stroll. Although you get HOUNDED by people trying to sell you things. You don't get left alone for too long, which gets annoying. "
Lilly H,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2020,"We love Double Six Beach and although we usually stay at a villa nearby we try to go there and maybe have a swim at least once during our stay.There are so many bars and restaurants you can choose from,some with live music and lots of atmosphere "
Adrian B,"Brighton, UK",Feb 2020,"Some nice bars along this beach but the amount of litter washed up was very disappointing, it is an OK beach but it isn't going to wow you "
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2020 • Couples,This beach was very close to our hotel and we used lots. It is a really busy place with lots to see and do and there is something for everyone.You can rent sun loungers on there for not too much money and there’s lots of places to get food or drink. It is very close to the main road so there are tons of shops and food outlets.Watersports feature prominently and there are many people who will teach you how to surf if you require it. The sea can get very rough so best to do it with professional help.
Kristian B,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Feb 2020 • Family,"Cool clean beach with great waves for surfing but the beach also offer good opportunities for long walks, loads of food and drinks in beach beanbags."
Peter R,"Liverpool, UK",Dec 2019,"Good beach, nice and clean,  good surf if you like that sort of thing.  I walked from Double Six down to Kuta beach and then returned north to Seminyak beach. A lovely afternoon barefoot walk."
Sogwan,2 contributions,Jan 2020,"The beach is clean and we were well settled in sunbeds. we can buy juice, water.... and fruits, coconutThere is the Sunday in the restaurant a brunch very good "
vanessasmith75,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019 • Friends,Nice spot to hang out with friends. We can see also sunset which is amazing. Beside that there are many options of restaurants we can choose along the beach. 
2TravellingGeordies,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Dec 2019 • Couples,Wrote a previous review up our stay in Seminyak and visiting the beaches here in Bali.Found Double 6 beach filled with plastics from high to low water. Nothing in the way of locals picking up the rubbish ranging from plastic bottle tops to plastic bags and old rope. How much damage is all this rubbish doing to marine life and not to mention the tourists entering these waters... the rubbish is not from tourism but from the rivers that flood once rain has fallen. Once you look beyond the rubbish I wonder how much none seen pollutants are in there!!!?.
Chris S,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"Great for surfing but not for swimming as the sea is too rough. Evenings are great as the bars & restaurants along the beach prepare for the amazing sunsets with lanterns, candles, comfy bean bag chairs & live music which all contributes to a memorable time"
kimseouhyoon,"Seoul, South Korea",Dec 2019 • Family,"The location is very close from city , you can enjoy the beach and buy coconut water during waiting the beautiful sunset"
stephenpysc,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"This is the section of the beach in Bali that is relaxed and has everything you need from water sports, to surfing, to chair and drinks. Great for sunset.!"
Dumbamakeche,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2019 • Couples,Good beach to spend our time while waiting for the golden hour (sunset) so many restaurant around here and local deli (Bakso gerobak biru) is delicious and affordable. 
Cameliapark,2 contributions,Aug 2019 • Couples,"It was my second time in Bali, still beautiful as always and this beach is the most beautiful here. Definitely will visit this beach every time i come to bali."
smithtan,12 contributions,Dec 2019 • Couples,Really recommended. One of the best place to get the magical sunset where many bar surriunding to entertain you.
Amanda & Moha,13 contributions,Oct 2019 • Couples,"Had so much fun at double six last time i was there im going again in the next few days. There will be a break in the rain and I'm there. Very impressed with the food but you cant beat the atmosphere with lanterns under coloured umbrellas. Have to mention the double apple shisha and the bands. The lovely happy staff and the waves crashing, its an awesome sunset."
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,"Double Six is a wide beach area between Seminyak and Kuta. A few hotels are next to it but it is one of the more underdeveloped areas of Bali. When we were there the beach was quite dirty, it was shocking to be honest, according to some reviews it has improved a lot it seems. We strolled along the beach all the way from Seminyak to Kuta and it is a fantastic beach walk, and once the sun starts to set even more picturesque."
