Moving Butler,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Apr 2021,"everyne walking arounf had no masks on, I seem to be the only dingdong doing so. There was plenty of trash everywhere and this was not becasue of the tourists either. A dog favorite ! This beach is not ready for the reopening of the area to an International market. "
Shree,15 contributions,Mar 2021 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"It is not as what it used to be, busy and crowded, but so quiet instead. Calm and peaceful sunset but I know many have lost their job. Hope things get better soon"
Chris R,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Always fun when the sun starts to set... seems all of Bali congregates at the beach at the end of the day! Awesome sunsets and dozens of choices for a place to relax for a drink or snack. 
Franky,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2021 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"One of the best beach for the enjoying the sunset. But, black sand. The beach in Legian would more recommended.Looking for food: many restaurants in the neighbourhood."
Ajay117,"Surat District, India",Sep 2020,"Seminyak beach is perfect place for morning walk and watching sunset. Not many cafe was open the time we did visit Bali, but its even better as it was clean and not so touristy."
AntioneSNorton,6 contributions,Apr 2020,"Great place to watch sunset, get some cold ones and chill with your partner. It was almost empty due to pandemic time, but as we read usually its very busy, especially for sunset time. Beach is very long, sand is nice and waves were to too big as in Kuta beach. Definitely will recommend to all my friends!"
Sisu1970,"Stuttgart, Germany",Aug 2020,We went to Bali for the duration of three weeks. Ubud was amazing bat Seminyak Beach is just very cool. Take your scooter and visit different places along the coatsline. Cool clubs and nice litte foody places... I do love a sundowner on this beach. Yes.Due Covid19 we unfortunately won`t be able to travel for a while. Keep this lovely island in your heart and just have a look at your photos over and over again. See you soon.
MADHURKJAIN,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2019,Pristine white sandy beach. Ideal place to relax or swim. Located in the vicinity of a chain of high end hotels. Amazing sunset views
Beau I,1 contribution,Jan 2020,"Beautiful sunset, and perfect time to social distancingWe can swim under the sunset before close your day."
ind,"England, UK",Sep 2019,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn‚Äôt list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we‚Äôre not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of ‚Äúsand on, stress off‚Äù after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn‚Äôt hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you‚Äôll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‚Äòmovers and shakers‚Äô, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‚Äòescape‚Äô and you‚Äôll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I‚Äôll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what‚Äôs not to like?....Indu & Versha."
Flare,"Helsinki, Finland",Mar 2019,"Dissapointment after Nusa Dua quiet beaches. This beach was a party beach, noicy, grouded and parties all night long."
Akash Goel,"Ghaziabad, India",Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach was beautiful but due to tourist a bit dirty. But nothing to take away from it. Beautiful feel with nice shacks with live singers
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,This beach was quite a walk from our hotel but we still made the effort to get there. It is generally clean (although this isn‚Äôt the case when the sea has been rough) and it‚Äôs long with great sand.You can rent sun loungers for your visit and there are several bars and restaurants to keep yourself fed and watered.The sea can get rough and lends itself quite well to surfing and other watersports. There are plenty of people around here who will teach you how to do it for a price.If you need to get there and back cheaply we used the Grab camp app which was really reliable and very cheap.
Val A,"Durban, South Africa",Feb 2020,This is about the best atmosphere at any beach. Loved the set up with 100s of umbrellas and tables and large bean bags/cushions for sitting. Drinks and light meals served on the shore. Excellent music
Lionel B,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2020,"If it is full for the sunset every evening, there are some good reasons: it is a wonderful beach, a legendary beach. And very clean for years. Perfect for families (kids can walk in the ocean in safety and enjoy the end of waves) or for adults who can enjoy bigger waves further. Many surf-schools all along for beginners, masseuses too, and a dozen of beach-bars/restaurants competing to attract the customers with decent prices for the food, drinks and services. It's summertime 365 days per year. The Beach Boys are locals, always happy (we wonder why? living on this beach!)"
sweetchloe39,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2020,It was said to be wet season in February but when I was there in early February there was barely any rain. Very lucky to see the gorgeous sunsets for a couple of times. 
Deborah C,101 contributions,Jan 2020,I was very disappointed by the state of the beach  tried to go to beach bar on beach we were not allowed to enter as we had bottled water and crisps in our bag 
harryphilpotter,"Weymouth, UK",Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Fantastic beach and not as dirty as everyone makes out. You see the odd bit of litter but nothing like you‚Äôd expect after reading reviews on here. A lot of pestering to buy usage of sun beds but just say no thank you and don‚Äôt stop to chat to the salesmen - they‚Äôre very friendly and not pushy though.
Emily,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2020,We visited Seminyak Beach for dinner. Amazing sunset views and many restaurants to visit and enjoy the view. 
Tony H,"Smiths Lake, Australia",Feb 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Awsome swimming & bars along the beach with seating at places like Chironguitos  seated on bean bags to watch a sunset whilst the world passes by üëçüëçüëç
Tim W,"Nottinghamshire, UK",Jan 2020,"We absolutely loved this beach, lots of lovely beach bars with very comfortable loungers, lovely sand lots of surfing, great cocktails, but amazing sunsets and a fabulous party vibe at night."
MariAlbiston,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Family,Nothing amazing. Lots of rubbish on the beach. Not very clean. And dogs. Eateries give it a nice feel. 
Tuuli,14 contributions,Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Solo,I was visiting Bali and stayed in Seminyak January 2020. The Petitenget beach was a total disappointment to me. I thought that in Bali the beaches were superb but Petitenget beach is really filthy and not at all atractive. The sand is full of plastic other rubbish and (hopefully) dog poop. There is no possibility to rent a beach bed so you have to actually lay your blanket on that dirty sand. Yaiks! 
Moretea,"Bourne End, UK",Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We walked to Seminyak beach and we pleasantly surprised at how lovely and peaceful it is compared to the madness of Kuta. There is also a chilled bar (Mano) which is great. There are still many big hotels on the beach and the town is fairly busy but for now this beach is a much better option of you prefer the'quiet' life!
Alnoor S,"Edmonton, Canada",Jan 2020,"Seminyak beach is amazing. Totally comparable to most famous Caribbean and and Dominican Republic beaches! We toured many beaches in Bali and Seminyak is the best in my judgement for a few reasons1) it is Flat!2) It is hard enough to run on and walk for miles and miles!3) The expanse of the beach area is very large and can accommodate thousands!4) Accessibility is easy, convenient and safe but subject to where you are staying. 5) Night time brings amazing g life to the beach areas and restaurant scene.6) Safety with most areas lit up. "
Rie06,"Chicago, IL",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Very nice beach. I went in the late afternoon, and it wasn‚Äôt very crowded. The beach is very clean, and the water was clear. Nice, relaxing experience. Know that you pay to use the loungers, and there are people selling things like sunglasses and bracelets."
Sue B,"East Fremantle, Australia",Jan 2020,"Good fun during day...very strong surf; & great beach side eats & drinks, with good choice. Colourful brollies & sun lounges for hire / hour....need towel or sarong.Evening...lovely sunset views, can book high rise restaurants for some glam.  & great food.     Sand a little coarse, but okay"
Shula K,44 contributions,Jan 2020,Something we haven‚Äôt seen before is the daily clean up of litter that dumps on the beach with each high ides.  Makes it so much more pleasant fir enjoying long walks. 
Terry A,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jan 2020 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Ok - it‚Äôs a little crowded in places and the surf could be a little daunting if you can‚Äôt swim. But it‚Äôs a great beach, plenty of space if you walk a little, and everywhere there are restaurants and bars for a cold drink or bite to eat.We really enjoyed our time here "
vanessasmith75,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Love staying at the beach for just relaxing or chit chat with family and friends. Beside double six area, sometimes i go to seminyak beach to spend time with family or friends. Not really clean beach but is ok. "
Marc W,"Austin, TX",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We were staying close so hot this beach several times. Nice sand, plenty of chairs and a great sunset. The guys that rented our chairs also had cheap beer, bonus. The water itself was nothing spectacular, big waves so no real swimming just wading. Surfing if your into it.lots of restaurants along the beach too."
Flaves73,"Bendigo, Australia",Nov 2019,"Seminyak beach is the best place to experience a breath taking Bali sunset. The beach comes to life as the sun goes down with live music, bars and seating."
Jignakp,"London, UK",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Lovely clear water. Very busy beach, so best to go early in the morning,  the water is not too cold. Very popular surfing location to. This beach is not rocky like dreamland beach further south"
fredamy65,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Plenty of space with minimal to nil hawkersRecommend if you are learning to surf. Predictable waves and not too big
Andrew O,"San Remo, Australia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Went to the beach club to have a couple of drinks to watch an amazing sunset , need to spend $50 Australian to have a day bed which is basically 4 mixed drinks Definitely a must to experience "
Rachael Colette,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"My husband and I strolled along the beach from 4.45pm till sunset at about 6pm. It was amazing! However, we noticed that dirty water flowed into the sea at certain parts along the beach. Although it is only natural, seeing and smelling it turned us off and we did not want to play in the water. Be vigilant to watch where you are walking as well because we found broken beer bottles shards in the sand. Overall, it was a beautiful beach and watching cute dogs run around the beach was a bonus. "
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Coming here my whole life, it‚Äôs a great beach and it‚Äôs clean. Lots of hotels etc around aswel as beach bars and little warungs. Great for all and also for having a walk with your dog ."
Empressb,3 contributions,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Lovely friendly beach with lots of colourful beanbags in my opinion its more of a evening beach hangout
Paul M,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,End the day watching the sun drop into the ocean. Sip on a cocktail spread out on the beanbags. Must do on your Bali itinerary.
Dave s,"Deal, United Kingdom",Nov 2019,"Quiet beach superb for surfing and lazing around,spectacular sunsets and great bars and music.sunbeds a must as its hot!"
Agnes Perez,"Manila, Philippines",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Most stylish and upscale beach resort! We enjoyed the vies and the water! We will come back for sure!
iamkayoh,472 contributions,Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Beach is pretty clean except for occasional bits of drink bottles left on the beach. Nice place to sunbathe with a ice cold Bintang or coconut! Beware of stalls charging overpriced drinks though. Check the price before ordering and sitting down at the beach chairs. One of them charged me IDR200K for a coconut!Do look out!
gypsygirl52,"Busselton, Australia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Staying in Seminyak only 3 Nights so.plenty to see and do.We did manage to get to see the Beach a shirt walk from  Seminyak Square.We did not hire Sun beds could have got them for 7000 each with a little bartering. The Beach was clean not much Surf that day.Lots of places to grab a bite to eat and a lovely place to watch the Sun Set.
Meg,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"The beach had soft sand and lots of beach chairs. There are heaps of restaurants, bars and surf schools along the beach here. The sand gets very hot in the sun, so we went at 8am to swim before it gets unbearable. Lots of street dogs, but they mostly leave you alone.Beautiful sunsets after 6pm, reccomend arriving around 5:30pm to take it all in."
Mark B,"Mosman, Australia",Nov 2019,"I visited Seminyak Beach because it was close to our Villa - but what a horrible beach. Black sand, dogs defecating and urinating everywhere. Rubbish blowing all over the place. I wouldn't go back."
Sanku,"Waidhan, India",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful beach. One of the Best Sunset View point. Clean beach & Good place to dive in. Lots of beach side Cafe & Pubs are there. These are one of the best Beach Clubs of Bali. Must visit place. 
Darlene K,"Colorado Springs, CO",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Many beachfront restaurants to choose from  to enjoy watching the beautiful sunset while you eat dinner. It is popular, so you will be in the company of many who are in celebratory moods. In contrast, early morning walks on this same beach are quiet and peaceful."
Elyze,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"We are here to watch the sunset. A lot of restaurants by the beach and a lot of locals trying to sell you things. Nevertheless, it is still a good place to chill and have a long romantic walk with your loved ones."
Palesa,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Loved it. Absolutely... little to no waves, I‚Äôm happy with the small restaurant there, great service and very friendly"
stephanie C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2019,"We ended up having an evening stroll along the beach around sunset which we thorougly enjoyed.Had we wanted an evening meal,there were numerous well patronised  restaurants from which we could have chosen. The beach was clean and others like us, both locals and tourists were taking advantage of using this lovely spot for recreational purposes."
pmickey,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The beach is very clean , we where here in oct November the flags most days where red and yellow, good to play in the water near shore line , or surf , but not great for swimming, could have been this time of year, but it was really nice sand , and clean and not many vendors asking you to buy something, "
N2N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,We just took a walk along the beach and enjoyed the sunset. Definitely great beach to visiting whilst in Seminyak.
Pedro L,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Oct 2019,"Expensive umbrella/chair rentals and signs say swimming is prohibited, although people ignored that restriction.  Still, it was nice scenery."
Tracey R,31 contributions,Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,beach was beautiful nice breeze from see all day clean and tidy. only pitiful is the the people who sell on the beach dont listen when you tell them no. other than that beautiful clean beach
nonina70,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Nov 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,You can enjoy by staying at places that have condition minimum order start from 100k..the difference only the place higher because they give more exclusive place
colleen t,"Winchelsea, Australia",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Last time I was in Seminyak was four years ago and I can‚Äôt believe the change in the condition of the beach.Clean and uncluttered!!!Great work to all
John C,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Great beach, great sun beds  Some surf schools and beach side massage During the day it is quite as the sun sets the place gets busy with some music But the Sunset is spectacular "
Stan S,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Came here to see the sun set. Beautiful white sandy beach with clear waters. Lovely view of sun-set. There is a swing with the words Petitenget ideal for Instagram. No drinks stalls or cushions littering the beach like Kuta. Less commercialized. One word - beautiful.
jane s,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Nothing better than spending a sunset at the beach. Grab a beanbag a cocktail menu and your in for a great time with friends 
Rodney J,"Neutral Bay, Australia",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Just beautiful, better than I could of imgined. A great way to walk from the many resorts and beachfront restaurants."
Pathfinder221035,2 contributions,Oct 2019,"Not many beach bed options, but it was quiet when we were there. The current is strong and would not be suitable for young children."
G & H Travel,"Essex, UK",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The beach itself is okay, the sunbeds are really comfy and you can get two sunbeds for 3 hours for 150k. There are a few nice restaurants. The sunset is amazing though and this is why you come here. It is however quite touristy and the sea is quite rough so be careful."
Anne T,3 contributions,Oct 2019,This beach is not the golden sand with palm trees I was expecting. The sand is fine but the sea is dangerous. The waves and current are deceiving. There are red flags saying do not swim between and the life guards are constantly blowing their whistles to get you out of the water. The waves are  reminiscent of the Posiden Adventure!!!!
PhoenixT,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Oct 2019,"The beach is not ideal for swimming and current is strong and waves can be high plus I believe is not very clean either. But great for sunsets and the atmosphere at that time is so good with bars and beach huts are filled with people and singers, highly recommended for this experience."
Wayne,3 contributions,Oct 2019,Awesome beach. Great to see the beach is swept of litter each morningWould recommend too all. Night music/entertainment and plenty of bean bags to lounge on.
Lorie R,20 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing, vast beach.  Great for a walk, at times the surf is quite high.  Have to get used to the ladies and gentlemen peddling their wares on the beach. "
Lata P,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach is crowded but nothing like seeing the sun set in the ocean. Yes of course you will have better choices to see the beach at Gili islands or in uluwatu. But the beach wasn't dirty just crowded.
Frank M,"Glasgow, UK",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. Sit and relax with a cold drink. It‚Äôs awesome you can hire a decked seat or just layOn the beach. Lots of surfers to watch.
Prof. Andrew John y Fernandes,"Valenzuela, Philippines",Oct 2019,"The usual Asian beach with grey sand, warm waters and features a longer sand base. Sadly, quite dirty"
danielle166,"Medan, Indonesia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,It's must to watch sunset here.Sandy beach with whole lot crowd but it's still has its own beauty. Go around 5 p.m. you should go earlier though to avoid traffic jam.You'll see one of the most amazing sunset here.
sasidar30,"Coimbatore, India",Oct 2019,I guess it‚Äôs the most busiest beaches in Bali... I see a lot of local connect like the Sanur and unlike the nusa dua beach..It‚Äôs pretty hot in October.. so you have to carry what ever is necessary 
Rod W,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The reality is that it is extremely hotThere's no white sand, it's grey gravel and no real surf.Hence no one is there.Plus the rubbish, everywhere "
Geordie K,"Cavite City, Philippines",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach is very popular and a great place to watch the sunset. Lots of surfing going on and you must stay within the flags to avoid the rip currents but it is very safe and plenty of food and drinking available all along the beach 
Gus Dark,Indonesia,Aug 2019,"Geez, they should build big parking building, a Multistorey car park on the empty land near the beach otherwise sooner or later people will come with bad atmosphere, which make the awesome sunset beach fullfilled with negative atmosphere caused by bad traffic around the area. Stop build Hotels or beach clubs here, all stackholders in this areas should re-think again about where Seminyak going in the near future."
Amit Agarwal,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"This is the best I found in Bali, have many restaurants with shisha / Liquor and lovely food.One should try it"
luxurytraveller1964,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,The beach was clean and safe.  Lots of tourists and a wonderful way to enjoy the Bali culture.  Not too many locals looking to sell their wares makes this a relaxing location and perfect for watch the sun set each evening.
ozsarah,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Fantastic beach and a great place to watch the surfers. Great beach lounges so you don‚Äôt have to be on the sand. 
Graham Dinwoodie,"Glasgow, UK",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Stunning beach very clean not to busy plenty to do from surfing to scuba diving and just having a beer and watching what has got to be the most romantic sunset to watch with your wife 
Eka A,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"This part of the beach is flat and long beach. You can do pretty much many activities, surf, soccer, swimming in the ocean, ride, kite flying, etc, etcBefore Sunset, many hotels and restaurants will put a bean bag along the beach and pumping with music. Love it Love it"
Dharmadji5,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Could not sleep so I decide to take an early walk and catch a sunrise. To my wonderful surprise how fresh air and sandy beach while waiting for sunrise can be rejuvenated myself! There weren‚Äôt many people, but jogger and Jetleg tourist w their selfie mode were a few. Walked for an hour and finally watched the sun cracking the horizon to begin the new day. It‚Äôs plain beautiful thing to start your day in Bali. Perfecto"
Lesha G,"Durban, South Africa",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful shoreline. Amazing sunset. You do not have to drive all the way to Jimbaran for a stunning sunset. 
–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –§,"Moscow, Russia",Sep 2019,"TL;DR: Hands down the best beach in Bali.Okay, the situation is a bit silly. We came to the Seminyak from the airport at night, didn‚Äôt like the traffic and decided to see all the best beaches first before deciding where to live.So the next day at the early morning we started to explore them (not seeing Seminyak beach first!).Canggu, Munggu, Jimbaran, Dreamland, Melasti, Padang-Padang, Sanur (and some other places along the way) - whole day drive.Came back frustrated at night, no amazing beaches, if you were in Philippines, Thailand, Goa etc you understand, Bali beaches are average at best. Yeah, Melasti wedding pictures are nice, but it‚Äôs not for swimming, living and relaxing.Next day we saw Seminyak beach 100m from our hotel (right at the Ku De Ta).Ocean waves, tender and smooth light yellow sand, wide and bright beach kilometers long.It‚Äôs perfect.Seminyak is the most expensive place for a reason."
Siska B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,If you can learn to say no to the people selling you things while you lay on your subbed you paid $10 for with umbrella for the whole day you will love the beach in seminyak. Restaurants near buy who will deliver to your  day bed ! In all t yhe photos o had seen thought it would be a dirty beach but was lovely even the water was amazing. 
Irena N,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"We stayed at the Anantara hotel. It was fabulous - for service, pools, Buffet breakfast dinner experiences rooftop bar and restaurant. The staff could not have been more helpful or polite or just genuinely friendly and concerned for our enjoyment. "
Asenster,"Burgas, Bulgaria",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"It is very nice wide beach. It is perfect to drink cocktails, watch sunsets, listening live music, sunbathing, eat!"
Farkwad,"Agnes Water, Australia",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Awesome western sunsets into the Water with well priced beers sun beds and restaurants. Great swimming and fun for the whole family. 
Benholhar,"Penarth, UK",Sep 2019,Lovely setting to watch sunset on beach with a cocktail or two. Plenty of choice for drinks and views gets busy around 5pm so find a seat early 
Nick9289,"Castle Donington, UK",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great time to walk on the beach just before sunset. It is very clean with very nice views to look at. 
Arun714,"Hokkaido, Japan",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Great beach for sunsets, walks, kiteflying, playing in the sand relaxing on deckchairs and learning how to surf. Not good for swimming."
Louise P,"Cabarita Beach, Australia",Sep 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,We loved Seminyak Beach! It‚Äôs clean and the water is beautiful. It‚Äôs busy at sunset everyday but there‚Äôs plenty of room to spread out and countless beach clubs to sit and watch the sunset from. It‚Äôs way better than the pictures you see on the internet. Seminyak is a great place in Bali to visit ‚ù£Ô∏è
SteveDWS,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Water is murky and is actually quite rough in most areas. Lack of bars and restaurant indicates it is not really for tourists. Of 3 days we visited once for 10 minutes. Ordinary. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
San P,"Moncton, Canada",Aug 2019,"Super nice day at the beach, the only downfall was getting approached all the time for renting chairs or buying goods!"
Caitlyn S,10 contributions,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Nice enough, soft sand, very strong current in water and big dumping waves. In my opinion I would say not safe for swimming, but OK to paddle if you're careful."
ckrken,5 contributions,Aug 2019,"You have to visit Seminyak forget Kuta that has just gone downhill. Seminyak is the place to stay, go to Double Six beach, meet Judi, Lollipop, Ina, Tina, Jennifer, Eric, Milky, Martin and the rest of the sellers and beer boys.  Best place in the world to buy a beer and sit in comfort and watch the world go buy.  Buy your souvenirs or get your nails done even have a massage I can personally guarantee you will get a better deal and treatment from these people than any of the shops, markets or spas that you attend.  We did.  There are so many warangs to get cheap meals, it is cheaper to stay here than any place in Kuta or Legian. Kura-Kura buses run regularly and travel all over the main parts of Bali. I simply can go on and on but go and find out yourself."
Vera Z,"Beirut, Lebanon",Aug 2019,"The beach in Seminyak is amazing especially for Surfers, but not that good for swimmers since it's always high tide. The entrance is free but if you want to sit on a bed you will have to pay around 100K Rupiah per bed if you have good negotiable skills since they can ask for more."
Elenishaz,26 contributions,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Sunset in beautiful Seminyak never disappoint. This is my 16th Bali trip and always love looking across the ocean and watching the sunset
Denise P,"Australind, Australia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Relax or get surf lessons clean beach very relaxing can get a massage or buy things Small restaurant serving local food beer and food 
Brook R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,For one of Bali‚Äôs main beaches this is disappointing. Whereas some effort has been made to tidy it up particularly in front of the nicer hotels many people are taking their dogs for a walk and making no effort to big up their poo from the sand so not a pleasant walking experience. Also still many strays despite efforts to collar some of them. There are also a few streams emanating from the town that run across the beach with foul smelling water to paddle through. Not many people sunbathing in it which probably sums it up.
ECB,20 contributions,Aug 2019,Loved the choice of restaurants and sunsets. Beautiful beach with golden sand. Will visit soon. Very romantic. 
dotdim,"Keysborough, Australia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Amazing and clean beach with great waves.  No crazy hustle here. Hotels and bars right at your fingertips.  Great spot to chill or satin or go for that brisk walk or run
SmilyBergen,"Bergen, Norway",Aug 2019,"Great sand, funny waves, lovely sunset, not too crowded. Sunbeds costs 100.000 each. Hope to be back!"
quiknett,"Springfield, MO",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Seminyak is a better location then kita,  for elder people like me , prefer  Semnyak then Kuta too crowded and noisy. Seminyak has a better store  too."
Scott T,"Bangkok, Thailand",Aug 2019,The beach is fantastic. Approximately 100 meters from shore to where the beach ends. A number of beach pubs with live music in the evening.. very relaxing. The waves rolling in add that hypnotic vibe.
Jay Murray,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Beach is a must see - just be ready for the market sellers there - lovely people who are there to make a living for themselves, they go around selling their wares, be polite in saying no - other tourists there just ignore them - which I found was quite rude. A nice ‚Äòthank you - but no thanks‚Äô goes a long way."
StephanieJeffrey,"Winsford, UK",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Such a stunning beach to watch the sunset. There is a swing on the beach also which is a lovely touch. It was fairly clean and tidy. Lots of bars along the beach and chill out spots 
Timo10101,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Bali is famous for many things, however beaches and sea swimming is not the best here, unless you're a surfer. The water was cold - expected as it's an ocean, and the sea waves were quite strong and turning any swim attempt into a soft fight. "
Wulan C,17 contributions,Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great spot but overcrowded ..dogs roaming around..cafe s expensive went to Botanica for froze and sangria just behind the beach..
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful sunset!!! Loved watching the big waves crashing and seeing local Balinese families enjoying the beach/offering blessings. Don't miss the sunset - its magical.
holdayluv,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We went to go to the beach only to find that to get on and off the beach, if you are not staying at the beachfront resorts is a nightmare. You have to walk miles out of your way to get on and off the beach which has open drains emptying into it that smell terrible. I hated walking through the dirty water."
Ruud & Debby,"Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Go here if you like to enjoy the sunset while having a nice cocktail on the beach. Lots of beach bars and beach clubs to choose from. A bit more expensive then Kuta, but therefore also a bit more stylish."
CassavaHK,"Sandik, Indonesia",Aug 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Having been to quieter beaches this was packed and really not that nice. Way too busy, noisy and touts everywhere.  If you like the buzz, crowds then it‚Äôs the beach for you. If you like privacy and peace stay away. Sunset was nice but you can‚Äôt take a decent photo without a single person in it! "
S p,5 contributions,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"I'm writing this review to warn the many people that come to Seminyak beach of the very powerful currents in this part of the beach which could be deadly. Many people have died including my cousin who just drowned 3 days ago getting caught in the rip tide. He was a very good swimmer with exceptional athletic ability, but the currents on this beach are very strong and come all of a sudden. There are many articles on this if you search specifically for it,  but they get no publicity because the big corporate hotels need to keep the tourists coming in. My advice is you can stay in the hotels, but please find another beach to swim in. Please read up on rip tide currents if you do plan to stay there. The site wont allow me to post links to other sites. Thank you"

EveT205,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,I like this beach. Nothing much to fault but i just wish the washroom can be free and more water points to wash off our sandy feet.

Razor Ray,"County Meath, Ireland",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Took a walk down seminyak beach with my 2 teenage boys and it was sad to see the amount of rubbish lying on the beach. There  is a stream that flows into the sea there also and it is basically a dustbin with all sorts of rubbish dumped in it which is flowing into the ocean. It is very sad and it is something the Indonesian government needs to address. Aside from that the beach is a surfers beach with huge waves. Could be so beautiful.....
Joanna L,"Davao City, Philippines",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Such a striking difference from the other beaches.  Seminyak beach has a classier atmosphere, so much space, and it doesn't have the haggling vendors at Kuta beach.  The price to lounge, for food and drinks is much more here but you get what you pay for."
Guillex13,"Mendoza, Argentina",Jul 2019,"Nice beach and large so you could be in a place without others next to you.A black sand beach, big waves, if you like surf that's the location.Big and beautiful sunsets, book a place in one of the beach sand places restaurants and enjoy.For me it's a 7."
Natty,World,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We like Seminyak beach. Very nice beach & clean. Good for walk on the beach. You can spend time long day. Have many restaurants & Hotel. Beautiful the Sunset there...Will be back soon.üíÉüå∫Nattyüï∫üå∫Walter 
Richard S,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Love going to this beach maybe because it feels like I‚Äôm home every time I go there know a lot of people and have good friendships over the years ... restaurant close by everything is busy on a Sunday afternoon 
moviegeekjn,"Phoenix, AZ",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"After seeing only underwhelming Sanur Beach previously, Seminyak Beach represents its polar opposite. The sunsets are fabulous and there are many entry points to this beautiful beach with fine sand; it's like I told my traveling partner: this place is like a ""poor man's Maldives.""  This area will be my primary beach area if and when I return to Bali"
Rob w,28 contributions,Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Seminyak beach is a great place to hang out for those sundowners after a hard day‚Äôs surfing and watch the sunset with a cold beer or cocktail sitting on one of the many rainbow beanbags!
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"loved the sunset view ,local food,vibes of the beach..surfing shots....every bit of it...clean beach but crowded....you can spend the whole day"
Deanne,"Coulsdon, UK",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"It‚Äôs a great beach but it‚Äôs packed from dawn to dusk with people it‚Äôs more like Costa Del Sol. There are so many nicer beaches in Bali but then Seminyak is all about clubs, restaurants, bars etc so it depends what you‚Äôre looking for. "
Ben D,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This beach is similar to Kuta, grey sand, and strange milky creeks flowing out into the water. I would not swim in that. I didn‚Äôt particularly like walking on the sand.Seminyak is to me, a quieter version of Kuta, but with nicer shops, better food, and more relaxed locals and tourists.I love Seminyak, just don‚Äôt bother going to the beach."
Sian F,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,We visited Double Six area of Seminyak beach and everything was very nice. We watched the sunset one night and if you want lounge chairs you have to pay. We paid $20 for 5. There are many bars and places to eat and it wasn‚Äôt too busy. 
Georgia,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Loads of cool we spots , lounges cost about $2.50 NZ for a day . Bean bags are free as long as you buy food and drinks . Surf lessons cost  are between $20-$30 for a hour and half lesson or $5-$10 for surfboard hire for 2 hours . Awesome music and vibes "
ADL Foodie,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"Beach is great for sunsets, waves were big, san was dirty and stray dogs everywhere. Prefer the Australian beaches! "
globalfoodie87,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"The sand lacks luster, but great to surf...you can access for free if you walk just past potato head, or go through them and order lunch then use the beanbags provided. "

Leah C,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Good spot to learn to surf.  Sand is a mix of black volcanic and silica, so looks fairly good and very little rubbish.  Lots of access points on to the beach and variety of pop-up style bars."
ed edwards,Fiji,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Expansive beach that has awful riptides. Lots of umbrellas and and lounge chairs. All are for hire. Swim at your hotel pools.
Finemind1st,"Seattle, WA",Jul 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Spent some time in the sun and people watched. Time well spent! There's tons of hotels/bars/restos to get lunch or dinner at when/if you get hungry. Enjoy!
samchy,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach in Seminyak is okay but there are plenty more that are much better. The beach is average and we only went there for a walk in the evening. There are plenty restaurants near by so a good walk and many places to eat after the walk. 
Lauren01,"Porthcawl, UK",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We have spent a few days at the beach near Seminyak. The beach is clean, offers small waves for surfing and was monitored by lifeguards. "
flynniesmum,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Lovely at sundown but so many hawkers! If you can put up with trying to relax but be awoken by the locals aiming to sell then youll love it. Great bars & restaurants
Grant B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"A difficult to access beach hidden on the ""other"" side of a number of large villas and hotels.  You can reach it down a path at Ku De Ta or at Jalan Kayu Aya, just along from Motel Mexicola.  If you are of the white Kiwi or Aussie brigade take your sunscreen and pay for a sun umbrela if you intend to spend any time at the beach.I am not a surfer but the surf was quite large and to my untrained eye seemed to be what a number of doctors might order grommets and experts alike to savour.  I presume the waves arose from beach breaks, and on the day we were there we observed a number of perfect A frames."
AliciaCecilia,"Guangzhou, China",Jun 2019,"The beach is long. Connected with Kuta  and Legian and Petinget or something similar . Well is the same beach . It is not paradise at all . You can not swim only if you are a fan of surfing and beach clubs to drink and watch sunset . Of course nice for long walks.  At sunset is lively , full of local people and dogs  .... too many . No very clean . They have to clean every day with machines and full of offerings little basket with flowers . The nice touch is the colorful umbrellas and lounges  to relax ."
Edenescape S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Relatively clean , good thunderous surf the days we visited, plenty of surf schools , people watching and beach club options . Lovely sunset ....  a loud and busy place "
DianneKamerling,"Cooroy, Australia",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Nice beach, with some good bars/eateries along the foreshore, not much surf as such, but great for children to go swimming"
TJ1,"Johannesburg, South Africa",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Looks like any other beach, not the crystal clear and blue green beaches seen in photos. Good to just chill for the afternoon where you can hire sunbeds and an umbrella. Also good walking distance from Seminyak Square and Village "
Geary W,3 contributions,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Just returned from a amazing trip to Bali, where during our 14 day adventure we visited Ubud, Sanur, Nusa Dua and Seminyak which unfortunately was the low point of our trip. We had been to Seminyak on a previous visit to Bali and didn't have any problems but this time We fell foul of unscrupulous money changers. They used misdirection and slight of hand to scam us out of approx 1 million Rupiahs. My advice is stick to the main money changers on main roads and always double check your cash before walking away. I went back and confronted my foe's and they claimed that i had dropped the money as I walked away which of course was rubbish, I did however manage to get half of the ill gotten gains back from them when they thought i might have called the police."
PeCi,"Bratislava, Slovakia",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"It has all a tourist needs - little bars and restaurants, surf rentals and of course sun umbrellas & sunbeds to rent for about 150K Rp..Its not as crowded as Kuta, which we personally appreciated."
Penny L,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We went there on both nights of our trip to chill and to relax. With the second day, we rented two beach chairs for my Boyfriend to suntan for 3hours (@ 200k rupiah). Since the main purpose of our trip was to relax, the sun sand and sea combination was heaven for us. Together with the little drinks and the stars in the sky. With the sound of waves (and of course the music) we had a really relaxing trip. And I‚Äôm missing the beach pretty badly at his moment."
Coenie K,"Riebeek-West, South Africa",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Stayed in a beautiful hotel,only you realise the beach were not great.Dirty sand,plastic and cigarette buds everywhere. Come on people be proud and ≈∫"

thaibanana,manchester,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"As a keen swimmer I was slightly disappointed that the waves and surf were too strong to go swimming. The beach is large and flat, and you can walk along it for miles. There are plenty of people hiring loungers etc. We liked all the beach bars with their brightly coloured bean bags! At night the beach comes alive, with beautiful sunsets and bands/ singers at most of the beach bars. Very relaxing except for the hawkers of which there were many! Just saw a review below about effluent and can agree - upon walking northwards along the beach towards seminyak square, there was quite a fast flowing creek that stunk. Take care where you bathe I think! There were also dogs running around and on our walks we did pass the occasional dog turd. We did see people cleaning the beach and overall it was pretty clean with just a few trouble spots."
Shelley Mac,5 contributions,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach was relaxing with it's wide sand and good surf. Great that you can walk along the beach for miles and also call in to visit places all along the way.
MarcieBenton0186,6 contributions,Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We came to Bali for beach, but this one is not what we were expected when we booked our tickets to here. Grey sand, rubbish, positive side sunsets are amazing here."
MLandM,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"While walking along Seminyak beach just north of Moonlight I crossed a creek. Brown, raw, stinking effluent was pouring into the ocean right near swimmers and surfers. About 200 litres per minute. That's 10 tonnes per hour. When I asked them, the locals knew but didn't care. It was disgusting. The prevailing current carries it northwards.Be warned. Do yourself a favour, surf Double Six instead."
siongl76,4 contributions,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,This beach is a nice place to chill and recommended for sunset. The sand is fine and suitable to laze around and sun bathing. However it is not recommended for swim.

orientdesign,wateringen,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"in the center of Seminyak and enjoy the sunset on a beautiful beach. It can be super crowded but very cozy. Keep your attention, because if you order a cocktail during the rush, it may be that there is almost no alcohol in it. It happened to us in any case."
Loislovestravelling,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"It is good to visit..... but just the once. To be honest, unless you want to sit and drink, there isn‚Äôt much more to do. "
mkaes,"Luzon, Philippines",Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Great place to watch the sunset, resto bars are here and there, make sure you choose the best spot with great drinks menu and live music, bring your tripod to capture the timelapse of the sunset, make sure you bring enough money as the drinks are pricey! "
Deetee100,"London, UK",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"This coastline on the western side of Bali, starting from Kuta, through Legian to Seminyak is very heavily commercialised, so the beach is lined with hotels and bars and, although kept relatively clean, is still far from somewhere to relax. There are surf schools along the entire length, then people trying to sell you everything from coconuts to sarongs and hats. You‚Äòll have to venture further away from Denpassar to escape the crowds."
FamilyWillow,173 contributions,May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,As usual there were numerous dogs defacating on the beach. It's strewn with rubbish and there is a large drain flowing with poluted water.Don't let the photos cool you.
Erwin,"Ede, The Netherlands",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,During sunset and after sunset on this beach the bars have live music and often 'happy hour' cocktails. Easy to have a few great nights.
MishyTravels,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This beach is great for keeping active, with flat firm sand perfect for walking, jogging or running.The beach is clean and scraped every morning.There are a few friendly dogs but the area comes alive at night with movies or live music, fairy lights, cocktails and food a plenty.Perfect for singles, couples or families"
Frank G,"West Pennant Hills, Australia",Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,There is no way I will ever go back to this beach.  It is the filthiest piece of ocean and sand I have ever seen  Authorities really need to clean this up. No thank you.

Herdiana Surachman,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"When in Bali, me with friends always come to Petitenget Beach to enjoy the beach while waiting for sunset.Different with Kuta where on the bach so many locals sunbed, and in Double Six where so many beach bar.In Petitenget's Seminyak beach you can take your own beach towel and have your own time. Of course, there's still locals try to sell products or food, but it's because Petitenget is public beach but sometime is clearer than the two (Kuta & Double Six)"
Mariatynan,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach was clean this time of year. Lots of restaurants where we go. Champlung is our favourite. Balinese are all pleasant.
Matthew D,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Apr 2019,"OK maybe I‚Äôm spoiled a bit by living in sight of a great beach and holidays in the Pacific Islands but I don‚Äôt particularly rate this one. Long sandy beach, not too crowded, some nice beachside bars and restaurants. The surfing is OK (again, spoiled by Hawai‚Äôi and Aotearoa) but not great. Absence of lifeguards and presence of undertow make swimming an issue. Some rubbish- not as bad as Phuket, worse than the Pacific. An oil slick present while we were there. As beaches go, if you‚Äôre looking for a long walk on a beach ((with a reasonable number of people there but not crowded or noisy) with some places to get a beer or some decent food at reasonable prices you won‚Äôt go wrong with this. But it‚Äôs not spectacular and lack of swimming or natural shade that you don‚Äôt have to pay for are an issue. "
badhabbits05,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Nice and relaxing sunset drinks you will get hassled by locals selling kites, bracelets and all other items"
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach in Seminyak is not as wide as in other areas of Bali but it is fairly clean and also perfect for a stroll. Compared to Kuta it is also cleaner. Not many people are in the water though.The best part are the sunsets which are simply stunning viewed from Seminyak. Best is to go to one of the beach clubs and enjoy the view from there.
Krossprocess,"Rowville, Australia",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Literally full of commercial rubbish! The live music venues at night are the only reason to visit this beach mainly because the beach gets raked and the rubbish is hidden in the dark. 
Paul in Frankfurt,"Frankfurt, Germany",May 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Pleasant but ... not my favorite... there‚Äôs open sewage and a fair amount of trash that washes up on the beach from god knows where? all sorts of PLASTIC trash is around and incredibly sad to witness. Why isn‚Äôt Bali aggressively working on picking up trash from its once pristine beaches? Non biodegradable PLASTIC shouldn‚Äôt just sit on the beach - it‚Äôs dirty and harmful to the environment. This is what happens when they‚Äôve got 5 million visitors per year ... 
Ryan B,"Camps Bay, South Africa",Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"When we went to visit my wife and i werent overly impressed. The beach had quite a bit of rubbish on it, the water was very murky and churned up from the big waves and it just didnt compare to other beaches i have been to around the world."
higgos@gmail.com,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak is that little bit quieter than Legian and definitely quieter than Kuta. Mostly high-end resorts so not a lot happening on the beachfront. Most of the resorts have restaurants/bars open to the public, including the excellent The Samaya, so it's well worth a drink or a meal looking over Seminyak Beach. Ok for surfing but the banks never quite form properly so it's hard to find a consistent peak. The quality of the water is hit and miss, use your sense. If it's been raining a lot and there's a lot of storm-water run-off or, (especially) you can see plastic bags, etc. in the water then stay out pf the water for a few days."
ExcitedTraveller1973,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,On our visits to Seminyak beach it was just out from our hotel - Royal Beach by MGallery. It was kept clean and the guys out front selling bintang and soft drinks were all good. Not as many hawkers selling items as other parts of the beach which has its good points!
Maria B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We are not surfers, but real beach lovers - we would never consider sunbathing on this beach. The sea is quite rough, the beach itself is not very clean. Watching the sunset is the only reason to visit Seminyak beach in my opinion."
Sunshine307,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Seminyak Beach is still one of the cleanest along here.Lots of beautiful cafes and restaurants to relax in and watch the waves or catch a breathtaking sunset while sipping on s cocktail.

JamesCowcher,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Go running, go for a swim , lie on the beach or drink beer at sunset. It‚Äôs all good. I was staying in the hotel indigo which has direct beach access and beach views from the hotel. I would recommend Seminyak over other beaches."
Astri F,6 contributions,Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"I admire sunset in Seminyak Beach. This beach is not a quiet place to enjoy sunset while reading a book, but to catch a beautiful sunset? This is one of the must visit place.I love to see the wave and it sounds so calming. They provide many bean bag there, so you can choose any spot to catch the sunset. For some cafe they need you to make reservation before you come to get the best spot. But overall it was a great sunset.So, go catch your sunset in Seminyak Beach and enjoy the moment there."
Jim W,"Guam, Mariana Islands",Apr 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Waves are a bit rough for swimming but perfect for surfing and the Long Beach run  was absolute perfection.  But...the best part....the sunset.

Craig F,16 contributions,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"I understand February is offseason in Bali, however, the weather was nice, surf was up, not too many people on the beach or in the water.  Always lots of available sun lounges with umbrellas.  Only complaint is the very gradual slope of the beach, so you have to go WAY out to be in water above waist level.  Actually, one other complaint and its a big one, the people coming up to you every 5 minutes trying to sell you something.  Just want to close my eyes and chill, right?  Very annoying. Oh yeah, one more thing...walked to the beach from Potato Head and on the way walked through a river of sewer water flowing into the ocean.  Yuk.   But don't think that's super close to the public beach, was hard to tell at night.  Anyway, also have fresh coconut water for sale and showers for use for a small fee.  Great beach overall"
Bas F,"Roosendaal, The Netherlands",Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,It is a beautifull beach with nice sands and relatively calm des. Many possibillities to enjoy a longer stay here.Drinks and bites available.
Rodney M,"St Peters, Australia",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"The beach is always fun to walk along , I find it best early in the morning or later in the afternoon as it does get very hot .It‚Äôs a surf beach so be prepared for some strong waves or currents and swim where the flags are.There is many spots you can hire chairs or just stop for a cool drink , there are a lot of  Balinese selling sarongs jewellery etc but if you take the time talk to them they do have interesting stories to share .You also are able to grab a massage along the beach and there is no shortage of food . I find the best way to walk down to Legion or Kuta as it does not seem as far compared to walking the main streets.When the tide is out there is some rubbish that you will see and the locals try to clean the beach up as much as possible ."
VWDest,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Seminyak beach is a okey beach with a lot of nice restaurants and surfing spots and companies renting you surfing gear, but the beach feels a bit dirty..Not so much the beach actually more the plastic coming up on shore..Everyday I cleaned plastic coming up from the ocean.It‚Äôs so sad what we the human race are doing to our planet."

For swimminf I like Karma beach or Melasti beach next to Karma. On the Seminyak you can go to Potato Beach Club and have fun there all day from 10am to 1am. Deposit is 1 million for bed. Maximum 6 persons. You can get drinks and food for these money. At night I went to ""Mirror"" night club and ""La Favela"". i liked them and I really had fun there. Night clubs normally close at 3pm there.Enjoy your holidays!Yours Olga Korneva ;)"
Int_Academic,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,I've visited the beach many times. The first time I saw masses of plastic particles on the tide line where you might expect to see shells and seaweed.This time perhaps because it coincided with Chinese New Year the beach seemed pristine.  It was clear that this was due to a concerted effort to rake and collect the plastic. Full marks hotels / council i cant express how important this aspect is to visitors. And thank you for the beautification of the roadside with plants. It has made a massive difference.
Jonas W,"Stockholm, Sweden",Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Beach is unfortunately not so nice anymore, lots of plastic and stuff. Surfing is ok still, but the beach is not for swimming due to waves and currents. Beach side hotels and restaurants are not especially nice either; more pricey the just a block above and the value for the extra sea view is overrated. Better beaches just north of.We had one stop there and never went back. "
Aj92,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Very average beach, thank goodness i don't see much rubbish after i heard there was a ban for single use plastic. It's nice to see the sunset there if you like walks on the beach and have some cocktails in the bars there. Watch out for some dogs that poop in some parts of the beach. Other than that it's good to go early in the morning there as well. If you are going by a motorcycle or car there is parking fee which is about 500 rp."
rene z,"Tamarindo, Costa Rica",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We went for a beach walk at 6:30am and the amount of garbage on the beach was appalling. Cleaning crews were working but it‚Äôs sad to see so much plastic and other types of garbage on the beach. With so much income crom tourism the Balinese government ought to invest in educating people about littering...
T D N,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"This beach is quaint and simple (and a little bit stinky). Don‚Äôt expect much and you‚Äôll enjoy it. It‚Äôs a beautiful walk to La Plancha or similar, yet it‚Äôs so heartbreakingly covered in rubbish and debris. "
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Hotels offering Western style comfort, restaurants with a bit of everything, disco's with loud bass sounds and amplifiers on the beach (hard rock, hiphop, disco, Beatles and Stones from the 1960s). Lots of cold beer. Not to mention vendors and other local service providers. Great for watching sunsets and having a party.Quite unique are the big waves, but they also carry a lot of rubbish to the beach. A result of a poor waste collection system on the island and of course large industries that wrap their goods in plastic. 80% of the garbage on Seminyak beach comes from rivers that wash it down into the ocean. Especially during the rainy season it is a big problem."
Kyla L,11 contributions,Feb 2019,"An average looking beach that is made to look much worse because of all the garbage washed ashore. They going rate for sun chairs seems to be 200K for two people, which is way more than other places and you don‚Äôt even get access to food or toilets! Would never come back. "
TheMoni17,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,It is a nice soft white sand beach with many restaurants and shacks lined up on the edges. We went there for a stroll with our footwears in our hands but had to be very careful while walking as there was too much waste & garbage being thrown at this beach. I think Bali government should limit the commercialisation here and make strict rules for the vendors and sellers to ensure that their customers do not litter. And should also impose fine on the people/visitors who litter. 
Ferry A,"San Mateo, Philippines",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,We went there for dinner. Relaxing and colorful bean chairs all over. Went to a resto with live singers. Friendly staff. We loved their pizza and chicken wings. A variety of drinks too. 
janetlim18,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Nice beach, worth to go. Will go again. Was great for time lapse video and beach walk. Enjoyed my time there with sunset. "
HayleyPresling,"Wellington, New Zealand",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful setting on Bali‚Äôs coastline. But sadly there is a lot of rubbish left behind which impacts the beauty. Be weary of the people trying to give you cards for timeshares and trying to get you to go to the hotels with them to claim prizes. This got annoying as there are so many people doing the same thing and some are quite pushy. We walked along the beach once but didn‚Äôt return again.
Ciggie123,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,We are staying right on the beach which is lovely just to look at but too rough for swimming most days.  Sand is awful 
Margaret B,"Calgary, Canada",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"At first glance upon arrival walking the beaches from Seminyak to Legian and Kuta and back my reaction was ‚Äúare you kidding me‚Äù. The words that comes to mind were SAD, PATHETIC, A TRAGEDY! In our travels, this is the filthiest beach we ever visited. There were a number of surfers taking lessons and others swimming. If I had children there is no way I would allow them to swim in those waters.  The first couple weeks the beaches were much the same, some days much worse than others. There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions. Sometimes we can be too quick to judge a place. Sadly for some we met, they only had a few days or a week to visit it at it‚Äôs worse."
paul,10 contributions,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Easy access. Lots of seating at bars and restos. Nice for family visits.  Not too noisy and lots of different price offering. 
WarneAu,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,Nice place to spend an evening with good restaurants to choose from and  listen to live music. Clean beach area. Don‚Äôt know how safe to swim. 
Brage N,9 contributions,Feb 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Granted, the weather was bad, but the beach wasn't great.  The sand is dark brown and there are some stray dogs there."
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Visited during my long walk along the coastal beaches of Kuta area. This beach was a bit cleaner than the previous ones but still had plenty of plastic around. Nice area and plenty of places to view sunset in the afternoon.
Leslie L,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Solo,The amount of plastic washed up on shore is horrific. Apparently Indonesia is second only to China for plastic pollution in our oceans. Such a shame.
CharisseThompson,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"It‚Äôs always refreshing to be at the beach. Great surfing waves, clear water, and warm sand between your toes."
Selena D,"Manchester, UK",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Every morning the locals clean this beach before the tourists get there because it is full off pollutions that comes in from the ocean. It‚Äôs a nice enough beach (after the clean up) but there are better beaches such as Echo beach and Nusa Beach. This beach is perfect for watching the sunset though!
davolitribe,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"So much rubbish floating in the water........water is beautiful and warm and the atmosphere great, but it's all let down by the floating rubbish and debris in the ocean. Something needs to be done......"
Noelene G,"Epping, Australia",Jan 2019,Nice sunset......but beach was full of rubbish.  Was not nice seeing a man drown and all the tourist just taking pictures.
John and Les C,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We were in Seminyak in early/mid January 2019 and saw some great sunsets.  Nice to walk along the beach during the day and visit Ku Da Ta and Potatoe Head.
Sammiwat,"Haltwhistle, UK",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Wow what an amazing huge beach which goes on forever. You'll certainly not feel overcrowded on this beach! Great for surfing to & lots of bars & restaurants nearby. It was a shame to see lots of plastic lying around on it but there was people there every day trying to pick it up, such a shame our world has let this happen, well done for trying to keep on top of it."
Sue T,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,A great place to sit with a glass of wine to watch the beautiful sunset.  Lots of locals will come up and try to sell their wares but they are making a living so I didn‚Äôt find it a problem. Lots of bats on the beach to buy beer. We brought our own wine.
Alexey Ivanov,"Moscow, Russia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Been here many times, great sunset many nice cafes along the beach, great place for cocktails and meet up with friends"
Marynik2,"Bathurst, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We went for a walk along the beach and it was considerably cleaner than other Bali beaches( Sanur, legion, kuta)I would probably go for a swim too as the water wasn‚Äôt washing up piles of plastic! The beach out the more expensive resorts( legian , oberoi) was pretty much spotless and we only encountered less than half a dozen hawkers along the way. Obviously they pay to keep them at bay. "
Bettina W,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,We spent one night in Seminyak and went to check the beach in the morning... we were very disappointed! The water is so dirty that we did not go in...there are great hotels on the beach and waves for surfers but unfortunately the water is dirty and the beach is not that great. There are many better options in Bali
Karen G,Tauranga,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"What a shame that what could be a great beach is filthy. Rubbish everywhere and the main entry smell disgusting. The beach is long and pretty is it went for this. Tourist will be more and more turned of visiting if the local population don't start to take a pride in where they live.  There was no one renting sun loungers, why would you to look at rubbishing washing in and out on the beach. There were a lot of surfers so I assume that's the main draw, however there are red flags lining most of the beach indicating rips and unsafe swimming areas. We only visited once preferring to swim in our villa pool instead."
CapeTurning,"Iisalmi, Finland",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"(written after 1st day, update after that)After starting our Bali trip in Sanur, where the beach was clean, with zero plastic and crystal, still waters, the Seminyak beach DUMP was a shocking experience!A very nice, classic monumental beach, tens of kilometres long, and more than 50 m wide, with this solid, easy-walking sand, BUT FULL OF PLASTIC! Both the beach and the water as well. And small rivers bring sewage, nauseous.Could not swim at all, so ugly! Fortunately we had such a nice villa, we could stay there.About this disaster we discussed for long with our villa manager. Well, he said that the beach is not such all the time, but twice a year. Then there is certain wind, that now started blowin 4 days ago, and it brings a lot of wood pieces and plastic ashore.Usually lasts around a week. Good thing to see, compared to eg. Thailand, was to see, that there was an army of government paid workers cleaning beach, and trucks driving the waste away. On our 1 hour walk I think we saw more than hundred workers on a 2km strip of beach.Still, it will last days for the sea to vommit all the carbage to the land for them to pick up.I asked where is the litter from, and the manager told us, it is from ther rivers, namely Balis own rivers, not coming further away. He said there is a lot going on in Bali to tackle the issue, but the change is slow, and presumed it take at least one lifetime. They do realize that tourists won't come if it is not clean!And, maybe tourists have already started to shun Bali as both in Sanur and in Seminyak it was really quite, the restaurants empty all night etc.?They are banning the plastic straws already, which is a start, but most of the plastic litter seems to be smaller than plastic bags, these everyday wrappers for food. Why do we need to wrap a single sweet into plastic?(updated after the second last day)Well, during the last day, the beach seemed cleaner, the armies of cleaners had succeeded and it seemed less new trash coming. However, when standing in the sea knee deep, almost every wave brouht ugly things to skin...(updated after the last day)The situation got even better, less crap. A New Hope!#hopingforthebetterworld #stoptheplasticpollution"

Stephan S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Visited here x2 during our stay, sun loungers readily available and the accompanying service cannot be faulted, you run a bit of a gauntlet as you arrive ( multiple vendors asking you to stay on ‚Äútheir ‚Äú loungers‚Äù when walking was disappointing to see the amount of plastic still even though there has been a push to reduce usage of plastic bags."
Barry M,Siem Reap,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"We‚Äôre here for a week and wishing we‚Äôd researched more thoroughly before booking a villaThe beach is a tip. It‚Äôs strewn with litter, especially plastic. Some hotels make a half hearted effort to clean up the patch outside their property but it‚Äôs token. We took some pics outside the Oberoi, Legian, Ku de Ta. Judge for yourself Worse from a health point of view is the stinking effluent that drains across the beach in several places. A beach stroll means having to walk or wade through untreated sewage.And people actually swim and lay down among this sh:t. Yuk. "
Rian L,15 contributions,Jan 2019,We spent the day at the beach and what a nice place not to crowded and very pleasant. Water was very enjoyable and will definitely go there again.
CiaraG,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak Beach is a good place to see the sunset, but cannot particularly recommend it for tourists during the day. The beach is full of piles of rubbish, & there is (as pictured below) rubbish in the ocean & washing up on the foreshore. Definitely wouldn't recommend for swimming, or water activities of any kind! If you're looking for swimming beach, head down to Nusa Dua üèñÔ∏è It can be nice to walk along the beach (if you're that kind of person), & there was a swing set up down there during our visit (Dec 18) for tourists to take pictures with. There are a good number of beach bars around with pools, however these get unbelievably busy & we couldn't even find a place to be served. Overall, a good place to see the sunset, but I'd give the typical beach activities a miss! üåá"
Bhavicp,"Fiumicino, Italy",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Decently clean beach and quite big. Sand is very very soft (black sand)Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach with pretty good prices for drinks and food.  Around 100k for a cocktail and 80k for chicken Nachos- sitting on the beach on bean bags and live music at night. Didn't seem to be any bugs either, even at 9pm. Must go here for a lovely sunset experience  "
wendy c,barcelona,Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We stayed in Seminyak for 2 weeks during Christmas and New Year. We‚Äôve been coming to Bali for 24 years but always staying in Bali Hyatt in Sanur then to Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua. This time though, we decided to rent a villa in Seminyak, 5 minutes walk from Ku De Ta.On our first day, I ran on the beach. It was DISGUSTING! I saw dogs pooing on the beach, pile  of rubbish so high I thought from afar that  they are piling it for new year‚Äôs bonfire until I got close to it and it was a pile of rubbish. I ran for 5 km and it was just horrifying.  I‚Äôve never seen this part of Bali and I feel so sad that such beach condition exists.Also the pack of dogs that are present along the beach can be very intimidating and very aggressive. Parents especially with small children, Beware!"
haqsta,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Please see review of Double Six Beach where essentially say beach is wide and great for walking yet feels a bit dirty with the occasional whiff of sewage. That said (!) it is a very nice walk past all the beach bars at sunset from Double Six right up to La Lucciola The W, Alila and all the great Beach bars around that part. Quite a social walking vibe at sunset"
Teo,Petaling Jaya,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Be sure to come here when you are in Seminyak. It is just within walking distance or you can ride a bike to here. The sunset is picturesque. 
wayne j,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,Last time we were in Seminyak was in 2008 and what a difference ten years make! Could not believe the amount of rubbish on the beach and also what was coming in on the tide! Go for a surf or swim here? No way! Stop consuming people and take care of your rubbish!
Luciana M,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"I was very disapointed! It was the First place I visited in Bali, the beach is dirty, there is garbage everywhere. The beach is not beautiful, I stayed 4 nights in Seminyak, I wouldnt stay there again, I would go to Canggu or Uluwatu in instead"

Vincent L,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"They  do spend a lot of time and money cleaning up  the plastic,driftwood  and other  debris every low tide. Seeing  all the debris debris every morning I can't imagine it being very inviting for swimmers. Fortunately the resorts along the beach have pools."
Jazy1,"London, UK",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"I found the beach unclean.  I‚Äôm use to white sands the whole nine yards.  I can‚Äôt compare it to the Caribbean of course. I do think there needs to be more effort to maintain it.  Definitely the most expensive beach I have been to just to hire a beach chair, more so than Jamaica negril believe it or not. Roughly ¬£12 for less than 4 hours. Ludicrous."
Daisy C,"Penryn, UK",Jan 2019,A nice beach for a walk or to watch the sunset. Plenty of sun beds to rent and beach clubs to visit.

Deanne D,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nice beach. Be careful where you walk though as there is a large amount of plastic getting washed up onto the beach. This is very sad as apart from that it is very pretty. You can walk along the beach for a long way. There are touts selling all sorts of things on the beach too. Be sure to swim between the flags as there are dangerous bits.
"Theo Botha-chef,restauranteur,hotelier",301 contributions,Jan 2019 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Nice beach to learn how to surf.Its a natural black sand or volcanic sand beach.Problem is,there is just so much rubbish all over the beach.It really spoils the feel and natural beauty of the shoreline .You can rent a surfboard for 50k for 1 hour .more expensive than eco beach where you can get it for 2 hours.Rent sun-beds  for 100k an hour.Loads of bars on the beach to have a cocktail or beer.Kids loved it there.The local ladies sell their chicken skewers on the street.you have to try them.delicious!"

grey_hare63,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"I've been to Seminyak beach over the past few years and it has always been reasonably clean. But in my latest trip it was in a horrific condition with plastic and rubbish strewn across the entire beach for as far as I could see.  We went into the water and were surrounded by thousands of pieces of plastic wrappers and other rubbish!  It was brushing against our arms, legs and body! I wonder if this is a seasonal problem or permanent problem?  If the latter, then this will be the end of Seminyak beach as we know it... a very sad state of affairs."
Vicki W,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We went their yesterday and the thing thst hit me straight away was the rubbish. It is disgusting. I was horrified. How can a beach like this be so iconic. I walked Into the water to my ankles and got hit with rubbish and walked straight out again. I am not interested in swimming with a heap of trash.We were at the far end and I thought may be it gets better further down. Nope it gets way worse. There are literally piles (like 20 feet high) of rubbish on the beach. Not just one pile but several. Are they relying on people being too drunk to notice that this beach is a rubbish dump.This is disgraceful. There were a few tourist (me being one of them) cleaning up the rubbish on the beach. That is not my idea of a day at the beach. Get your act together Bali if you want tourists to continue coming. 
Mintra,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This beach is disgustingly dirty. I stayed in seminyak for 5 days (first time in Bali) just walking distance to the beach and was extremely disappointed. It‚Äôs a combination of people littering as well as the sewage or river water getting dumped right onto this beach. Had to walk on the sand with shoes on and when I decided to put my feet in the water I was splashed with trash and rocks. Pick a different beach to go to like Ulu Watu, much cleaner. "
Pepperpot,"San Cayetano, Spain",Dec 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beach is not nice it‚Äôs full of rubbish that they try to clean every day by hand and one digger. The waves are massive only fit for surfing. Going in the ea your legs get wrapped up in plastic bags and othe washed up rubbish

Elin N,"Oslo, Norway",Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"The beach itself is sandy, fine and miles long. Not very suitable for swimming. Perfect for new surfers and bodyboards.A sunset beach - late afternoon restaurants and bars along the shore, makes the beach into a bar-street.Be aware of the tide ! Some places plastic and other garbage can drift in to the beach, due to current, wind and tide. Please bring a bag to help Seminyak a clean beach. Some of the sunbed owners often help to clean themselves üëç Possible to snorkle some places very close to shore. In all a superb beach, even if it is difficult to swim there.  "

SeanIFN,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Good location for people who likes nature and would like a romantic walk with their significant half. Also great place for a swim and surfing although there are better beaches for this purpose.
Gwendoll,"Pitt Meadows, Canada",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"My first impression of Seminyak beach was simply: ""wow"".We went on a day that would be classified as an overcast but yet the beach was filled with people. Luckily the beach stretched on for miles on either side so there was plenty of room for everyone. I did not rent a lounger as I only planned on staying for a couple of hours but upon talking to the locals they were very friendly and the rates were reasonable to rent loungers.The sand on this beach is like no other, it is so soft yet sticks to your skin like paste. The beach was very clean and the water very refreshing. It was fun to watch surfers try to catch a wave."
Alexandra C,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Marvellous beach, dark sand, amazing mood. We went to a beach bar who had coloured umbrellas with lights that offered a whimsical surrounding. I felt safe also. People are very friendly."
Sylvia K,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Visited the beach after my visit to Petitenget Temple as it is just across the carpark from it.The beach reminded me of my uni days when I visited Mandura, Australia during summer.The sand is black and fine and hence, when you attempt to walk along the beach, it is advisable to walk bear footed.  It is rather safe to do so.If you intend to swim, you have to do so in the safe zone (between the flags).  The waves are crashing and therapeutic."
mariaom1523,"Birr, Ireland",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"An amazing beach which stretches for miles.

Annie K,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Dropped off at the beach by courtesy vehicle attached to our Seminyak accommodation. There were pay for toilets nearby however  no changing sheds apparent.  Eventually I paid an attendant  for a toilet and changed in that.  Felt that a beach of this size and popularity  should have free  well signed changing  areas located at intervals along the beach front for beach goers to use.  Also ""Surfers Only""  signage was clearly  apparent on the sand along the beach and indicated to me as a visitor and  other beach goers  that there were no actual  areas that that the swimmers could go without sharing the water space with those surfing.  .  This is in fact  a safety hazard and appeared to be the case along  the entire  length of the  Seminyak beach where the surf is rolling in.  In the end - unable to find an area free of surfers and surf boards  we ended up just  dipping in the shallow areas and   swimming in an area that was utilized by a few surfers and then out of nowhere  a group  arrived  with instructors who were all   learning to surf because no areas had been cordoned off for just swimmers.    Not happy about this as an accident could have easily happened and we felt restricted in this beach/water situation."
Stockholmer_67,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This is not the Maldives or the Caribbean. One does not go here to swim in the sea, but it is great for surfers."
Trek802064,14 contributions,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Views of the sun setting in the horizon was magnificent to experience.  Coupled with the atmosphere with crowds of people flocking the beach locals and tourists alike. All across the beach You See stretches of bars, restaurants and cafe, with outdoor settings.  At night time the beach lights up with live bands and music catered for most senses.   Disappointing to see plastic and rubbish littered across the sands though. Effluent from nearby streams are washed out to see so stay away from these areas.  Other than that, youll have local hawkers looking for a sale. If you catch there eye they will hone into you and haggle you to buy their products.  Not just one but a flock of hawkers will surrounding your location causing frustation and potentially ruining your peaceful place. I learnt to say ""no thank you"" in Indonesian - tidak terima kasih which they acknowledge more than saying it in English. Try it and see. "
Margaret O,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Worth a visit, I wandered from my hotel and explored the beach I was just having a quick look so I did not rent a sunbed. I did have a lovely young coconut to quench my thirst. As soon as I sat down I had ladies approaching me to buy their wares. I thought it a good time to buy some gifts for fellow work colleagues. I got a quick massage which I think I paid too much for. As I walked along the beach I could see people horse riding, having surfing lessons, and many colourful beach bars. I was at the beach mid morning. Worth a visit.   "
KwH819,"Northamptonshire, UK",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"This beach is fabulous with very colourful beach bars.Always wear flip flops though as the sand gets ridiculously hot!The tip i would give is stick to where the Air Asia umbrellas and loungers are. All the beach bars there have toilets.Passed that it is cooler and hipper but the beach bars don‚Äôt have toilets and the public ones are closed!Lovely chilled atmosphere with beanbag at the bars, which has no charge unlike the loungers. Just have to drink and/or eat."
LavishLady,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Beautiful beach that stretches for miles and becomes very colourful as the sunsets with a hedonistic crowd and beautiful bean bags and umbrellas. The sand is yellow and the waters are a dark blue which can be wavy and rough but still very pleasant and great for surfers. I had three people massaging me on the beach for a few pounds it was amazing!! Lots of beach vendors but they actually had some lovely jewellery and art work and they are not forceful at all. Enjoy very much it‚Äôs the life :)
msizemore88,"San Antonio, TX",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beach is great clean from debris and trash...waves are great. Good for surf or swim. We had a great time
corgi47,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Seminyak's vibe is hipper and cooler than Legian, and in particular, Kuta. It's very chilled and relaxed. The beach clubs are all pretty good, if not a bit same-same. The beach is lovely but the sand is darker than expected. Sunsets are amazing."
Sonica2012,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,We went to beach around sunset and must say the view is to die for. the sand is so good on the feat and pictures came out just perfect. the beach is quite clean and hav resturants to chill
PETER K,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Seminyak Beach is like any other, nothing special but a nice long walk in the early morning is great."
joycewalesengland,WALES ENGLAND,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,nice beach but the waves were high and we had a red flag each day You have to barter for the price of the chairs as we got it cheaper the second time we went
Kimboc34,"Neath, UK",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Enjoyed our days by the beach watching the surfers tackling sometimes crazy waves... beach is very clean & the beach sellers very friendly & accept it when you do not wish to be bothered. Make sure you negotiate your price for sun beds & umbrella.At sunset grab a beanbag & a Bintang & watch the sun go down, absolutely amazing & well worth doing..... "
Brent K,16 contributions,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"It wasn't a clean beach at all. Water from waste pipes were running straight into the sea. It smelled like the drains if Seminyak in most parts. Worst of all, used plastics (and condoms unfortunately!) were to be seen on the water edge. If it wasn't for the muck, this would be a fantastic beach. Sunset was gorgeous but we won't be back."
Christine S,"Seoul, South Korea",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"My expectations were low due to several reviews of the beach being unclean, but I found it very clean. Didn‚Äôt swim in it though. Nice to walk along."
priti sahay,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"While Bali has various wonderful beaches, we felt Seminyak beach offered a perfect blend of beauty and fun. There were so many nice restaurants with romantic ambience, good music and good food. There were bean bags on the beach and you can spend hours looking g at the ocean. It gave such a surreal feeling. There are good places to shop also around the beach. Our best evening in Bali was on the Seminyak Beach without a doubt. "
Taylor H,"Gilbert, AZ",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak Beach is beautiful to look at, especially at sunrise. However, waves were very strong and difficult to swim in. Plastic was littered throughout the beach, stray dogs were everywhere doing their business, and it constantly smells like an outhouse. There are much better beaches in the world to visit. I guess Bali doesn‚Äôt have them. It‚Äôs too bad they don‚Äôt care more about their environment. "
JohnPaul78,"Swindon, UK",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Went here from the hotel was told it wasn't far so decided to walk rather than take a taxi. It was about 40 mins so not too bad.Beach is lovely but it was quite rough as the red flags were flying. But we enjoyed our stroll up and back in and out of the water. 
Sonia G,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Surf spot during the day yes but it‚Äôs a Great place to watch the sunset and have a drink!must be visited !
Ozmurt,"Warrnambool, Australia",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Very hot and very dirty, only positive no hawker but no shelter unless your at a motel. Try another location. "
Brandon C,15 contributions,Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Bali is amazing. I would definitely recommend anyone to travel there. The people and the food are wonderful.  The price is very affordable too.
V3AS,"Kanpur, India",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"I loved staying at the Seminyak Beach area. The beach is clean, the shopping  is interesting & the pubs are very lively. The place has loads of resturants serving mostly all international cuisines. "
Ghumakad Geetika,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,The beach has a beautiful horizon sunset. The waves in morn us very strong. Not recommended for swimming.  For surfers excellent beach
Henwoods24,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Busy, rather dirty, full of umbrellas, and far too many people and motorbikes. It was exactly as we expected, as we have travelled throughout Asia before, but certainly don‚Äôt visit Seminyak expecting a great beach. "
Elmo3168,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,"Nice sunset view at this location. Great for a visit. There are many restaurants along the beach , great for enjoyment"
CharlotteKirsch,"Reading, UK",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,This isn‚Äôt the most idillic beach you‚Äôll ever see during the day. Just like most others and nothing special but during sunset it tops all other locations! Absolutely amazing. Sitting on the beanbags on the beach is just incredible to watch the sunset. 
marga,"Tenerife, Spain",Oct 2018,I spent two night in Seminyak close to the beach...If you are here you have to see sunset on the beach It‚Äôs really wonderful and you can see perfect 
glowworm27,Scotland,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We were a bit disappointed by this beach as there's a lack of sunbeds or outlets. The water is also really choppy so not recommended for swimming as there's often red flags up. Legian or Canggu are better for chilling.
Rob L,13 contributions,Oct 2018,Awesome beach with really helpful locals ensuring that if it is pampering you are after then you are in the right place . If you want to surf then you are in the right place also. Win win. 
djula1991,"Beijing, China",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach is clean and there are lots of waves for surfers. Surfboard rental is also available. Overall good for afternoon relaxing 
Sylvia DrSoul Fernandez,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"This is a great beach for walking and jogging for it has sturdy sand and it has a lot of space! The small waves don‚Äôt seem good for swimming but ok for just having a dip in the water when you get too hot. Many nice shells to pick and many Beach chairs to pay for, restaurants and amazing sunsets!!"
CSJFR,"Ronse, Belgium",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,I have no idea anymore wich beaches we have fine but we stayed in Seminyak and we did every beach. They are all a bit different but all good. We loved Manu beach house.
Pamela K,"Boston, MA",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo, Highly recommended- great beach without the crowds.  Waves and tides can be very strong though so stay aware. 
Wael D,4 contributions,Jul 2018,"This side of Bali Island is well known for Kite Surfing and Surfing generally due to high waves and strong wind.The Water is not clear and the sands are dark ""more like Mud""."
Westade75,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Probaly would want to be a competant swimmer before you took a dip... Also make sure your injection and imunisations are up to date as the water looks pretty dirty...Not as hectik as Kuta though.. Not as many hawkers harrsssing you to buy junk either. 
ronster68,"London, UK",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A great beach which is perfect for long walks or even runs.The times I visited the sea was perfect fir surfers due to the waves and probably not too good fir swimmers.This is a very popular beach for people to watch the sunset and wow they are amazing.There are a number of bars and hotels to choose from should you wish to sit and have a drink while the sun goes down.It gets very busy. 
A7079CEjanes,"Worcestershire, UK",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This is great beach but its mainly used by surfers as the waves are large.  All the time we were there, its seemed to be kept clean.There are lots of great bars to watch the sunset, the only downside was the hawkers trying to sell you stuff. A few of them would not take no for an answer.   I managed to go horse riding and its a great beach for this, its long and wide with lots of room."
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Nice beach bars and restaurants along the beachNice place for dinner while watching sunset.Not as rowdy and dirty as Kuta beach and Legin beach
Scozziegirl,"Bassendean, Australia",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We walked here from our hotel for our first look at the beach in Bali. The seas were high and the beach was quiet so we had a easy walk from Ku DeTa up to Petinget beach and back. 
rolandlinda1,"Atenas, Costa Rica",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This is a really beautiful beach, but waters are rough with big waves.  Consequently this beach attracts mostly surfers.  They do have nice lounger chairs that you can rent and people watch.  "
Escape683290,3 contributions,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Sat at Franks Bar on the beach had many bintangs...dinner next door at beach hut to watch the sunset What a wonderful experience met many new friends....
lynneandcarl,"Raumati Beach, New Zealand",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We went for walk along the beach. Grey sand, heavy seas for this time of year but clean. No shells. Not worthy for return. Great view at a distance."
Vinay S,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak might comparatively be a quieter option among the ones you have on the stretch that includes Kuta and Double Six, but it can still get pretty crowded. Reason for that could be the fact that it has fantastic waves for those who seek to surf, and lets you enjoy one of the most majestic sunsets in the region. With an array of bars and restaurants facing the sea, you get enough and more places to just sit on a beanbag, gulp your beer with delicious starters, and enjoy the sunset. But with all those people and each restaurant playing their music, it can get a bit buzzy."
Amo572016,"Margaret River, Australia",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We went to view the sunset on our last evening in Bali, and it didn't disappoint.Lots of people but it didn't feel crowded at all. "
Bridget R,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,It has the most amazing sunsets and best place to have a drink and some food on the beach whilst listening to music. Later in the night either a dj will play or live band !! 
Irene A,5 contributions,Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We stayed near the Double six beach, the beach is pretty clean compared to Kuta. The best is when you swim at the indian ocean while watching the sunset. And of course coconut water."
Ssmmiejay,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Seminyak Beach in the dry season is very clean.  Compared to when I went in January when there was rubbish all over the beach, this time I went there was none!  Make the effort to go down there before sunset and pull up an beanbag to soak up the sun, beer and sunset.  I even saw lots of people swimming!"
tonysyd274,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2018,On our last trip 3 years ago we remembered the beach and ocean being really dirty. Now it‚Äôs looking great and a beach you can happily grab that surf lesson or sit an watch an incredible sunset at one of the bars 
sab93924,"Warrington, UK",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"I wish I had known that it would cost to rent the sun beds every day as I would‚Äôve planned accordingly. Average price that people say is 200,000 but we haven‚Äôt paid above 100,000 for two. We have found that outside Capil Beach is the best spot as such and if you come later in the day the guy will give you a cheaper price than the rest! If you rent a sunbed you can use the toilet inside the restaurant as well. We also learnt to surf with these guys who are a right laugh and we both stood up first time There is lots of surfers and areas not suitable to swimmers along this section of the beach so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to weak swimmers or young childrenThere is heaps of plastic and rubbish along the length of the beach, very sad to see! We have spent time out of our day to clean up "
Alaksander,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"The beach is nice to walk on. the smooth white sand, nice sunsets and dotted with luxury resorts. However at the end of the beach before Legian beach or Double six, there is a smelly sewage that is hard to cross. We had to walk back.."
Swarnima V,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Perfect place to enjoy the sun, sand and the weather. We went in the evening, it was a 10 minute walk from our hotel- had a nice long stroll by the beach. It‚Äôs very clean and well kept  Sunset at the beach is a must watch for all visitors of Bali ... shacks here are nice ! U can try la plancha food and music !! "
Steve T,"Midland, Australia",May 2018,We from West Australia go up here and always ask why don't they clean the beach? the views are breathtaking and people are nice just needs a government to get in with the right equipment and clean the beach every day and not dump rubbish in the ocean. Why they don't look at fixing this has been the question fro 20 years.
Andhika K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"As a local tourist,Bali is my fav place to escape from the hectic life of Jakarta, so I prefer to stay near the beach and not in rush to visit many places. Seminyak beach is my fav to spend the time and enjoy the sunset. It has magical view to see when the Sun sets with the red and golden sky.."
Neil3333,"Yeovil, UK",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Great for surfers, not good for swimmers. We found the beach to be very polluted! walks on the beach included stepping over dirty nappies! not the idillic beach it could be"
keys4321,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Not overly crowded, beautiful beachfront, clean, all in all a great place to hangout with friends or just alone..."
Katia K,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"One of the most beautiful sunsets you can see in Bali is on the Seminyak beach. And if you like to enjoy sunset with a cocktail in your hand, there are plenty of bars with comfy bean bags. The atmosphere is great here! Although very crowded as this is a popular spot in Bali, so be prepared and come a bit earlier It can be nice during the day as well, not a typical ‚Äúwhite sand blue water‚Äù kind of beach - but you can practice surf or have lunch while watching huge waves."
Slldcl,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak beach is clean, safe,  water clear and warm. Sand is darker than the white sands of Australia. Lots of restaurants are lined along the beaches, many with bands or music playing. Very family friendly, not too many hustlers."
radwas473,"Princeton, NJ",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids visiting from the USA. We loved this beautiful sandy beach. Walking distance to everything. Great waves. We had a blast!
ngj4,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Family with 2.5yo toddler. It's ok for lounging around but not that good for children. Parts of beach close to fancy hotels are manicured otherwise rubbish in others. 
Debbie R,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Perhaps we are a bit spoilt but we found this beach a bit disappointing with harsh black sand and lots of people.
DrNitinPuri,"Jalandhar, India",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Its a average beach with lots of pubs/restuarants on it. Beauty of sea is like any other beach. Sandy beach where some time can be spend
p4pranjal,"Surat, India",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,This beach is a nice place to relax. White sand and a great sunset to watch. The water current is high so it is not advisable to go for swimming. I saw 3 people drowned in the sea. but there are life guards who saved them. Take care of kids and not let them go un attended in the sea. Overall a good place. 
Raag7,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful and clean beach. Good place for surf . Lots of bars good beer and cocktails vibrant beach umbrellas.
amtraveller_50,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Grab a bean bag and enjoy the sunset! A relaxed beach. Perfect for walking along. Great surf and lots of places to eat and drink.
Adelaide_Cat,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A beautiful but busy beach with lots of great beach bars offering a nice relaxed vibe for some sunset beers and cocktails.
JonNewport,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,I have been coming to Bali for 35 years and today the beach was the cleanest I have ever seen. We walked from the temple near Laluciola to Jl Melasti and the beach was very clean. Congratulations to the beach staff for a job well done.Terima Kasih
JennyWilson0403,12 contributions,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak beach was ok, nothing great, and there was a fair amount of rubbish on the beach. They tried to cover it out by taking it out with a tractor I think, but as the day wore on it just all came to the surface of the beach. There are loads of nice beach bars and restaurants all the front, where it was nice just to relax, have a few drinks and some food."
Princess Leia,"Pyeongtaek, South Korea",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Seminyak has a lot of Bars and restaurant along the beach and its nice to just hang around and relax ... Clean and good for Surfing too ...
Alaa Gamaleldin,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good option Enjoy the nice views during sunset Suitable for coming early or at sunset Sandy nice beach area 
luisa25,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,This was my third time to this part of Bali and the cleanest the beaches have ever been! So nice not to dodge rubbish on our morning strolls.
Emma H,"Birmingham, UK",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,This is a very busy beach with bars and restaurants all along the front with great menus. Although it‚Äôs busy it has a buzz and plenty of beds to hire. The sunsets here are also beautiful.
drshefalijanak,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We stayed at The Oberoi ... which is right at the Seminyak beach... clean, nice beach... watching sunset was so beautiful and serene! Kude ta and The Potato Head are the highlights on the beach!!"
Jimmy N,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Take the time to stroll around the village after being on the beach. Some good eating places there‚Ä¶Loved the Greek restaurant on the main drag..
Carla F,30 contributions,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We had never seen waves like we have in Bali. We liked the beach was lovely to have a walk along and watch the surfers.
Brooke E,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak beach is a typical tourist beach which it slightly quieter than Kuta. We happily spent the day there renting sunbeds, and checking out the bars along the beach, definitely caters for all budgets. The beach can get extremely busy at times especially around sunset time. The sunsets were beautiful. As mentioned in pervious posts rubbish can be an issue. "
stephenbH4999ZR,"Australind, Australia",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Love this beach great surf, great people, great food. If you just want to sit & watch the world go by this is the place then top it off with an awesome sunset, you just won‚Äôt go wrong!"
Noel H,4 contributions,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very nice sunsets.....great people and food..beach very nice for families and surfers......very close to hotel...so walking was easy..
G8814TXandrew,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We found the beach to be dirty, & not an enjoyable experience, beaches outside resorts appear to be tidier"
Ankita A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Centrally located in bali, this beach is ok if you'd like to watch the sunset. However, it is quite crowded (mostly with Australians holidaying) and you would not be able to spend much time in water since seabed is really grainy. I even got grazed by a couple of pretty big stones while in water.One advantage is that it is situated right opposite Ku De Ta beach club so you can swim/ relax/ watch sunset/ drink/ eat all in a couple of hours."
Ccordo1,Montreal,Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Long coastline to walk along. Some areas have more waves than others. Unfortunately there is a bit of plastic litter as well.Lots of people, but you can find some quieter zones.You can easily find chairs and parasols to rent.Restaurants are nearby."
Ingrid T,12 contributions,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great beach to sit and soak up the rays and atmosphere or watch the kite flying and people watch. Close to the shopping centre and great eateries. Good walk along beach to Double Six Beach or even further to Kuta Beach. 
John G,72 contributions,Aug 2018,"The beach itself is great, especially if after some waves....but it really needs looking after...I picked up broken glass on 2 occasions, and the amount of plastic waste coming on shore is a very sorry sight ...apart from myself and one family I saw picking the litter, I see no other effort generally...It‚Äôs all of us‚Äô problem and we need to take collective responsibility for it :-)"
Nigel M,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A massive beach that gives you the best of everything. Areas around the bars tend to be busy but walk along the beach and you will find quieter areas. The beach was clean and the waves were good without being dangerous
Tomas141,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Very clean beach with good long views and nice fine sand. Swimming not really possible as it‚Äôs too rough and has strong rips. You can splash around in the waves though. 
Sanjeev Ohri,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,spent a good time here with my child who is 5 years and he played so much with the sand. outlets are good and beach is very clean. no matter how much you play with the sand you never get it home as sand doesn't stick for long
adm12017,"London, UK",Aug 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"This is really quite a nice place to visit. I'd recommend getting here an hour before sunset, finding some bean bags at one of the beach bars and ordering some drinks and appetisers to watch the sunset.It's a nice vibe and most of the bars are either playing Balearic beats or have live acoustic musicians going on.It does get busy, but it's nicely chilled out and an enjoyable way to watch the sunset.There are lots of vendors walking past trying to sell you trinkets, but they aren't pushy and a gentle wave off sends them on to someone else.Plenty of places around for food and drink too."
Roger J,34 contributions,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Very very busy and vibe is great...lots to see and do. Try to stay close to the beach so that you can walk to the beach. Lots of cool bars along the beach.
David B,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"I didn‚Äôt find much to enjoy at Seminyak Beach. Murky water, rubbish everywhere and crowds of people wandering around taking pictures of said water and rubbish.There‚Äôs a few beach clubs along the way which serve food and drinks to you while you sit on bean bags facing the water. Might be better if the view was good."
6419,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Nice clean beach, many options for light lunch and a beer on the beach. The restaurants have clean toilets, so a family day out is good. You can bargain for the sun beds and even book by the hr so don‚Äôt pay the initial asking price.Life guard on duty, watch out as the sea has a strong current."
Magdalena K,"Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"If you‚Äôre surfing, but still learning how to catch a good wave, it might be interesting place for you. If you‚Äôre looking for white sand and crystal blue ocean, Seminyak won‚Äôt be amazing for you... nice for the sunset though."
Linda N,5 contributions,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Would be nicer if the hawkers left you alone .. they tend to hound you relentlessly .. maybe thats just part of Bali I dont enjoy
Richard S,"Leicester, UK",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Lovely sandy beach however, there are stray dogs that roam free along the beach and do their business on the sand so you do have to be careful where you're walking... The beach is packed at around 6pm when the sunsets but when we went for a walk down the beach around 6:30ish there is a marge amount of litter that people leave behind, tourists and local people seem to thing it's ok to leave the bottles and plastics lying around for the tide to come in and wash it all out to sea. That was the disappointing this as we were expecting a beautiful beach which is was until sunset, it was just a shame that people couldn't do their bit to help keep it tidy too..."
brancolyn,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"This is Seminyak, it is busy and there is lots to look at.  The beach is not beautiful, and we did not swim here, although others were surfing.  You can see that it has rips, so be careful.  Lots going on here, great place to grab a drink at one of the restaurant/bars and watch the sunset.  Black sand, and a little polluted."
Lligla,"Walcha, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,WE love being on Seminyak beach--waves are  huge so need to be careful and be sensible! It's great to walk along before breakfast or in evening. always quite a lot going on as well. Not so sure about the wet season though.
RobsterWirral,"Cheshire, UK",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Business,What a truly charming place. The people are so friendly. The bars are great the health food shops amazing. Highly recommended for all ages!!!
Sid,"Navi Mumbai, India",Jul 2018,"Not might impressed with this beach , too crowded and not very clean , especially if you visit the other beaches in Bali "
Laura199472,"England, UK",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The beach goes on forever, its very clean, the sea is warm and very wavey - too strong even for surfing throughout our visit. With very strong currants also.Price of sunbeds vary along the beach, and there are not many places to get onto the beach from the road.The beach isn't crowded in terms of people sitting on it, but there are always hundreds of people walking along the beach. "
Around the World,"Vienna, Austria",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,This part of a long strip isn‚Äôt so developed even the beach road is full of branded shops nobody needs. We came across of one of the beach clubs and had a break for a drink. There are only tourists sitting with a smartphone and taking selfies and staring on it. Creepy & funny at the same time. They pay a lot of money to fly thousands of miles and end up in one of the beach club with their smartphones. I feel it‚Äôs so boring and after the drink we left. So Seminyak beach is more for overdressed tourists which forget to shop at home or believe that branded stuff is cheaper here. And along the beach is like a canal. Very smelly and not nice. 
_richnolivia,"Wairarapa, New Zealand",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Seminal beach is very clean.  The people that sell goodies on the beach are Lovely they take no for an answer.Visit Sally or Kites they will make up brackets and necklaces to suit you.Security guards are very friend along with Balinese people always smiling.BEAUTIFUL sunsets to see. 
Colincfc,"Maidstone, UK",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Loungers on beach pretty expensive 300000 for 5 hours prepare to haggle as they start around 600000, turtle came ashore near us which made our day prepare to be hassled all day by sellers generally the same ones you told 5 mins previous,  "
Teresa M,16 contributions,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We really enjoyed the beach at the Ku De Ta end and really loved Ku De Ta and the facilities. Would definitely go back.
Logan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Clean beach . Beside kuta square. Alot of dining areas. Beach activities.. good waves for surfing . You are able to rent a surf board
rahulladhad,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,A nicw beach. Unless nusa Dua beach which is white sand beach this beach is a black sand beach. A great place to learn surfing and located near to market area. Best time to visit is early morning by 8:30.
srmurray2015,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Lovely beach lots of lounges for hire. Plenty of great little bars for Lowe cost eats and  drinks . Becareful in the surf it gets very big and rough . Nice spot to watch the sunset with a beer or cocktail 
Brian A,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great place to get away from the bustle have a cold beer and watch the sunset. Not too crowded compared to Kuta. Lots of places to get cold drinks good prices and many types of food available also good prices. Easy enough to walk to the beach from many hotels or a cheap taxi ride.
Sunny C,"Sunbury, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Beautiful sunsets with friendly locals.We stayed at the Breezes Resort & Spa which was in short walking distance to Seminyak Beach.  The beach is lovely to walk along, but I wasn't enticed to swim.  My husband ticked off his bucket list item to learn surfing.You can hire a shaded deck chair for 50,000IDR - depending on your negotiating skills this could be for a couple of hours or a whole day (depending on demand as well!)Great beach for long walks as you can stop for refreshment at plenty of places along the way."
Dhugh70,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,The beach is great for walking along. It us windy which makes it pleasant. I did venture in for a dip but I came out stinking. This may have something to do with sewage system near the beach. There are many hotel restaurants to stop and have a drink or meal.
kristadionis,"Gaborone, Botswana",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Business,"I have been coming to Bali on Business for years and one of the trip's highlights is the blissful moments where I can walk the Seminyak beach! Although the sand is not white but more volcanic black it is not as black as other beaches in Bali.  I enjoy the short motor bike ride to the beach where I park it. I then walk for about 45 minutes towards Batu Belig Beach where I dine at Warung Pantai, a superb and very reasonably priced beach restaurant. I enjoy the sunset there, usually order grilled Mahi Mahi with Salad and steamed rice or vegetables spring rolls, fresh squeezed lime juice, have a great cup of Bali Coffee before heading back by night towards Legian beach. At night there are very few people on the beach, it is cool and all the night lights of all the beach venues are so pretty.  The authorities/ residents have really cleaned up the beach a lot and this year I witnessed very little litter in spite of the fact that by day there are people in abundance. Walking the beach at different times you will see the hoards of sunbathers by day, resident expats walking their dogs, children playing, oldies walking, local balinese with their families, people making offerings, people doing yoga, brides and grooms having photo shoots on horseback or in the waves....you will see so much as you walk this beach.  Depending on the time of the day the sea will also have a different beauty...sometimes calm & blue, in the evening navy blue with golden  reflections of the sunset, all the spray of the rolling waves catching the beautiful sundown rays."
605jacintam,7 contributions,Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Seminyak beach along the Anantara stretch is quieter, less crowded. You can walk for miles with the waves just kissing your feet and the wind blowing. Not much bother here from people peddling their wares."
coralreef59,"Berkhamsted, UK",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak beach is probably one of the best I have ever seen. There is miles of golden sand and clear blue water.It seems to be quite popular for surf boarding and we saw people having lessons.There are quite a lot of beach clubs spread out along the beach all serving food and drinks. We ate and had drinks at a very relaxing beach club (the name escapes me) which was on 'potato head' beach. There were bean bags parasols, a small swimming pool with a children's area and a dining area. This place was so chilling, it was hard to leave.The sunsets on this beach are beautiful."
ferspratt,"Seattle, WA",May 2018,"Walked to this beach everyday while in Bali. Visited during early morning for less crowded, but sunset was a great time to visit and share a cocktail."
Wish M,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Bali my favorite place on this earth, I‚Äôm feeling so happy and relax, take your time and have a great holiday"
Marlucia2015,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"I liked the food very much and the waitress kartika is so nice , it‚Äôs a really good Indonesian food."
Sean H,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"I tried hard to ignore the plastic Bags, rubbish and pollution but there‚Äôs so much. The locals just don‚Äôt seem to care which is such a shame.Apart from that it‚Äôs a good place, there‚Äôs bars for Africa in the Legian area and overall it‚Äôs a good spot. I just wish the local govt would clean it up!!! "
RachelIddon,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Great waves, huge pull out to sea though so you have to be really careful with younger children. Cheap rental of sun loungers and surf boards. One warning if you buy anything from one of the beach seller's do it from a fixed one (there's plenty of little stalls) other wise they will all not leave you alone, we felt quite harassed at one point and we just all got in the sea to hide lol!! "
Just Sonia P,"Isle of Man, UK",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"a little cafe 20 min walk from beach , i thought name was Canteen as the wifi password was this. its not the clean canteen restaurant its a small wooden seating area cafe. lady run it she from Tawain, she stole from us & over charged 3 times the actual.priceworst place in seminyak so AVOID here or youl be robbed. cafe is within the streets on my upload"
Phil B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Two streams pouring their fetid bile onto the beach makes you think twice about going for a swim. And then there is the rubbish, plastic, dropped and ignored. While hotel staff meticulously sweep  fallen leaves, plastic chaos reigns but metres from their doors.  Change will only come when tourists fly over Bali or the powerful demand change"
MichelleESydney,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,This visit to Bali we found the water clean and as usual and beach user friendly we as a family had surfers and a young child so we used the beach to surf morning walks and runs along the beach 
Sandy851,"North Sydney, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Unfortunately this volcanic ash beach is terrible. There is dirt flowing down tiny little streams from building sites to the ocean. The ocean itself is not clean and if you happen to put your toes in and think the water looks clean, just view it from on high from a hotel room and you will see the pollution. The surf is dangerous with huge currents."
Luke T,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This beach is out of this world. Stunning views, clean, great selection of sun beds which are also reasonably priced. Only beach we visited in Bali simply for the fact we were so in love the moment we found it."
SMYTHTRIBE,"Perth, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,We always at least once a trip visit the beach for a late afternoon walk! Generally the tide is out and it‚Äôs less busy. The kids love looking for hermit crabs and splashing about in the shallows.This trip the beach was cleaner than we‚Äôve ever seen and we got watch a beautiful wedding. Plenty of places to grab a beanbag and a drink and meal! 
goddessofwisdom,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The water was clear the weather beautiful. So many fish and crabs and water pools. A delight to relax.  
Rajesh C,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"For someone from Chennai, this beach wasn‚Äôt something to write home about. Pretty small beach. Short walk to the sea. Can become dirty. Didn‚Äôt seem like a place for offshore activities - these are in other places in Bali. OK for just relaxing and sitting in the sand. Quite frankly, found nothing of interest in the beach. Which is both good and bad in its own ways. "
Ellac10,"West Yorkshire, UK",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The beach is huge, so it doesn‚Äôt feel crowded even when it‚Äôs busy. However, the sea is very choppy and not recommended for swimming in! Good for surfers and some nice restaurants!"
paceinyourface,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Tepid Indian ocean crashing onto the long sandy beach, always a pleasure.  Sure it's busy, but it's fun and relaxed.  Plenty to do and to look at.  Need to be a little mindful of the rip ...but it's well marked.  A great, fun and safe beach!"
Sonica A,55 contributions,Jun 2018,Wish there were shacks with food and drinks... we could spent longer time there. It is possibly the most beautiful beach we saw!
TMBom,"Mumbai, India",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"After The Jimbaran, Seminyak was the next best beach we experienced. As I mentioned earlier also that if you plan to stay in Seminyak you must stay at the beach front or close to the beach. It is a very lively area , shopping pubs and restaurants: nice place the stay and move around "
David F,38 contributions,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"A bit dirty and overcrowded. Came here for a long walk and to watch the sunset on a beachbag. If you're staying in Seminyak, I recommend coming for one day but then hiring a driver to take you to other prettier, cleaner beaches. "
sofy,Indonesia,Mar 2018,Best beach with wonderful sunset. Me and friend enjoy the sunset at la panca which is good and delicious food
The Anxious Traveller,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Seminyak beach is a nice beach but not amazing by any means. Expect black sand though . You can get cheap cold bintang from the guys at the top and rent beach chairs for 100,000 rupiah . There are many sellers up and down the beach . Wasn‚Äôt to busy in the month of May . "
Alyshia L,"York, UK",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Lovely beach but you can not swim on most of it. Sea is generally quite rough and dangerous. Lots of people selling things such as fake glasses and bags. Lots of little huts to purchase drinks. 
Disha V,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Not your typical ""relaxing"" beach. It's a typical city beach. Pricy, dirty but with good dining options."

Graeme R,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Great place to finish the day.Plenty of entertainment and characters. Sunsets are postcard quality.Plenty of options from blankets to bean bags or day beds to relax on  with drinks and friends.  
JojoBreda,"Breda, The Netherlands",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beaches are not the most beautiful in Bali but for sunset it's a must do to sit on one of the many bean bags and watch the sunset.Bit cloudy yesterday
PratikDShah,mumbai,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,One of the good beaches on the offer in Bali while they have many. overall the beach is good to hangout during the day expecially for the couple.
Emma Hamel,"Montreal, Canada",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"A lot of bar and restaurants around beach side, good place to see the sunset and have a beach walk, different than Kuta beach that has to many vendors, must visit while in Seminyak Bali."
Evyenia W,30 contributions,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,We tried to catch a sunset but it wasn‚Äôt much- the kids had fun running along the beach! Lots of cool restaurants and bars. 
AzianMatey,"Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Philippines",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Seminyak Beach is a long stretch of grey sandy beach situated in an upscale and private neighbourhood thats famous for its fabulous sunsets....
spuggy_10,"Peterlee, UK",Oct 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"beach is not the  cleanest, water can be very rough, but warm when you can use it, no facilities on beach for food/drink etc but can be bought not too far away."
Travelswithmyfriends,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,I had read the reviews for Seminyak beach but was pleasantly surprised. The water was lovely to swim in although caution is needed as the waves can be quite strong and only a small section is partrolled. Beach beds and umbrellas can be hired and cold drinks also on offer at reasonable prices. Most of the sun beds belong to the upmarket hotels along the beach.  A few hawkers but they are not particularly aggressive. The sand was clean and free of litter. The occasional horse rider along the foreshore is a real treat. Beautiful place to pass the time and watch the sunset. 
Debbie O,9 contributions,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Lovely well kept beach with lots of amenities.  Sunbed hire cheaper if u walk up to double six part of beach. 
CazzieCakes,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Asia and Seminyak Beach in this instance is drowning in plastic and it is disturbing as it is disgraceful.If your happy to swim amongst plastic straws, food wrappers, plastic tubes from toothpaste to skin bleaching cream I could not recommend this beach highly enough:( Bali has lost it for me as the pollution is now out of control.The lack of infrastructure and us bargain hunting holiday hounds have taken its toll.I‚Äôve been going to Bali for 30 years and seen it go from sublime to submerged.What a shame :( "
Imogen S,14 contributions,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"I prefer being here in the late afternoon/evenings, just to sit and watch the world go by, happy on a beanbag, I also bought some cute treats from sellers here! I didn‚Äôt swim, but it‚Äôs just so relaxed. My fave location on the beach is the b9b bar :)"
KenSSnavely,"Los Angeles, CA",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak Beach is great for walking in either direction. Surf lessons, not crowded, great photo opportunities, the Bali clouds as a back drop. And sunsets are a time for people to gather and take lots of photos. "
David S,"Bendigo, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Plenty of places to eat or you can just stroll the beach and watch the sunset. Plenty of hawkers trying to sell you many things that you possibly don't need but it adds to the atmosphere. Visit the beach for a sunset if you have the time.
Oldboganbull,"Pambula, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Very safe surf beach, clean by Bali standards but water quality not the best. A great place to watch the sunset whilst enjoying a cold and very cheap Bintang from a bean bag and having a neck and foot massage. The street / beach sellers are everywhere but not too aggressive and it‚Äôs fun to barter with them ( you can offer low prices without offending them) and sometimes pick up a real bargain. If you frequent the same ‚Äúhosts‚Äù on a regular basis they will treat you like royalty and remember you for years. Certainly safe for all the family."
blue_wahine,"Redondo Beach, CA",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"When you walk through the entrance, past the parking area, and over the bridge, there are women who try to sell sarongs and bracelets.  I have no use for both, so I did not purchase any.There was even a man selling canvas unframed paintings for 800,000 Rupiah, which he claimed he painted and ‚Äúused to have a shop‚Äù in Seminyak, but he sold it.  Beautiful beach to watch the waves, and lay out.  I rented a beach chair and umbrella for 50,000 Rupiah ($3.50 USD) which was a deal, as when I was in the Caribbean, the Beach Chair and Umbrella rental was $25 USD and you must order expensive food off their Menu, like a $15 cocktail and $25 hamburger, so this was a bargain.I was there about 11:00am, with hardly anyone on the beach.  An hour before Sunset, many people were coming to the beach. Kids playing soccer on the sand. Everyone there to watch the sunset.  I probably had about 3 different vendors come up to try to sell, but none were persistent. I politely said no, and they walked away.Beautiful Sunset views."
Tambonz,"Waipu, New Zealand",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,However the street hawkers on the beach do spoil it a bit .... Beer ? Chair? Jewellery? Sunglasses? Rings ? etc
GeoffC5,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The beach sand is grey with dirt, but still really popular at sunset, with the beach crowded, especially on the week-end and around Full Moon time"
Lindsay P,"Tauranga, New Zealand",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"A large expansive beach which has a very gentle gradient into the sea. Excellent for families to swim or those that do not like large wave activity. Can get very busy with many holiday makers enjoying the area. Lots of people surfing ( or trying to ) which was at time a good laugh. The beach was relatively clean with very little rubbish which was pleasing to see. The hawkers weren't bad, a few of them, but no trouble. A very good beach to relax at."
Nat C,28 contributions,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"Walked off a hangover whilst my friend slept hers off!! Very nice clean beach. I didn‚Äôt get harassed much by the sellers, there were lots of surf lessons available, restaurants and bars were set slightly back from the beach so as to not ruin the peace! "
Sara L,"Leamington Spa, UK",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"It's a beach, it is clean and ad you'd expect has a good selection of lounger for the day. 50,000 seems to be the going rate. Some do towel hire too.The hawkers are there but not intrusive.  You will pay a bit of a premium for drinks the closer you are to the big hotels but the warungs rather than the beach huts offer better value and reasonable food. Try cantina to the right of W. Has a decent toilet too.Watch the current, it is strong and swim only where there is a lifeguard.  "
Di B,26 contributions,May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"It is lovely being near the beach and viewing it from restaurant decks etc but I did not like being on the beach so much. We are spoilt in Australia, beautiful white sand so the dark colour was a little strange. I did not enjoy swimming as there was quite a bit of rubbish in the water"
Gary B,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,nice beach to chill and plenty of places to get a drink or food . water sometimes a bit rough but clean and surf ok if thats what you want or hire surf boards even lessons available 
ShellsBellz,"Wilmslow, UK",May 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Visited here April / May 18, and was pretty disappointed.  The sea is very rough and no good for swimming.  There was a lot of rubbish washed up on the beach. In our 10 day stay we only went to this beach once as the visit did not inspire us to come back for a 2nd visit. In fact struggled to find a beach in Bali that impressed us....can't beat the Caribbean for me!"
Cityboytraveller,"London, UK",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Good destination for a few days if passing through. Local government together with hotels needs to try to tackle the issue otherwise people will stop coming.
James K,9 contributions,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"The beach at Seminyak is much preferable than Kuta. Seminyak is a bit quieter and the people who are at Seminyak seem more international and discerning. The gentle rolling waves are ideal for beginner surfers and it is also good for swimming. Just a shame a bit the bits of plastic floating in the waters. Really sad to see. I picked up them myself and disposed of them in the rubbish bin and so did a few other tourists. If we all do that at the beaches in Bali, we can try to beat the plastic pollution problem.Oh, the sunsets at Seminyak are a sight to behold! Grab a bean bag and a drink and drink it all in."
jbmb1982,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Pleasant beach for a walk . Cleaner than we were expecting. Over-all  worth a visit but unless you like big crowds on bean bags and constant interruption by touts, you will probably only visit once.Cafes and bars dearer that in town and not as good. We went once for a daytime walk , and once for a sunset. After that , we had no reason to return.Its a personal choice."
Mishmashoflife,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2018,"This place has views that are priceless however the beach was dirty and rubbish blowing all around you, people constantly badgering you selling their items was a pain and not the best place we felt for safety. View yes beach no it was nasty ,who goes to a beach to pick a spot sitting there with rubbish at the side of them. We chose here for our wedding vow renewal and were very disappointed, don‚Äôt bank on this place for a wedding shot there is so much better places then here in the hills by the rice fields Bali struggles at best.We had to clear rubbish first as there was no gaps on the beach as there was already rubbish there and strangely enough a person came along to pick it up removed leaves from the trees that had fallen on the beach and left the rubbish go figure very odd. The view yes but just to get this shot alone yep we had to turn in to rubbish collectors before our wedding vow renewal not ideal but we had flown so far it was poor to say the least not a great start for a special day. "
K D,"London, UK",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,Loved this beach. It has a nice vibe to it. It‚Äôs peaceful and the sunset is amazing. Colourful and unique. 
JR_Essex,"Chelmsford, UK",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"This is a great beach for walking however it is not without problems, mainly cleanliness. Most of this comes from offshore so is difficult to control and the hotels try and clean their part. The other issue is dogs messing on the beach. In Bali dogs are free to roam and you have to treed carefully. Sunsets are fantastic however."
Richard B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak Beach is particularly great in the afternoons as the day cools as it can be a bit of a hot place, don't get me wrong you can hire lounge chairs and umbrellas, cool drinks are never to far away. I particularly like the beach for it's beach break and good surf, I surfed Ku De Ta (in front of) and Seminyak beach in from of the temple, both spots are equally as good, most prefer to surf in front of Ku De Ta. Seminyak beach is extremely  popular at sunset as the view is breathtaking. At night time the restaurants and bars along the foreshore have bands and live music. There is always a buzz of life at Seminyak beach from the colourful people selling their wares, offering massages and all the beautiful life interactions. Definitely a place to visit and relax at.."
Clark Kenneth,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Nov 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"i call this So-So Beach, because for me its already to crowded and it's make the sea water become dirty, but the view was Amazing when we chill and 'sunset-ing' "
Gastronoman61,"New York City, NY",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Dont understand what tourists see in this foul smelling and overcrowded beach. THis used to be a great spot 20 years ago but has deteriorated to such a point that I wouldn't even walk my dog there. One can see seweage water being pumped onto the beaches and frankly some of the worst eateries and bars in the area. Stay away if you're looking for a white sandy beach.
Taufik N,Indonesia,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Seminyak Beach reckoned as best place to enjoy sunset. It is the same coast as Kuta Beach with wider sand bed line for evening walk. thin sea water over the sand create wide mirror effect. during visit it was bit cloudy, yet still able to got few minutes of sparkling golden sunset before covered by lower cloud."
cirque,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Not as crowded as Doublesix but Seminyak beach is the place to go for quiet time enjoying yourself basking under the sun, you can also view some surfing activities too. "
Kat S,"Bairnsdale, Australia",Apr 2018,"We ventured to Seminyak beach like all tourists to see the Sunset. The Sunset was stunning, so worth it. The beach itself is dirty... rubbish from people everywhere - did not swim at this beach. Brown dirt sand with rubbish sitting on the shoreline. Same at Legian and Kuta all the way along that coastline. Such a shame this place is marred by rubbish from human use."
Pricie1,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,Do yourself a favour and call Made when you holidaying in Bali. Best driver we have ever had and we have been a few times now. Made speaks great English and knows the areas and customs / history very well. Made has many contacts in Bali so is a wealth of knowledge. Easy to contact through messenger so organising all our transport requirements was a breeze. Thanks Made! I have taken a photo of Made‚Äôs business card for your reference. 
venonsim,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Nice Beach with stunning view! Definitely a must visit for anyone of any purpose. Sunrise or sunset is a must to see. 
Na Tone,42 contributions,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,I‚Äôll give it 3 stars because it‚Äôs nice to hang out but there are better beaches to go. With clear water and white sand for example. 
andyst81,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This beach at sunset is a real highlight of Seminyak. There are a lot of people, but the vibe is super chilled and there are some really nice places to sit, eat and drink.A must do at least once for everyone in the area."
donnat_11,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,A little disappointed with Seminyak Beach after Kuta.  No chairs on beach or options to have a cool drink while you watch the sun set.  Every man and his dog there.  Nothing spectacular about the sand or the water.  Creek running into the beach made for a not-very-pleasant ambiance.
burygirlkeeper,"Bury, UK",Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Lovely warm clean water, opportunity to hire sun loungers and surf boards. Lots of bars and good music, cheap and expensive food options."
tonysprings,hartlepool,Apr 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Lovely beach to walk along and lay on but always barter for a sunbed. Very clean and good for swimming or surfing....well worth a visit...
Kaehto,Singapore,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"While I agree that this could be a beautiful beach to watch sunsets - this is the definition of dirty... Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. All you ever dreamt of in terms of plastic waste is available, yoghurt cups, plastic bags, syringes. And of course many other things like bottles etc. More than high time that local authoritiues (""guided"" by the Tourism stakeholders) take decisive action."
Linda C,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach has black sand and has quite a lot of rubbish on it. There is also rubbish I. The sea and it is very choppy so not good for swimming but good for surfing 
Danny C,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Sadly the beach has been used and not maintained, the rubbish is piled at the back of the beach and the sea is full of old plastic bags etc and who knows what else. The sufers seem to like it due to the high waves but for general swiming and bathing i would advise to choose another location. I also think the locals and goverment could do more to help clean up the beach and surrounding areas. We moved on after a short stay and will not be returning."
vanness77,37 contributions,Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,I usually go to the beach club but walking along the Seminyak beach is a great experience for me. Better come in July-August though. 
Kellie G,"Hobart, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"I've been here a few times, and while I love the little beach cafes and seeing lots of people walking and the locals, it's not a beach I would swim in. There's a lot of rubbish along the waterline. Dogs doing their business in the water... Pretty at night with the cafes and beach seating, well worth the look. Great for long beach walks. Lots of swim schools, but again, I wouldn't swim in the water. "
sashasen,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,I used to visit the Seminyak beach especially the private beach of Marriott ... the beach is clean and so is the water ... something that cannot be said about its counterparts in Kuta ... it is not tio crowded unlike Kuta and Legian and has a classy feel to it ... Overall a nice experience !
Man571,"Hyderabad, India",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We spent about 4 hours during sunset at Double dix beach . Beach is great with medium waves for kids .   Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach , they offer bean bags to relax  while eating with live music and flood lighting right until midnight . "
travelerFlorida_USA,"Pompano Beach, FL",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The beach in Seminyak was a bit disappointed as although sandy the water was not very clear and the beach had a lot of debris around. We were told the beach is cleaned every morning and the plastic bottles, wrappers and other debris is brought in by the current. Every afternoon, people gather at the beach to watch the sunset. There are many bars and music. The big is quite long. "
MihiAHerbert,"Gosford, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Our experience at Seminyak beach was good. Friendly people offering you a Bintang and surfing lessons.
Freddy S,"Terrigal, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great spot to sit in bean bagd and watch sunset whilst drinking Bintangs.Only down side is rubbish left on beach
Dagalong,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,The night life on the beach is amazing.  The food was great and the atmosphere impossible to fault with all that goes on.
jaceka49,"Jacksonville, FL",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach itself is very nice and there are a lot of restaurant and resorts on the beach. I often go to beach to enjoy the sunset.
anton10186,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The sun set is owesome.  The beach is near many hotel ,.  I was not able to enjoy since the beach is dirty.  Many garbage from the visitor.   As visitor . We must come and go without leave something in the beach.  "
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Seminyak beach is black sand beach and the sea is generally clean to swim in.  The best part of the beach is the sunset. As seminyak is on the west part of Bali, you will get spectacular sunsets each day.  There are some restaurants with lots of chairs and lounge for guests to have drinks and watch the sunset. "
Pierre/Mary W,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,We had the chance to visit the beach at Seminyak. Our biggest surprise was to find the beach covered with rubbish. Plastic everywhere and no one seems to care. I spent one month in 1982 and we called Bali a small paradise. To return there was very disappointing and if nobody care about pollution let‚Äôs continue this way and have a great holiday on the communal tip.
Huxter09,"Numurkah, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"Seminyak beach , a long greyish sand beach with endless swell atm. Not a lot of crowd and like everyone else, we're wondering where all the tourists are . Is Mt Agung and it's low rumbles keeping tourists away ? Suits us as we can have our pick of beach lounges , cold drinks at hand and out three year old grandson to entertain us while his Daddy surfs.Bosrd hire seems cheap but our boy has his one of his own , designed for North Narrabeen but handling Bali's surf beautifully .Horse riding along the beach too and not much sign of the litter problem we'd be warned about . Hazy day but just beautiful and a bit of breeze to cool us down . Perfect "
Jennifer L,1 contribution,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Clean, good for enjoying your sunday after stress working. I like to come here a lot. never bored seeing the ocean"
TonyCondon,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"A good place to unwind and catch the rays. Beach has vast array of hotels bars and restaurants, covering the whole cost spectrum. From a photograph or seaside pool, is fits the postcard image. The negative is unfortunately the swim in the ocean or walk on the sand where all forms of modern day waste ruin the experience."
Tazim Z,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Nothing like laying on a bean bag under a colorful Arabian style umbrella, smoking shisha with catchy loud music in the background and relaxedly enjoying the pre-evening beach breeze and sunset @ Seminyak Beach.Simply awesome!!! üèñüåÑüèäüèªüèÇüéº"
Heidi G,"Tromso, Norway",Mar 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,What a beautiful bechwalk. But no swim - unless you like swimming with plastic litter. But all the beanbag cafees are  soo nice ‚ô°
Priyansh M,"Ahmedabad, India",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"May be it's us, but after visiting beaches at Kuta and Nusa dua, somehow Seminyak was a let down. It's not bad. It's decent infact. But it neither has hustle of Kuta nor the serenity of Nusa dua.. "
gensivalingam,"George Town, Malaysia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Can be improved more especially cleanliness. safely also can be concern here as very large number of tourist in this place
Vtan888,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,Most hotels around seminyak have private beaches. Tend to have strong waves so might not be ideal for swims. Along the seminyak main road there are many restaurant and pubs. Hip and busy so great for a night out.. 
Janice,"Cape Town, South Africa",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"As far as beaches go, this has got to be the worst beach l have ever seen. I was her a year previous and returned to see if it had been cleaned since, it had not.It had raw sewage coming down a river which continues to flow down the river a year later. There were no white horses in the sea but brown horses of sewage. Coming to Bali for this beach would be a big mistake."
Marijka T,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,I can‚Äôt say I have ever seen that much domestic waste being washed up on the beach. It is being cleaned many times during the day but not great to go in the sea. 
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Once beautiful Bali is now the most polluted island in the world with its water literally thick with rubbish of all types. Nappies and bags and all sorts of disgusting items wrap around your face if your foolish enough to swim in it.  This beach and its waters are literally toxic and J advise you not to swim at the beach. It smells and the rubbish piles high on the sand.
tarmigan50,"Norwich, UK",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,If you want a beach holiday dont go here the beaches are disgusting litter everywhere. People say they try to clear it up but im sorry if you want tourists to come here you need to try harder. It is not good for an island the rely on tourism. Please tell me why i would want to pay to sit on your sunbeds surrounded by rubbish get a rake and a bin bag and clear it up PLEASE. Its such a shame as the rest of the island is beautiful. Go to Sanur sunbeds half the price and no rubbish.
Sam B,"London, UK",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"The place is so dirty I don't know how anyone can want to come here! We stayed in Seminyak for 4 nights thinking it would be a beach holiday but we took one look at the beach and we couldn't understand how this place is advertised as a beach destination.The waves are so high and rough you cannot swim in the sea, and the sand has so much rubbish it's disgusting. Poor wildlife! Such a shame. Even large 5 star resort hotels didn't seem to care to clean up the patch of sand that their hotels overlook.We ended up sending the 4 nights in Seminyak around a pool. Will not be returning."
team l,2 contributions,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Plastic Rubbish can be seen EVERYWHERE. Worst part is, smelly water from sewage directly goes to the ocean water; no pipe is used, water flows to the sand and then to the ocean. So disgusting. Very disappointing."
jotage2017,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Beautiful shore line and sandy beach but extremely dirty please wear shoes as their is broken glass and rubbish everywhere 
Kylie S,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"You will find the beach has black sand and accommodates many bars & restaurants There is no escaping beach sellers, with sarongs, paintings and other trinkets with thier well rehearsed ""I give you good deal"" The beach is littered with rubbish, broken glass and other not so friendly beach items.During the day its hot, with some what rough conditions.The beach offers direct walking access to Kuta in the south, or Potato Head in the north.At night the beach comes alive with bean bags, colourful umbrellas and beach dining.Definitely go explore and make your own decision. For me, its not a swimming beach."
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,We have been a regular visiter to the beach over many years and little has changed. Hawkers in plenty but once you no how to handle them they add to the scene. BINTANG is cold and offered at a cheap price so grab a beer relax and enjoy the sunset.
sydneyloner,sydney,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"I've been to this part of Bali for 5/6 times over the years but I was horrified to see how polluted this beach has become this time. It really has no reason to visit anymore unless the local government acts immediately and strenuously to curb use of plastic packaging on the island. I also found injection needle on the beach but when I handed it to a guy who was cleaning he didn't seem to be too care about what I found, which might reflect such found was nothing unusual. I'll go elsewhere instead of Bali or at least this part of Bali anyway."
Ontheroadagain4648,"Sussex Inlet, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"I know its popular and well known, but as far as beaches are concerned it is just a beach. There are so many nicer, cleaner and more picturesque beaches in the world...must admit on a nice evening sunset it does look romantic."
ebatancs,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Trash everywhere on the beach. Cleaned regularly, but it is just piled up at the back of the beach. Not too bothered by traders hassling. If you don't engage in conversation, they leave you alone."
Adam H,"Redbank Plains, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,An amazing sunset there was not to many persons there on the night we went there i would say a must stop for any person havi g a holiday in bali. Amazing photo opportunities 
Deeyaneeh C,31 contributions,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Quite disappointed with the beach. It was dirty and trash is on the shore. I didn‚Äôt swim and I dare not to swim. Maybe it was because of the weather since it‚Äôs wet season but still, they could have done better! "
Jenny,"Rasnov, Romania",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"This is the dirtiest beach I‚Äôve seen in Bali so far. They clean it regularly but still there is a lot of garbage. Good for surfers-beginners. Sand and small waves (white water). No good schools nearby though (at least I haven‚Äôt come across). There is a lot of bars on this beach. The ones that are close to the entrance are very expensive, the further the cheaper. There are people trying selling you goods but not a lot of them and they pass if you ignore them. "
julia_le84,"Richland, WA",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We came in February and it was dirty with trash.  From what we heard, the storm pushed all trash from other islands to the beaches.  So hopefully it will be nicer when you go."
MichelleR1965,"Camberley, UK",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The guys looking after the beds do a great job of clearing what is the dirtiest beach we've been too. So much rubbish coming ashore. I certainly would not swim in the sea. Such a shame as it's such a nice sandy beach
Nyu24,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Perfect sunset, nice beer and lite bites; the  unbeatable combination. We loved to spend time here until the sun was down. "
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,This is not what you see on the tourism photos. Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. It spoils the beach but it also spoils the harmony. Bali is not a beach paradise with this spoiling it that is for sure.2203
Kevin T,"Hoi An, Vietnam",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Though it was raining hard this morning, it was a nice walk! There were a bit of rubbish on the beach at some places but it was raining , so guessing all the rubbish are being washed out onto the beach but like I've said it was a very nice walk by the sea üôÇ. "
Paul E R,United Kingdom,Feb 2018,"First time we went down to the beach, there was a lot of trash on the beach.  Maybe thrown up by some rough seas, but it was a little disconcerting to have to step over it.  Now it appears there has been some effort to clear it up, but some still remains.It didn't impact our stay at all, but worth noting.  Look past that, and it's still beautiful. "
Christian S,"Beijing, China",Feb 2018,Overall Bali is quite dirty. Trash everywhere. The Seminyak and Kuta beach strip is probably the dirtiest beach I‚Äôve ever experienced. There‚Äôs much better and cleaner beaches on Bali such as geger beach in Nusa dua or belinga beach.
Blazing P,23 contributions,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,I found Seminyak beach a little off putting with so much rubbish washed up along the sand. üò£ Not sure why so many people travel to Bali for the beach life when the jungle is so much more beautiful üçÉ
Marian P,4 contributions,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Great beach but at this time was pretty dirty with washed up rubbish - mainly plastic . Have to say the locals were out early morning to clear each day . 
Andy P,50 contributions,Feb 2018,Really disappointed with the cleanliness of the beach.It‚Äôs pretty much a rubbish dump for plastic.  It seems to be a bit of an environmental disaster that no one is willing to address.It‚Äôs a very depressing beach and not somewhere that is enjoyable to spend time.Bali you need to clean up the environment! 
rinna62,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,Walked along the beach and was so dirtyNot sure if I could ever swim thereThe council needs to do something to improve
roberto,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,compared to kuta beach this is heaven. It is clean and it is cleaned every morning there are heaps of places offering umbrellas and Lounge deck chairs and the umbrellas there are cheap motorbikes and taxis to take you anywhere there are cold drinks and toilets available
tinablueeyes87,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,We went for a walk on  Seminyak beach 2 days ago and were horrified to find how filthy and littered with rubbish it was. There is no beauty to this beach and even upon finding Ku De Ta (by mistake) we wouldnt have known it was there as the beach there was still filthy. There was rubbish in piles and mounds everywhere. Will not be back to Scuminyak beach nor will we suggest it to anyone :-(
Takako R,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"We went for a walk along Seminyak beach, and we were not impressed.Rubbish, plastic, bottles everywhere!People were sitting down on the beach and having drinks and dinner right in front of rubbish...Inside of hotels and villas are always kept clean but why don‚Äôt they look after their island??  Have seen local people eating food and throwing rubbish after they finish on the street and beaches...Keep your island CLEAN !!"
fmrosealex,"Dublin, Ireland",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Went here in February and left immediately, but not before paying the extortionate price of 100k for a sun lounger and being harassed by multiple women selling sarongs etc. The beach was filthy, littered in plastic and the sea was full of plastic too - my boyfriend literally came out with food wrappers stuck to his body. The waves were huge but not good for surfing and people were being taken out by the waves even in shallow watwr. The water is warm but it‚Äôs warm everywhere else in Bali too so go somewhere else "
JessJake1923,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,Went to Seminyak to check out the beach and got a huge shock the beach was disgusting rubbish piled up all over it We were told it was the weather that caused the rubbish So many plastic bags all washed up we were shocked to see the beach looking like a huge rubbish tip 
carryonabroad,Melb,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"What a tip during this time of year, could not believe our eyes first morning we ventured down to walk the beach rubbish strewn as far as you could see just as many other travellers pics have shown  , INDONESIA get your act together this is disgraceful , we are told  'its all from Java "" due to the stormy weather around this time of year REALLY? . Would not go anywhere near swimming in the ocean on this coast of Bali if you want a cleaner beach try Sanur as this Problem runs from Jimbaran to Seminyak"
Michael P,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Went for a day during low season (January), when it's said that trade winds wash a fair amount of pollution into the area. The beach itself was filthy - could have used a good cleaning. Did not go into the water. Hawkers everywhere. Just dirty, dirty, dirty - couldn't wait to shower after leaving the place."
Steve G,"Forresters Beach, Australia",Jan 2018,Not the cleanest beach we have seen and be careful not to be run over by the learn to surf groups. Nevertheless the water is cooler than the outside temp and the sunbeds for hire are very comfortable but we did swim one at a time in the surf for fear of losing gear..
ShaunSAFA,"Karratha, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We were looking forward to some beach time in the sun. Unfortunately Seminyak beach was covered in trash very very dirty, not impressed."
Russell D,"Hampton, Australia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach looks quite dirty with rubbish collected in piles most mornings.The sand is dark and grainy.We didn't swim as it didn't look clean.Mainly busy on a Sunday as the locals have family gatherings.
kathryn soo,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"This area of beach is better than double six beach. Much cleaner and less rubbish. Also, you can hop into bars for a drink or just for sunset view at any bars around. Come here for chilling by the beach instead of double six beach"
SiddiM,86 contributions,Feb 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"This beach has a scenic view , surrounded my multiple shacks but unfortunately not maintained.You see garbage lying all around, shacks aren't clean and hygienic , there were no sea guards.... There were no swings- which is like the usp of Bali ! Overall I suggest can be avoided ! "
chyland,Halland Lewes,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"We visited this beach every day in December it was very quiet as it was December. The people were amazing on the beach. The most disappointing thing was the accumulation of rubbish all day long that washed in from the sea. Some of the locals cleared it up first thing and then it was washed in again, a never ending task. It put me off this beach and sea as it seemed very dirty."
Flitz8-A foodie travels,"Athens, Greece",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"There's a lot of eateries along this beach and most go for sunset view along this coast,very busy beach and not cleanest"
Kunal B,"Jaipur, India",Dec 2017,I think the beaches in India are better than this. The beach was absolutely dirty and filthy except in front of the oberoi which they clean themselves. on seeing the beach I wondered why bali is rated so highly as a destination when the beaches are filthy and there is lots of traffic jam
Claudio D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Where to see one of the best sunset in the world?Bali...... At Seminyak beach.So, 5 deserved stars !!!! "
Glamp Bazaar,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Solo,"This beach is beautiful and has lots of great waves if you're into surfing. Also great if you're a first time surfer they have tons of affordable surfing lessons and the waves are great but not so intense that it's a hard place to learn. There are great little beachfront restaurants and bars, and it's pretty easy to get a lounge chair if you go early enough. Negotiate for it and don't pay more than 50-100K rupiah for 2-3 hours. Sadly, there is a lot of trash on this beach. So walking along the water is not a great experience because you're dodging washed up trash and plastic bags. "
nitemist,"Canberra, Australia",Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Couples,"Ok straight up here...the beach is horrible.  Why you ask...ill tell you...its polluted with rubbish that gets washed up due to the rainy season or due to tourists leaving waste on the beach.  Every morning we watched locals tirelessly try to remove rubbish, youd come back the next day and it would all start again.  Maybe were spot with our australian beaches and ecpectations that all beaches should look like ours but this was really sad.  Of more concern was that young children were allowed by parents to run tgrough the litter without a care in the world.  I can tell you know there is no way i would tramp through the litter to fet to the water let alone alliw a child too.  I wouldnt even enter the waters on this beach its just not worth it.Its not all gloom though.  Late acternoon tge restarants open up and you can have some great dri ks and meals on yhe beach watching the sunset.  Most cafes have their own music and the food is good (id recommend trying b9b we fou d them the best).  Go have a look at Semenyak beach but dont be mislead by images showing you thats its a pristine haven youll be dissapointed."
Nikita B,33 contributions,Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Couples,The beach is nice and has a good stretch if you would like to walk. Usually in the evening the tide increases. Couldnt see any lifeguards nor is a beach for swimming as the water did not look very clean. Overall my recommendation would be to chill at the beach clubs/hotel facing the sea and not bother swimming in the sea - use the infinity pools out there. 
Pradnya_Kanekar,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,The beach is not very clean and the food stalls near the beach aren't very hygienic. If you have access to the beach through some villas r resorts then that portion of the beach is a must visit
Naomilee75,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018 ‚Ä¢ Family,"So the 5 of us, (hubby and 3 kids and I) went for a walk on the beach around 6pm. The tide was out and all we could see was rubbish. üò™ There was so much rubbish on the beach being washed up, it was really sad to see. There were people everywhere and it just like it was so normal to them. It would be nice to maybe have more bins on the beach and make the locals and tourists aware of how bad it is to litter on the beach. Not only for the looks of the beach but also for the sea life. At breakfast the next day in our resort, I asked the manager if it was ever cleaned. He told me that the beach was cleaned every night. WOW- I was surprised. During that morning, we went for another walk and there was minimal rubbish. (Sadly, it was there again every night, but that did not stop the people coming in. ) The waves üåä looked amazing and many people were enjoying themselves surfing, swimming etc. We decided to just swim in the pool instead. The sand in front of The Royal Beach Resort was very grey, not the sand I expected. Nor, was it any good for making Sand Castles. Still a nice view though. üòäThis photo is more towards Seminyak where the sand got a better. This was also during the day. "
CuriousTravellerDXB,Dubai,Dec 2017 ‚Ä¢ Friends,"Oh Seminyak, your streets in general were so well maintained but the public beach strip was a disgrace. I know that we were there in rainy season and the sea throws up more garbage than usual, but watching the tourist hordes also treat the beach like a dumping ground and only a few bars/hotels making an effort to clean up was extremely disappointing. I've lived and worked in Asia in similarly touristy destinations and this is the worst I've seen in a long time. Friends staying further along the coast had an entirely different experience so that's reassuring but we didn't even swim in the sea because of this. Bali, you are a beautiful island with beautiful people, culture and food. Please don't forget the beaches (and kick the butts of tourist litter louts!)."
