MADHURKJAIN,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2019,"Beautiful and pristine Bech with clear waters. Enjoyed a lot of water sports also like water scooter, parachutes, sea walk. A nice combination of adventure and relaxation"
mmuazhiim,83 contributions,Oct 2019,Beautiful and stunning view of the beach. Clear blue sky . The landscpae of this place itself is so breathtaking i cannot explain with my own words.
Sam Ibrahim,"Sanur, Indonesia",Dec 2019,You arrifve and are immeditely overwhelmed by the natural beauty/serinity; you can stay there all day take in the natural beauty of the location.  
Aslam_Sherif,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Nusa Dua are the best beaches I saw on Bali. Nusa Dua is all about beach walking, sunbathing, swimming or water sports. Walking along this beach in the evening is very relaxing."
JodyBonny,"Mendrisio, Switzerland",Dec 2019,Move to the central area. Wave and tides clean away plastic scraps and alga. Much cleaner and easy swimming
Patricia R,3 contributions,Nov 2019,Truly a remarkable and pristine area. Can thoroughly recommend the whole area. Such a pleasure to meander along the whole area. 
David Read,46 contributions,Sep 2019,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian. The black sand beaches up in Tabanan and Tanah Lot  are only better because there's no-one on them :)"
Susan Z,"Madrid, Spain",May 2019,It was nice to place to relax beach! It was great to be for swiming. It was very clean and quite water to dove in! Will recommend it
Maria B,"Lappeenranta, Finland",Oct 2019,"Nice, clean and long beach with cafes and restaurants. Also has green walking territory. Especially great for early morning photosets at sunrise time "
PrestonGuild,United Kingdom,Jun 2019,A very good beach maintained by the hotels. It is cleaner than say Kuta beach and less busier.We went for a dip in the sea but much preferred to swim in the hotel pool. There is a safe swimming area.You will have people wandering around selling stuff and boat trips but they do not hassle you too much. Just say a polite no.I found it a nice play to relax and enjoy the sun.
GrandTour817128,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"Gorgeous view, clean and white sandy beach, secluded from local inhabitants. Perfect place for enjoying beach and lying on sun bed all day long"
Ashish J,"Pinner, UK",Dec 2019,We spent about an hour at the beach. We clean and nice beach. You can find the shade to sit in even on a hot day. A good place to watch the world go by as you bring your own pace down. Do visit the beach if you have a couple of hours to spare and are in South Bali.
Adri Rozali Sandi,"Gunung Putri, Indonesia",Dec 2019,Go here in the morningLow currentLow tideClean white sandy beachKids safely played and swim hereWe visited our hotel beach clubEnough number day bed and lounger bedA shower room
Tony Halim,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Most beaches here are privately managed by the hotels and thus are very clean. Only issue here is you can't catch the sun set as it faces the East. 
Purnima Banka,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"The beaches are clean and beautiful, surrounded by all luxury hotels. It has a bali collection mall which also leads to the beach, this place is vibrant and is nested with many pretty cafes and restaurants, with live music flowing in most of them. It certainly has a great vibe and awesome for some leisure time!!"
Amalia S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,Nice beach clean & easy to swim. We are happy to spend some time in here. Only food is the problem need to go back and forth to our fav resto. 
rodb987,"Grande Prairie, Canada",Dec 2019,Nice white sand large surfing waves quite a ways off shore at high tide. Most beaches are nicely maintained by hotels (raking up and burying the sea weed washing up on shore). Typical water sport activities for hire along beach. 
ThunderBear1982,"Hangzhou, China",Dec 2019,"I went with my wife for a leisurely swim. We stayed in Jimbaran, but many friends had told me Nusa Dua Beach was a must see. It wasn't.It certainly wasn't terrible but there are far more stunning beaches in southern Bali to check out, such as Greenbowl and Suluban.The water was crystal clear, but you have to swim in swaths of seaweed and some plastic.The beach had many big resorts on it, but it didn't make the beach crowded. There is also a small restaurant and a hut where some locals provide massage, which my wife said was great."
Mudhoo,7 contributions,Dec 2019,Beautiful walk around the beach area. Nice view of sunset and blow hole. Safe for children to walk around the loop. Good surfing area. 
Pranab k,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Great beach if you are looking for privacy and experience of Bali beaches at the same time. Great for families 
Jan V,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Dec 2019,"It is a long, probably 4-5 km white sand strip to the East of Bukit paninsular with it's pros and cons. I would say the most fashionable beach with posh hotels manicured lawns and picturesque blue sea. Cons are the rocky coral sea base and plenty of algas in that season, so one has to hunt for a clean spot to enter the sea. I would line it third to Legian and Uluwatu beaches."
Stephen C,"1,055 contributions",Dec 2019,"Some would argue that Nusa Dua has become too commercialized as hotels are sprinkled all over this area. Along with that comes the restaurants and shops targeting tourists.But if you don't mind all that, then Nusa Dua beach is a must visit place. The currents are decent and you will spot many surfers riding the waves here.There is also a nice beach walk that links almost throughout the entire beach so you can just walk along to enjoy the landscaping that the different hotels put together.Certainly a nice place to just hang out and get a good tan. Waters are also safe for swimming."
Kelly S,32 contributions,Dec 2019,"This is a beautiful beach, plently of space so you won't be sitting on top of anyone and very clean water fine for swimming :-)"
Cherie H,"Roumazieres-Loubert, France",Dec 2019,"Great cove for swiming, its bouyed of for safety from boats going past. Loads of cafes and restuarnts and 5 star hotels along the s hjore and the great Bay area for chilled low cost time"
Fahmi,10 contributions,Dec 2019,"Quite Beach , not too many peoples even on weekend surrounding ITDC Area. Need extra special passes from Hotels but very friendly for Family Vacation."
Nicky2015,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2019,"Don’t choose this beach if you want to surf: but it’s ideal for gentle Swimming, snorkeling and lounging with the family. Very pretty views and nice breezes in the afternoon from the beach club tables under the trees lining the resort. "
Nino,103 contributions,Dec 2019,The beach is filthy with sea weed and dirt everywhere.  The image of beautiful blue water is an absolute distortion of the truth.  In fact this is probably the worst beach I have been to.  Regret falling for false advertising on Nusa Dua 
Robert R,"Woodvale, Australia",Dec 2019,this beach is great!! very clean and shallow great for small kids its cleaned every day and water here is largely unpolluted 
DS of Hove,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Dec 2019,Our hotel (Marriott) had a reserved area of the beach with loungers and umbrellas plus a beach bar/cafe. We walked along the beach for 800 mtrs and it was very quiet. The beach is swept clean every night. There is a barrier of reefs 200 mtrs off the shore and a lagoon forms behind this but at low tide it is too shallow to swim in so find out the tides if you want to swim in the incredibly warm sea (it needs to be at least middle tide for a reasonable swim).
Sherpa26568007543,"Yuma, AZ",Dec 2019,Great public beach.  The each side is great for early morning walks on the beach.  The hotels make sure the beach is cleaned of seaweed each morning after the high tide.  The eastern beach is much better than the northern side past the 2 nusas
Mr. Hunter,"Port Vila, Vanuatu",Dec 2019,The beaches of Nusa Dua are heavenly but in December the heat might be overbearing. Its a great beach to make wonderful memories and forget about your worries in the city. An absolute gift from Heaven. 
James D,"Cronulla, Australia",Nov 2019,"We stayed at the Mulia Villas that had direct access to this beach and wow, talk about being spoilt , it seemed that as soon as you left footsteps in the sand they were raked over like a divot in a bunker.The water was clean and the surf breaking on the reef not too far out was also worth exploring at low tide.All up, clean and safe."
Stewartholt,"York, UK",Dec 2019,I'm assuming that the beach we visited from our hotel (Courtyard Marriott) was Nusa Dua Beach. If it wasn't then apologies for the review. We walked along the Beach area and it was quite well manicured but was large hotel after hotel after hotel after hotel. The sunbeds were quite crowded as well as the bed/pavilion structures. Hotel restaurants all the way along. We are leaving early to try Ubud then Gili. Fingers crossed
mary m,15 contributions,Dec 2019,Nusa dua beach is a little haven away from all the chaos of bali. It has a beautiful walking path along the side of the beach on one side and the other side are beautifully manicured gardens and resorts and also restaurants. We went jogging on the path every morning. There's hardly anyone hassling you to buy stuff.
Jayanth K,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2019,Nusa Dua Beach is one of the better maintained beaches of Bali.. there are options to play water sports.. be meticulous before getting into any watersport activity.  Bargain harder until they come down to your price.. they will eventually give in.. 
Jennifer B,"St. Mawgan, UK",Nov 2019,Beautiful beach to relax. Easy to walk through all the resorts along the beach front. It’s safe and friendly 
Fizzy6,Bibra Lake,Nov 2019,Beautiful beach with not too many hawkers and a lot of fun activities. Cold drinks served to your cabana and many spots to lounge on
Hmaspol,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"The beach where i stayed was not really clean and well arranged, maybe there was event during the weekend and too many people gather there."
valdowling,"Liverpool, UK",Dec 2019,Hawkers are well controlled and not the slightest bit intimidating.  Plenty of staff keeping the beach clean and tidy.
Old Pro,"Seattle, WA",Sep 2019,"In general, I felt Bali didn't have any particularly fantastic beaches . At least the ones I saw . This beach is a particularly it's not spectacular specially when compared to many of the beaches I've been to in the Caribbean. Kind of dull and without character and during the day turns into a big mud flap at low tide. So dull I didn't bother to take any pictures of it . But, I didn't come here for the beach oh, I came here to scuba dive. I took scuba tours two beaches that were very beautiful on penida Island. If beaches does what you like to do and don't particularly want an Indonesian style Hotel, pick a hotel on the west side of the island. It's much more crowded there and in my opinion not as nice but, there are nicer beaches."
Darren C,"Sentosa Island, Singapore",Nov 2019,"Beautiful & Cleanest beach I’ve ever experienced. Offers water sports, plenty of free loungers & shade. Push button beach service. Night time beach seats & open fires, with marshmallow toasting for the kids. Love it!!"
Brian F,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2019,"I wandered across to Nusa Dua to catch Devdan Show and I’m glad I did as, besides the show being great, there might otherwise be a risk that I would one day stay around here. This place is stale, whitewashed hole devoid of any Balinese or Indonesian culture, somewhat ironic given I’d come to Nusa Dua for a cultural dance show. Why anyone would travel to a another country and pay overs to stay in a place like this is beyond me. The beaches aren’t even that good. "
215ayen,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,This tranquil environment is good for honeymooner and family traveller . It is away from noises and busy/ crowded places . 
ekholland27,"Amersfoort, The Netherlands",Nov 2019,It is sandy but not a beach to swimm. With low tide you have to walk far and there are lots of rocks. Even with high tide water comes up only to just above knees and lots if weed and plastic. Not the picture post card you would expect
Allison Doyle,"Berkeley Vale, Australia",Nov 2019,"This has to be one of the cleanest beaches in Bali. Yes Bali has Ocean pollution problems, there are plastic bags floating everywhere! Really opens eyes to what we humans are doing to this planet.As far as that goes this beach is very clean and the beach sellers are smaller in numbers as well."
EveT205,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"On my own with friends, i may not come here. The beach, beach front dining, sunset all so romantic. Business meetings are good too, not much distractions "
anushka r,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,Nice clean beach. Probably not very suitable for swimming or surfing as where i stayed had a huge reef.
Michael Z,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"If you are a Bali virgin looking for a base camp to explore the island, Nusa Dua area is a safe bet.  Covered by white sand, Nusa Dua beach is a private beach shared by 4 waterfront hotels.  Hotel guest can go from up and down the entire beach, but only use amenities in your own hotel.  Some people swim and snorkel right off the beach, most people just kick back and do nothing.  You can watch sunrise from the beach but not the sunset, because sun sets on the other side of the island.  "
Angelo F,27 contributions,Oct 2019,Beautiful beach. Great view when having drinks at Kul Kul Bar. Family friendly beach. Nusa Dua is the ideal area for those that prefer peace and quiet. 
Escape45459895596,3 contributions,Nov 2019,Water is full of grass and sea things... In the evening is very crowded of local people. Not recommending
Drjon,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Aug 2019,We stayed at Hilton Hotel Bali Resort at Nusa Dua which was strategically situated along the beach Enjoyed the majestic and natural settings The clifftop view was mesmerising at night Most satisfying was this place it being  away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta areaTranquility was deafening 
royjava6,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Oct 2019,"When on Bali you will find the coolest beaches, world famous all around the world. Nusa Dua is the mostly quiet beaches area at East-Bali, so be prepared for the most beautiful sunrises. Because of the reef the tide is huge. With low tide you can walk to the reef, take care of the low depths in which sea urchins can be. I loved just to sit down in the water, relaxing and enjoy the cool breeze, the floating seaweed. And watch lots of relaxations, like the banana boat rides and other water sports activities (parasailing, surfing, jet-skiing, kite boarding, snorkeling etc.). Too quiet? Take a nice walk along the Nusa Dua Promenade. And have a snack or a drink at one of the many many terraces."
Departure56317057068,54 contributions,Nov 2019,"Nice beach with clear, warm water.  Low tide/high tide is extreme and rapid. The water recedes about 30 ft from high tide and you can walk out to the reef in ankle deep water, which isn’t the greatest when you need to cool off, but pretty cool to see."
Fiona C,"Stroud District, UK",Sep 2019,"Didn't swim in this much, lots dark muddy areas n seaweed, string under currents too. Better to swim in the pools provided. "
Jayne,4 contributions,Nov 2019,Great beach for kids and relaxing! There’s not too many waves so calm for the kids to play without having to worry. They keep it very clean and tidy. There’s some friendly locals selling merchandise but not too many to be annoying 
James M,"Edinburgh, UK",Nov 2019,"Beach nice and is cleaned outside major hotels only of old sea weed. Found plastic along coast of beach, once tide is out not easy to access water as tide goes out quite far. Worth a visit if you are a beach person."
travellor186403,"Coventry, UK",Oct 2019,"Shallow waters, seriously hot and high humidity however lots of trees to take shelter under. one of the best beaches we have ever been to. fully reccomend"
Galos_Airo,"Barcelos, Portugal",Oct 2019,"The beach is nice but the main problem is the dirty (plastic, seaweed, grass, etc:) doesn't make you welcome or comfortable for a swim or even enjoy the sunny days."
LUX ESCAPES 🌏 📸,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2019,What I love most is how sheltered and calm the beach is . Even wirh a large swell the outer reefs take all the waves so it is very safe for swimming and using a paddle board etc. If you go snorkeling you can see fish and lots of star fish in the sand.  You can walk right along the path and past all the different 5 star resorts. You can also eat or have a drink at them which is nice on a sunny day.  Summary- CleanSafeFreeYou won't get hassled on beach like in kuta 
Jeff C,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2019,"Relaxing with a warm welcome, lovely hotels along the beach walk with beautiful views out over the sea. Lots of places to stop for a drink or lunch . Bali collection a-good find. Shops and restaurants with many kinds of different foods at very reasonable price compared to the hotels but no sea views . "
Delson smith,5 contributions,Sep 2019,"a very beautiful place .. take a walk around, will really miss the beauty of this beach .. every time i come to bali this place i always visit"
Darren J,Bendigo,Oct 2019,"It's a nice beach, however the resorts dominate so although you can walk along the foreshore you can't use the facilities unless you buy a drink at the overpriced bars"
QuebecDiver,"Mount Royal, Canada",Oct 2019,"People from Bali are very aware of plastic pollution, they do their best to keep the place clean.Very nice people!"
Edward L,"Manila, Philippines",Nov 2019,Not so nice beach. Great for strolling but not for swimming. Low tide during late afternoon for instagram pictures 
Steven G,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,"Stayed in Inaya Putri Bali. Service is great, efficient and friendly. Spend the whole day in the hotel to enjoy the facilities. Kids love the pool so much they didn’t want to leave. "
Jean1823,"Nagoya, Japan",Oct 2019,"we can swim but the water wasn’t very clear when we went.. but some parts have clear water, maybe it’s because of the waves. nice and quiet where no vendors will keep disturbing you. it was very relaxing. we saw an angel fish swimming near the shore."
Theboardingpasss,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,"Just a lovely beach to chill out and relax. A lot of water activities around the area. I did scuba diving, make sure you bargain for a good price. "
Cioata Adina,"Iasi County, Romania",Oct 2019,"We descover a clean place, the  sea is clean. You have a place where you can buy drinks, you have toilets în that aeria. "
Shick59,"Warrnambool, Australia",Oct 2019,"If you are in this part of Bali then I'll recommend you visit the nusa Dua Beach. Lovely clean sand, clear water and the great walking Track along the beach"
SamueleSb,Luxembourg,Oct 2019,"Nisa Dua is the area of resorts in south Bali, so it's not really the authentic Bali, but it's a pleasent place to spend few days  relaxing on the beach. There are also many shops and restaurants and the big Bali Collection shopping centre with a huge selection of restaurants."
Strong_hoses,7 contributions,Oct 2019,It is simply so clean and amazing which shows how much care people of Bali Island have given to give us this satisfying experience. The water is crystal clear and the sand almost massages your feet. I highly recommend this beach to people of all ages and be sun safe!
Dr Parth,"Bhavnagar, India",Oct 2019,"You can enjoy water activities mainly in nusa Dua Beach in Bali. The paragliding, banana boat, scuba dive are the main attraction there.Be aware when you purchase any tour package because they might not include ticket for these activities. "
David S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,if you’re looking for a tranquility then go to Nusa Dua beach. The ambience is so calm & peace. I would love to see the wave coming to the shore. 
staniland66,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"Beautiful when the tide is in,  but a bit bleak when the tide is out. Very nice walk from the temple on the headland to Sofitel. Also a nice path at the back of the beach for cycling"
Lisha C.,"Las Pinas, Philippines",Sep 2019,I loved the walk to this beach. It is not as big or as well-kept as other popular beaches on the island but it is free and the walkway from the Grand Hyatt hotel was a great way to see the gardens and get to the beach front. You can also get here from the park neat the Waterblow site.
Nevena P,"Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia",Sep 2019,"The place overall it's very nice, a lot of nice hotels are around, but we did't have a very good expirience on the beach... First of all the wather was very dirty, it was hot but it wasn't nice to swim or enjoy in the wather which was that dirty. When we got out of the wather it was very windy so the sand was all over us, we were hoping that the wind will stop, but it didn't... The other thing that we didn't like was that you have signs on the beach that if you go in the wather you will swim on your own responsability, when you will see red flag on the beach it's high danger, the yellow flag shows medium danger, and the green flag shows no danger at all, but we were walking a lot and all we saw was the red flag, so it was not nice to swim in wather and know that there is a risk something to happen to you... If you are not swimer you can just seat and enjoy in the view, the beach it's beautifull in that point, nice white sand and blue sea..."
GassyDoha,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,No words to express the beauty of this heaven on earth.Several amenities nearby to compliment your appetite. Perfect for honeymooners and couples. 
Rob Ford,"Guildford, UK",Oct 2019,"Very clean beach - great for snorkelling and lots of bars and restaurants dotted along the beach. White sand, swimming area and not too rough. It’s very peaceful during the day and has atmosphere at night"

pmw,"Lindsay, Canada",Oct 2019,"A nice place to visit,strol,see some intreresting craftsl,do some markets and chat with some local people ndeatat a warung"
VFrequentTravellers,"Point Lonsdale, Australia",Oct 2019,We stayed here for the first time and enjoyed the beach. Quite clean all round. Also a lovely walk alongside the beach most of it under lovely tree canopies. Highly recommended!
JaseNZ26,"Auckland, New Zealand",Oct 2019,Pretty good beach I would say. Mostly people swimming outside the Inaya or Ayoda resorts. Colder than the hotel pools. Waves can pull you out a bit so be careful with children. See locals fishing out there as well. People surfing. Sand gets very hot during the day. Otherwise nice view and good to relax in front of with a beer.
R3N4,14 contributions,Oct 2019,"Whenever we come to Bali, we keep on staying at nusa dua. Either at sofitel, mulia, westin, clubmed or nusa due beach resort they situated next to each other on same stretch. You literally can walk from end to end the walking path is well kept and safe. Best for honeymooners or even family. "
shweta_jadhav,"Thane, India",Oct 2019,"Beautiful private beach, clean beach. Safe for travellers and good place to relax and unwind with few bars on the beach"
KodoDrummer,"Yekaterinburg, Russia",Oct 2019,This is the only beach I've been to where there is a dramatic difference between high and low tide. At low tide it didn't look so nice on the right hand side of our hotel. The overall quality of the beach is self evident from the many nicer hotels backing onto the beach.
murray_peter113,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,We chose to stay at aresort next to the beach. The main problem was that for the first week thw tide seemed to out for most of the day so it was not suitable for swimming but in the second week the high tide was in the middle of the day and we had a great swim. The sand is white unlike the busy Kuta side of the island. It is not really busy and a really relaxing way to spend your holidays layong around and observing the view. Evidently there were dangers like stepping on sea urchins at low tide but signs alerted you to the dangers. The low tide provided you with the opportunity to walk out to the edge of the reef and look in the rock pools. 
Petra L,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Nov 2018,"We have been in Bali in 1999, staying in Sanur and we said if we ever come again we will stay in Nusa Dua, because we liked the beach so much.20 years later we return , the beach is nothing like it was.The water was dirty, trash everywhere...Really sad.But Bali still awesome!"
Rosa V,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,"I was disappointed in the beaches,if there were nice beaches in Nusa Dua I certainly didn’t find them,looks lovely at a distance but not up close but at night with the lights and surrounding restaurants in Nusa Dua it looked a picture"
AirineH,5 contributions,Oct 2019,"Nusa dua beach always been our favourite escape from the hectic life in Jakarta. The beach is clean, private, the view is great. We can just sit down and lie back under the tree and sleep without thinking about anything, what a relax way of spending a day!"
Pakemon Bali Tour,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2019,this place will satisfy your mind when you are in this place ..... fresh air is almost without pollution you can enjoy here ... it's not wrong if you make this place as one of your travel agenda on the island of Bali ....
Wixters,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2019,"Coming from WA where we have excellent beaches it was hard to like this beach.  The sand is very corse under foot.  The water did seem clear and our son enjoyed playing in it, but it’s not the quality we are used to.  At least the bean bags and sun beds under the parasols were free (2.28 beach club) for Novotel guests.  I think it’s a cheek asking 33000 for a small bottle of water then adding %21 service charge on top."
Alison G,9 contributions,Sep 2019,Beautiful beach. Nice and quiet. Always  clean. Good choice of restaurants and cafes along the length.
Lina K,2 contributions,Sep 2019,"One of the rare beaches where you could actually swim in Bali. Even in low tide, it is still swimmable on some places. But, be there earlier, cause the sun sets before 17h and not in the ocean, as it sets in Kuta.Clean and lovely!"
Bogdan N,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"Went here with our kids. Place is clean, sand is nice, water is good. Best time to go is in the morning."

DShalders,"Glen Waverley, Australia",Sep 2019,Stayed at Novotel Nusa Dua and Visited the death with family of 5 being 2 adults and 3 kids 13-7 age.  First time to Bali and Nusa Dua and had to visit the beach to have a look. And we weren’t let down with beautiful views.  But it is very busy with the large resorts having 100’s of lounges on the beach.Wasn’t for us the foreshore is great for a walk.
Siby Tirado,"Lima, Peru",Mar 2019,"Crowded...too many tourist, but still beautiful landscapes and the locals of course more than friendly."
Timir P,"London, UK",Sep 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is a splendid location to spend the day. It is large and open with no restrictions along the way, each hotel along the beach has loungers which are kept away and don't interrupt a pleasant walk. The beach is kept clean my the diligent staff of the hotels, and is a beautiful place to witness a sunrise."
Dolman333,124 contributions,Sep 2019,A lovely beach with a giant shallow area which stays in even at low tide and warms up to a great temperature for children to play in.The blowhole is right next door but only works closest to high tide.

Craig D,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,Have been here for a week. Went to the beach at high tide every afternoon. Beach is cleaned daily and there is no swell or surf. Grandchildren all four and under and totally safe. Would give this beach 11/10!!

AMCW2013,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,We have spend just over a week in Nusa Dua staying at the Grand Hyatt. Beautiful beach which is well kept outside of the Grand Hyatt. Lots of rocks to walk over at low tide. Nice to swim in. Was jellyfish season when we were there but swam with no issues. Beautiful beach to watch sunrises. 
Radhika S,"London, UK",Sep 2019,Lovely sandy beaches with beautiful warm clear waters. Could do nice water sports here including jet skiing with lovely views!
Carol Webb,"Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2019,"Not your busy hectic beach like kuta.Here you can relax and just watch the world go by. Mostly accessible by hotels alongvfb the beach but there is a hub of activity during the day past the St Regis hotel. Great cafes, and onbthe beach massages which are pretty good! "
ludu_mada,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Sep 2019,"I liked going to Nusa Dua Beach for 2 reasons: it was quiet (no music) and the beach wasn’t all full of sunbeds. We went specifically to Novotel’s beach for that.In the morning the wawes were very powerfull so there was no chance of swimming, but after 2 pm it was ok.Also, there were some seaweeds but there were people gathering it from the beach. "
GnM-Burra,"Canberra, Australia",Aug 2019,"We found a great driver while catching the free bus from The Bali Connection back to our resort. His name is Putu and his WhatsApp number is +62 819-9904-0601His brother, Eddie, collected us in  a brand new air conditioed car and  drove us to the Water Temple, back through Ubud for lunch and then across to Sanur on our way home.Cost for the day was most reasonable and about a third of the day rate offered by the resort."
Chris Bacon,10 contributions,Sep 2019,Great sandy beach lots of fun walking in the sea a beach well worth visiting lots of place to sit and relax also to have fun amongst the waves
Neil K,20 contributions,Aug 2019,if you love sun you will love Nusa Dua.  If you are one of those that love sun but stay in the shade you will love being on the Nusa Dua Beach at the Nusa Dua Beach and Resort Hotel.  The beach is beautiful.  Water clean and employees just perfect.  You will learn to love them all as we have over the years.  Try here and you will see just how wonderful life can be.
Dario,2 contributions,Sep 2019,Never saw a nicer beach without water. By 11am the water is going back (so anything what stay is stinking seatrash) and come again sometimes in the night. Swimming is possible from 5am to 11am
Ellen P,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"Went here one late afternoon after having a spa at the nearby shopping center. It was low tide when we were there, so we just stroll along the beach. There were some people  jogging & cycling. There are seating along certain stretch of the beach, as well as some big restaurants & a beach club. The weather is nice & breezy in late afternoon. Good for relaxing."
Pedro_Collins68,"Box Hill, Australia",Aug 2019,"This was our first visit to Nusa Dua beach. We have been to Seminyak in a previous trip so we were so surprised to see that the beach was so beautiful to swim in. There are water sports on the beach, people playing volleyball and a beautiful atmosphere. It’s a must to visit. I had some preconceived ideas that it would be expensive but it really wasn’t. And in some cases the shopping was cheaper than Seminyak. Would visit again. Especially with young children and families. "
greenmanners,4 contributions,Sep 2019,"I had a few swims in Nusa Dua this year and on a holiday last year.  While the swimming is good and the snorkelling is amazing (lionfish, angelfish, honeycomb moray eel etc) the sea is full of plastic and other rubbish.     "
Big Raj,3 contributions,Sep 2019,"The beach is amazing to look at. The water is so blue and clean. The beach itself has lovely hot sand beneath your feet. The time we went, wasn’t busy at all which meant we had our own spot to relax on. Definitely worth a trip to this beach. Restaurants on the beach sideline, but limited amount so more are needed."
melaniew762,"Dallas, TX",Sep 2019,"Great for runs along the seaside, lounging in sun chairs or swimming! Beautiful beach with a nice boardwalk as well. "
Village49,"Bellevue, WA",Mar 2019,Wonderful beach to enjoy. Overall pretty clean for Bali. Be sure to bring your sun tan lotion. Nice restaurants near by. 
somalghamdi,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2019,I loved this place because the atmosphere is very romantic and very quiet with no noise of the city❤️❤️
Graeme W,15 contributions,Jul 2019,"I recently swam at the Nusa Dua beach adjacent to the Grand Hyatt Resort. The combination of a protective reef, warmer water and relative absence of under tows made my water experience a memorable one. The water & sands are pristine & the gentle on shore breezes were very relaxing and perfect for the sport of kite flying. A short walk to the north takes you to the blowhole point where spectacular waves crash onto the rocks & explode high into the air to the delight of the many onlookers.  There are quite a lot of shade trees along the foreshore if sunbathing is not your thing which incidentally are populated by many cheeky squirrels who demand to be fed despite the practice being warned against by numerous signs in the area. To sum up, this is a beautiful clean beach which will not disappoint."
Michael mcamis,4 contributions,Aug 2019,Great place for families or solo trip. The hotel is very accommodating. Cathey PACIFIC/DRagon AIRLINES lOST oR went tHOUGH my luggage   mY sEIZURE mEDICATION cAME UP MISSING. they have a  DR at the resort that was helpful. BEAUTIFUL VIEWS. right next to the beach. prenty to do great shopping Just down the street as well
Simon B,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Sep 2019,"A lovely walk on wide paved path that runs behind Nusa Dua beach is terrific experience. Whether watching action (water sports) on water, tourist play/relax on beach or the amazing resorts/gardens. Best times around dawn and dusk."
Greg W,"North Sydney, Australia",Sep 2019,"Probably one of very few beaches I would actually swim in. It’s clean and the waves manageable for those of us that is not into surfing. Also the Hotels hire people to continually clean the stretch of beach so you don’t get to see rubbish, plastics, or even seaweed. A must go to swimming area if you are close by. "
Carlos L,"Lisbon, Portugal",Sep 2019,"small, windy and almost always low tidelots of boats arriving and a smell of gasoline when they arrive"
Sheila W,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Aug 2019,"This beach is the one of the best - pristine and looks fabulous but no-one on it!! Not sure whether it was just the area we staying at but the sand was so fine you couldn't walk on it - deserted, everyone around the pool."
Glenn T,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,A clean beach with a big rocky area to explore during low tide. Nice and clean and hence good for running as well.
Silvia Kezia,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"I came here twice and the perfect time is the second one, not too crowded and so calm. See the blue sea and it was high enough."
Jude-escapes,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2019,"Some were snorkeling, paddle boarding and a few surfing... I just strolled and enjoyed the peninsula with its views and photo opportunities. there’s a blowhole also."
dmcallis73,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,Being secluded makes the beach really nice and clean water quality is great compared to busier beaches closer to main tourist areas like Seminyak.
Niknut57,"Mildura, Australia",Sep 2019,"This beach changes every hr. You have the view of Mt Agung, you have an enormous tide that goes out 500 mt, warm water for swimming or snorkelling (not much fish) and some waves to have fun with. Not far away you can do all the water activities like Jet ski, parasailing, banana ride etc etc. Most of the beach is quiet, tranquiel and the sand is great."
Der_Macher68,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2019,I nice spot in Bali if you want to relax on a nice white sand beach and swimming in a clear water.I'd reccomend to stay more towards the Inaya hotel where the beach is larger and less impacted by low tide in the afternoon.There is all along the way a walking/jogging path where you can train or just enjoy the sea breezeIt is a quite and safe place so don't expect to much night activities.Close by there is Bali Collection where everyone can find the best restaurant to fit own tastes
gwalior95,"Edmonton, Canada",Aug 2019,it is a wonderful sandy beach . kids loved to play in sand and water . there are water activities available . we were staying at the Inaya Resort  so enjoyed the beach which was clean . there were times when there were high tides and the life guards put out the red flags .  
Bhavs,"Greater London, UK",Aug 2019,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt and went to the Nusa dua beach and it was absolutely fantastic it was lovely and clean. The sand was so nice and soft and the kids loved playing in it. There was no litter at all and it was safe for them to play in unlike some beaches this was an amazing beach to build a sandcastle on and we all had great fun doing so. There was also a swing on the beach which was very popular with all the guests young and old. Well worth a visit if you are in Bali, one of the nicest beach we have been to and stayed at. "
Stuart Priestley,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,This was our first visit to Bali and Nusa Dua is simply stunning and a perfect location to explore Bali from. 
CanadaWestCoast,"Vancouver, Canada",Aug 2019,Nusa Dua  is a great place to stay. The beach offers a few kilometers of sandy beaches to walk up on. The hotels in the area are excellent stays and often just a walk to the beach or offer a shuttle service. We stayed at the courtyard by Marriott which was absolutely fantastic!
Lorraine22021968,"Kirkcaldy, UK",Aug 2019,"Lovely beach with nice sands to walk along, when the tide is out u can walk for ages although the water is fairly shallow "
Fotis Damas,1 contribution,Jul 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is glorious , white sand, deep and long.It’s safe to say that bali beaches have an identity of their own and can leave its imprints on your hearts"
Dean Manu,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"This a nice beach in south of bali. You can relaxing your self and enjoy a Long Beach with the white sand, surfing and another activity"
wanderlust,46 contributions,Aug 2019,"The low tide on Nusa Dua gets so low that you can't even swim in the water anymore. You have to go so far out. Also it's all lined up with fancy resorts, so not a great place to chill if you want food options that aren't extremely expensive. Definitely not the best beach to go to in Bali unless you're staying in one of those resorts. but yeah, low tide (like all afternoon) makes the ocean unswimmable. "
Valentina C,"Santorini, Greece",Aug 2019,Not Bali best place to stay too much quiet. Seems to be better Kuta if you are not travelling with children and family.Beach nothing special as the ocean do not allow to swim so pool is needed.Hotel and accomodations expensive.
AliMaddo,Cambridge,Aug 2019,"We enjoyed this beach, the waves break far out leaving it calm and safe for the children. My only thing would be to say to the local community and hotels in the beach to please have a concerted effort to clean up the plastic daily, if not twice daily to take the plastic out of the ocean and stop producing plastic in the island too. "
Dr Awesome,"Richmond, New Zealand",Aug 2019,Beautiful beach but sadly let down by the activities of humans. The staff do their best to clear rubbish but it's sad to see the lack of respect for the planet. The ocean was full of debris and litter (plastic mainly).
Laci_Sz,"Budapest, Hungary",Aug 2019,"It's a nice beach, good for families. Bit overcrowded and overpriced as the majority of bars and grills are the property of top resort hotels in Nusa Dua. Anyway - worth a visit."
Gina P,"Sunninghill, UK",Jul 2019,Lovely beach in Bali.  Very touristy area but still a lovely holiday area for relaxation.  We stayed at the Westin and highly recommend.
Judy H,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,We walked along the beach yesterday and marvelled  at its beauty and tranquility. It is also very clean. We stopped at one of the bistros and enjoyed the scenery with a refreshing fruit drink.
andiswa❤️,South Africa,Aug 2019,It was a very gorgeous beach. Lots of activities to do for all ages. I would highly recommend visiting this beach. 
James N,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Good beach. Warm waters although strong currents in places. Coral/reef just off shore where the crashing waves are. Beautiful tropical fish- Moray eel, Angel fish, rass, clownfish. Just off coast. Wonderful."
Kristin J,"Tallinn, Estonia",Aug 2019,"Really clean beach with warm water. Sunbathing chairs owned by hotels, so if you want them you should pay. Price range 200 000-400 000 rupiah. A lot of water activities to do."
zoe z,9 contributions,Aug 2019,"We like the peacefulness there, beautiful scenery, cool breeze, smooth sand. You won't get bunch of people lying around in the background of your photos. LOL"
Endru_06,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2019,So relaxing. Beach is clean. Not so crowded. Easy to find. Come for many time already. Very nice place
Rafael Hengky,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali hotel voucher for sale. A 2 nights stay at Luxury Room with Pool access. Inclusive of full board meal, access to Club Millesime, Balinese Massage, Bicycle tour, Archery activity.It is said that the voucher worth 25,000,000 IDR. I would like to sell it for 10,000,000 IDR. I got from prizes and not intended to use it."
Sailesh S,"Stanhope Gardens, Australia",Aug 2019,Been here twice at Novotel Nusa Dua private beach. Love the water and beach compared to Legian and Kuta. It is kept reasonably clean. There is a slight current in some places but water is refreshing and great to swim in.
DocC27,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jun 2019,This is the perfect area to go for water sports.We stayed at Kuta and Nusa dua is very close. lovely packages for all kinds of watersports.
marianne s,Milan,Jul 2019,"beautiful area with excellent Hotels and quiet area...after visiting Kuta, Seymiak, Denpasar are we glad to go too this area"
BillUK32,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Go for a long long walk early morning to see the sun rise or later at sunset. You can walk 5km around it and back. I prefer this to Kuta, Lovina beach and Seminyak."
Maria P,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"Spent some time at the Mulia Resort but also swam and snorkelled at the beach.  The water was warm, the beach had quite a few bits of sharp coral but was reasonably clean.  There were lots of fish whilst snorkelling but the locals were feeding them bread.  Probably not the best diet for the fish.  Pity.  I should mention the loud, arrogant, partying European tourist from the resort but it was NYE after all."
ziga v,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Aug 2019,The beach and the whole ITDC area was a bit of a let down for me as apart from the top hotels the moment you step outside the hotel area the surroundings are not what you would expect from a world class destination. It all looks a bit half completed and missing the key details.The beach itself is nice to look at and stroll around it but for swimming not really good as the waves are high and the water is not so clean so if you stay in one of the resorts you will swim in the pools for sure. Also the offer of the beach clubs really not on high level so again in the resorts its all great but outside not much.
buddy m,13 contributions,Oct 2018,Having fun under the sun was the best thing to do in Bali with their fun water activities especially the banana boat riding and parasailing. It is a must try/things to do in Bali.
Christine Shelley,Perth,Jul 2019,Beach is sandy and the areas around the private beach clubs are kept nice and clean. Good path at top of beach for easy for walking and nice and shady.
DianaPei,"Shanghai, China",Jul 2019,"The beach is beautiful, but the water is not clean. It's not fine. white sand. There are too many stones, shells and seaweeds etc. on the beach, which makes playing at the seaside not so fun. We kept stepping on stones while at the water, and that was quite painful somtimes and could hurt kids."
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,Beautiful beach with white sands...lots of high end hotels in the area...things are expensive  in that area....we went to do the water sports in that area.
Razor Ray,"County Meath, Ireland",Jul 2019,A beautiful clear water beach with clean sandy beaches. The tide goes out about half a mile leaving pockets of warm clear water with starfish and other marine life in them. Absolutely beautiful. 
Umang A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,This white sand beach is the most beautiful beach in Bali. This place is beat for long walks and relaxing your your soul
Nicole W,"East Victoria Park, Australia",Jul 2019,First time stay for my daughter and I at Nusa Dua. Highly recommend this side of Bali. Very peaceful and beautiful. We will also stay in legion this trip but so glad to have come to Nusa Dua.
exact,"Drammen, Norway",Jul 2019,"not overcrowdedprotected by a reef so not big waves all the timepossible both to use if you want to have your towel just in the sand and possible to rent sunchairs in a couple of public areas, many beach clubs that belong to the hotels and are for their guestsbut no problem at all to find a lot of space can be a strong under currant when the waves get over the reef"
John E,"San Luis Obispo, CA",Jul 2019,"The water temperature was very warm. We did notice plastics floating in the water. The sand is very nice. Overall, a very good beach with many hotels."
nickS910HM,Cobham,Jul 2019,"Peaceful, nice sand and water is clean and good temperature. Laguna Beach hotel is a great location on the beach and offer a good service with drink and food for hotel guests. The beach sellers are also not too much, they want to sell you something but are never too pushy."
gazca,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,Nusa Dua beach is clean and safe with calm water. Great restaurants and bars along the beachfront. Great for couples and families.
BlueAnto,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,"Great location, friendly and very helpful locals. Balinese people mostly are quite hospitable. Definitely will be returning "
Alberto M,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"If you are looking for crystalline water this is not the place. The beach is good if you enjoy water activities like banana, sail parachuting, etcThe area to swim is pretty limited and the water not clean.The beach in front of the hotels is kept clean so people can enjoy nice sunbathing and use hotel services"
juvalesm,"Navi Mumbai, India",Apr 2019,"The beach is crowded by foreign tourists. It is clean somewhere, but seems polluted a little. Water sports are available. Overall nice experience walking on the shore."
Deanne,"Coulsdon, UK",Jul 2019,Went snorkelling here which was a total waste of time as there’s no fish in this area because of the amount of water sports and boats tearing around. Went in the water and my hair came out sticky?? Over crowded and full of rip offs. 
jen p,14 contributions,Jun 2019,Really thought this would be uninteresting and something I didn’t need to do because I have Florida and California beaches afterall.  I had a flight though and the hotels here are super super close to airport - 6 dollar ride. I had a early morning flight so I booked a room at the Luxury collection and it was a huge hit!  I wish we would have stayed longer here as the hammocks in the sea and the peaceful water and the swings in the sea that you can swing on are just exquisite!!
OGGI56,"Bathgate, UK",Jul 2019,"As a group of 3 adults and one 2yr old we had a fab time at the Nusa Dua beach hotel. The staff, facilities , restaurants and location was excellent. We would definitely recommend and if the opportunity arises would definitely go back. A good time was had by all."
1281deepa,"Dallas, TX",Jul 2019,The sunrises from temple statue and the view is totally worth it .. grand Hyatt also rents kite if you wish to fly kite 
Anthony H,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,"The only unenjoyable thing about doing Water Sports in Nusa Dua is negotiating the prices with the operators. There are dozens of companies lined up along the beach, one after the other, all after your business. They vast majority of them will charge you as much as they can and make the whole process very confusing. The 1st thing you need to do is research your prices. We found some great prices on the Wira Water website and we used them as a negotiating tool. The prices are less than half of what operators will try and charge you. The 2nd thing you need to know is that if you let your taxi or shuttle driver enter the car park of any business, they will get a 5% cut of whatever you spend. Tell them to park outside and send someone off to talk to the various operators until they find the right one. There were 9 people in our group. We negotiated the internet prices with a further 10% off the prices found on the internet and no additional credit card fees (usually an extra 4%). The whole group had a 15 minute jet ski, tandem parasail, banana boat and four people did the flying fish. In total Cost was 2,500,000 IDR or around $250AUD. Very reasonable! Also the operators were happy because we didn’t book it through the internet agency and therefore cut out an extra middle man. Last time we were in Bali we all wanted to go parasailing and booked through an agency in Seminyak. When we arrived at Nusa Dua they told us that it was too windy and they weren’t doing parasailing. We asked for a refund and they said they couldn’t and we had to pick another activity."
ReidHouse1984,"Vancouver, Canada",Jul 2019,Beautiful place. Our hotel offered free sunbeds and we loved just chill and get tan right on the beach.
meski4,"Victoria, Australia",Jul 2019,"A beautiful beach for rock pools at low tide and swimming and snorkelling at high tide. Warm water and fine sand. Unfortunately, there's a lot of rubbish in the water."
Shannon_Perth,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,Great little beach with chairs and lounges. Great walk along the beach and check out off resorts. The ocean is clean and sand is soft. Gets really busy as well.
Abu Wandi Samer,"Amman, Jordan",Jul 2019,"The beach is prefect balance between shades and sunny area. Nusa Dua beach was very clean and so pretty. Beautiful clear water. You can walk for kilometres along the beach, so lovely. Really nice beaches ."
Erika V,33 contributions,Jul 2019,"Nice beach if you like big waves, go and try it, few people and clean place. Bring bananas and fruits so you can share with the monkeys that runs freely."
Natty,World,Jul 2019,We are like Nusa Dua Beach very clean here. You can walk on the with out the rock. We enjoy it. We will come back here agian.
KodoDrummer,"Yekaterinburg, Russia",Jul 2019,"We found the beach areas in front of the major hotels to be very nice, but not well-maintained everywhere. We got up early to see the amazing sunrise views. In the mid-afternoon, we had massages on the beach, but further away from the water."
Marie G,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,We enjoyed walking the beach here. We didn't go swimming.The beach was very quiet. Hotels have their sun loungers under trees on Beachfront. Also had a big swing on the beach. Lovely place to spend a few hours here. Very Relaxing.
Roger K,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,The guests at the hotels that are on the beach can retreat to these for shade but if you’re visiting forget it. It’s a nice beach but no respite from sun or wind. I don’t know if I will come back
grumpee-58,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Clean sandy beach with a few large waves, great to stroll along at night.Gets a bit crowed onshore during the day."
Gian B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,I have now been to Nusa Dua for the last 4 years. The beach is amazing. You can just walk kilometres and pop in all different places as you stroll. I always recommend a Lemon Radler - great beer. The ocean beach is great to swim in. Plenty photo opportunities.
71wendyannm,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"The beaches are nicer to swim in here, & much cooler due to the lovely breezes. The sand was nice & clean out the front of the hotel with nice sun lounges available. "
paulaustralia2018,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,Beach is nice and clean. The staff at The Westin cleaned and raked it everyday to ensure it is pristine.
Travel Ninja,5 contributions,May 2019,Most beaches are dirty and unclean at Bali And some are rocky but Mont you can’t swim in It’s nice for a walk in the evening or morning 
Jeroen B,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"Lovely beaches all around. Weather is awesome. Lots of stuff to do on the water. We did jet ski, banana boat, and there is parasailing, Jetton, and so on"
Courtney M,"Leesburg, VA",Jul 2019,Nusa Penida is surrounded by resorts with nice sand. There is an excellent jogging path to run about 5k in the mornings before it gets hot. I recommend checking out the water hole before the crowds come. There was a group of people doing their morning yoga there too. Different experiences probably depend on which resort you pick. We stayed at the St. Regis and it is very quiet and serene. This must be a hot wedding spot because there were many. Seeing the bride and groom getting their pictures taken on the beach was fun. 
Aruna K,"Navi Mumbai, India",Dec 2018,"very beautiful beach, clean and clear waters wonderful way to spend the whole day at the beach with family on vaction."
Daniel S,"Geneva, Switzerland",May 2019,Synthetic little balls everywhere and a lot of plastic washing up unfortunately.Could be better . Hotels need to do more to clean it up.
BoyoChris,"Sunderland, UK",Jun 2019,Ocean as abvoe was see through. no dirt etc. Waves were not bad in june either. 10/10 beach! we stayed at laguna.
JPadman,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Overall it is a very windy beach, rocky, heavy sand, lots of seaweed, very strong currents and the waves can hurt you even if you are an experienced swimmer."
chauhanLondon,"London, UK",Jun 2019,"We stayed at a hotel on Nusa Dua beach.Went on a 2 hour hour morning walk along the beach daily where we saw the beautiful sunrise and sunsets.It’s clean, water is warm and the perfect, idyllic place to relax "
Halil,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Jun 2019,We spent three days on the beach. Even if it is tide down period you can enjoy there with your family. I highly recommend to wear aquashoes especially for the children.
Suman Raj,"Kathmandu Valley, Nepal",Jun 2019,"Early morning with your camera, Nusa Dua beach is the perfect spotlight to be at. The water is relatively calm. There are some huts for shade to relax. We didn't stay long but compared to the nearby beaches that we encountered, it's a nice place with somber view."
Suesteve33,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019,Love Nusa Dua beach.Clean compared to many other holiday spots.The hawkers tend to leave you alone once you say no thanks.Do get sick of wedding photographers and their fAKE posing clients everywhere you look.
Wojciech I,3 contributions,Jun 2019,"Lovely, clean, safe beach. Safe to have a swim, although waves quite big. Many places to stop and have  a drink. "
Kanga70,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Excellent area for sunbathing, swimming and enjoying drinks, snacks etc from the Cafe/Bar ....  whilst this Beach area is attached to the Sofitel Hotel, it is open to the general public...."
John Y,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2019,What a wonderful discovery. White sand aquamarine ocean and not a piece of plastic in sight. A wonderful beach to spend the day.
Rachel R,4 contributions,Jun 2019,Amazing !!! Absolutely picture perfect. The water was crystal clear. Can get a little rough depending on the tide but that never stopped us going at all
Tom H,"Ubud, Indonesia",Jun 2019,Nusa Dua is a lot more relaxed than Kuta. It seems less overwhelmingly tourist trappy. Many high and medium end resort hotels.
LairdofDenny,"Denny, UK",Jun 2019,"This long and beautiful beach looks great until you walk along the area where the water reaches the land. The amount of plastic and rubbish is upsetting and spoiling what should be an accessible paradise beach. The staff maintaining the beach are fighting  a losing battle.  They do sweep and collect what they can daily but sadly the volume is overwhelming.  Not the fault of the small number of hardworking people trying their best to fight a tide of rubbish and plastic which is an international problem.  We all need to do more to stop this - I did see a tourist, a dad with two young children, each pick up at least three pieces of plastic rubbish and carry them off the beach and put them into a bin - lesson to be learned. "
Mats D,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Jun 2019,The food was of excellent quality and the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. We really felt they made the extra effort to make sure we were satisfied (which was very much achieved). The live music and magician were especially enjoyable and made the lunch a special and memorable occasion. 
andyandrews,"Sittingbourne, UK",Jun 2019,"Most people will have access to swimming g pools.  The beach is divided into sections for Hotels.  It is fine, sandy and easily accessible but it it VERY shallow which precludes swimming. Looks nice, is clean and a pleasant place to unwind ( but not for swimming)"
Reece B,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2019,Having seen some of the other beaches around main tourist areas of Bali I find the beaches here are much more cleaner. Very relaxing and don't have people pouncing on you to buy stuff.Loved it.
wolfsbite,"Hobart, Australia",Jun 2019,This beach is nothing to rave about. It is protected by an enclosed reef over which the surf breaks making quite a picture.The sand is very coarse and soft making it hard to walk on.In the mornings a team of beach cleaners remove seaweed from the waters edge and bury it in the sand.  They also remove the countless plastic bottles that were washed up overnight and presumably send it off for recycling.A nice beach to look at but I wouldn’t swim in the water.
Andowhite,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is just beautiful..,the water is clean and clear ... the workers are constantly out cleaning all the beach front even of leaves from the trees ..  I just hope us as tourist respect the beauty enough to make sure we leave it clean "
quito2003,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"Depending on which part of the Nusa Dua beach you go to, generally there is really quite a fait bit of rubbish swept up shore. Private beaches in front of hotels or resorts would have cleaners sweeping up the garbage every day. It is reallt a pity, but it reflects the state of pollution around that area."
sallynatanegara,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jun 2019,So crowded now. I love it back in 2000s when it was still exclusive. I dont really like the Bay area full of broke closing clubs and all.
imfussy1,"Limavady, UK",Jun 2019,"An excellent hotel, immaculately clean. Staff are fantastic, so friendly and helpful. There was a huge range of breakfast dishes to choose from and facilities to avail of. This hotel has something for everyone. A very peaceful and tranquil place to stay, would love to have been there longer. "
Jason,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2019,"Huge beach lined by many premium hotels, a lot of beach areas close to the hotels are private. The ocean is fairly clean a waters are calm, although the tide is substantial. A great walking/riding path running the entire length of the beach."
khanh ly,10 contributions,Jun 2019,Beach of Bali Nusa Dua really so beautiful and nice place for couples go to travel together or family have a good holiday together! Indonesian very friendly and kind!
490billyp,"Auckland, New Zealand",May 2019,It is best to swim at high tide as the water is less than knee deep at low tide - take a hotel towel and enjoy
Harry,"Linz, Austria",Jun 2019,"Our hotel was located at this beach and we loved it. It is long, clean and offers peaceful shallow waters as well as crazy high waves!"
Katheryn F,"Gainesville, VA",Jun 2019,"This is one of the cleanest beaches that we have been to in Bali.  We always stay at the Westin Nusa Dua which has a private beach. However, all along Nusa Dua, the beach is clean and beautiful."
Battista_R_K,jakarta,Jun 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is getting more natural year by year. We can see more and more fish swimming around near the beach. Hopefully the people around also can get better by using the trash bin, especially for plastic waste."
Dawn L,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"This is a clean, beautiful beach! It has really fine sand. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt so we had access to the hotel's private beach. We love it! "
cattloverss,"Minneapolis, MN",May 2019,"The beach is very calm and not crowded, the water temperature is just right, not too cold or hot. I enjoyed swimming in the ocean very much, the beach is very clean."
AndreasHopkinsMailbox,4 contributions,Jun 2019,"Best beach in Bali in my opinion. Cristal clear water, golden sand. Not many people around you. It's perfect place to spend vacations."
Sdhawan61,Noida,Jun 2019,"This place is mainly for water sports and if this is ur first visit than u need to be careful with rates as any kind of rates and bargain will be offered. Very commercial on some activities and very nice and helpful in some. Here are some dos and dontsCarry local cash in abundance as discounts is on cash and how much u can bargain Carry ur own gopro camera and other camera  if u can for activities , they use cannon hotshot for photos Photo charges are high if used their.  services Cleanliness and hygiene is an issue in some activities like diving. Watch out for   mouth gear .Flyboat, jetski, bali ocean waker, donut ride, para sailing , diving is what we did.Donut guy was rude but staff making it do was helpful.Please be ready to bargain tickets to max based on nos of people , they can bring it down by idr 1000000 easily."
bjoliverio,"Atlanta, GA",May 2019,"We saw this beach from the Nusa Dua hotel and it was a disaster.  Maybe it was low tide but still not at all like the pictures. Or maybe it is just from this hotel.  The hotel does not clean the debris on the beach in front of their hotel either.  A lot of beaches in Indonesia are public beaches, but most hotels still cleaned the area in front of their hotel and then raked it.  Not the Nusa Dua hotel, it is a highly distressed property.  Be very careful."
Keely S,"Cookeville, TN",Aug 2018,Wonderful place to visit.  The people are so nice and friendly.  The beaches are stunning and the rooms were spacious and very clean. All services available on the property.  The tour guides were very nice and the best was Maudi. poolside service was excellent.
Saratasty,France,Jun 2019,"They say it is public but actually it is private because all the resorts are there, meaning every hotel has its private beach ! you still have the right to seat on the sand ( thanks god.. lol)  It’s beautiful but full of tourists "
111aor,"London, England, United Kingdom",Jun 2019,Visited Nusa Dua at the end of two week visit. Beach lovely and lots of sand although sand is difficult to walk on closer to the sea as you sink deeply making it hard to enter the water. Outlook beautiful with boats to watch and hotels have access to their own part of the beach. When tide goes out quite rocky with pools to look for small fish and anemones. Walk along to see the turtle nest. 
Muhamad Idris Satriyo Nugroho,"Blitar, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"The beach in the Nusa Dua area is very clean because it is surrounded by luxury resorts, every day the staff cleans leaf leaves, the security in the Nusa Dua area is also very guaranteed because it is surrounded by 24 hour CCTV, so the beach in Nusa Dua is clean, glass really for vacation / honeymoon even prewedding"
Andre Cornelius S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"I visited Novotel Beach Club, its very easy to access when you stay at Novotel, they have shuttle service every 15 minutes and they give you beach towel (free of charge).The Beach and the sea are very relaxing. Don't forget to put sun screen or tanning oil."
KJ1711,"London, UK",Jun 2019,"Huge, gorgeous, a wonderful beach to spend time on. The water is nice and shallow and perfect for children. "
DarelleNg,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"Nice beach, white sand and perfect sunrise. I walk along the beack from Sofitel to St Regis every morning."
Krishna,"Bengaluru, India",May 2019,We were there during 22 to 28 may for family vacation.Went to the beach many times. Also had a yoga class at the beach.My son had his beach massage.We also went there few times to swim and during walk/run in the morning.Great view and ambience. Shallow waters and white sand where one could spend many hours.Since we had to go out to visit  other places in bali we could not spend as much time we originally planned. 
Made Wiasta,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",May 2019,One of the oldest hotel in Nusa Dua. The location is wonderful. The beach is really clean and the room has large size!
Vin Dosa,"Hyderabad, India",May 2019,Its a beautiful beach with blue skies and lot of activities to do. One day is probably good enough to complete all the activities. We just loved it there. We had so much fun with family. There were hoards of visitors trying out various activities at the beach too.
Himawan Widyandaru,"Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Family kind of beach, the waves is not that big compared to other beaches but the sand itself is a bit coarse. A lot of high end resort but it feels nice to hang out under the sun and relax a bit. Entry fee is about 5000 rupiah which still reasonable thinking about the surrounding posh areas"
Indra,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Good place, could be for sun rise and sunset. It's quite far from home but kinda worth it. The kids love it, a great day"
Chockiechic,96 contributions,May 2019,"As we were staying at the Marriott Nusa Dua Gardens Resort, we decked out at the Marriott’s private beach area. The waves at this beach is very good for beginner surfers. Surf lessons, wake boarding, jet ski, and various sea sports activities are easily available along the beach. Little ones will have a blast at low tide - they can go crab hunting and also catch sea stars and sea slugs. There are no lack of masseuse combing the area if you fancy a massage by the beach. "
victor056,"Derby, UK",May 2019,Walked down about 15 minutes from our hotel at the quieter end of Nusa Dua. It’s a lovely beach but can be a little busy where most of the 5 star hotels are situated.
Pamela M,"North Haven, Australia",May 2019,Thoroughly enjoyed swim at the beach paid 50;000 rph for beach bed which is ok.  Enjoyed milk shake from small cafe and swam in clean ocean. Go visit
Darshan L Trivedi,21 contributions,May 2019,"Very clean beach,  clear and calm waters and perfect place to spend time with loved ones..... Not very busy as other beaches... A very good option if planning for a romantic Getaway, "
ronnieboye,4 contributions,May 2019,"Perfect!! Clean and not crowded.. crystal clear, water and beautiful hotels along the way .. well lit path way.. "
MalcH,"Loughborough, UK",Apr 2019,Nice beach that goes on for miles and good place to watch the sunrise. Sand itself was clean but quite coarse in places. Sea very clear but just be careful of currents and sea urchins when the tide is out. Mainly links the large five star hotels but small cafes/beach clubs can be found along with water sports and of course the obligatory massage ladies. 
Tdope,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",May 2019,Water is smooth and good to swimThere are sea weeds which our resort used to remove every morning.  There are people who would sell stuff and rides. negotiate and bargain. 
Phillip's Sanjay Divaker,"Secunderabad, India",May 2019,"Courteous staff..Good food....Water front...Good Dal Makani...Indian food, Amazing Sea Food restaurant IKAN"
Prakash K,"Kathmandu, Nepal",May 2019,Very good beach with clear water. But there is a problem that garbage comes to beach with waves. But people are aware there and they always do attempt to clean it. Me and my wife walked kilometers in the morning of our stay. Very good feeling. But due to cloudy weather we could not enjoyed sunrise.
rangiorachap,108 contributions,May 2019,"A real gem. Right beside the Club  Med On the beach walk, and before the beach club and Sofitel beside the marine police you have this massage place. Quite unassuming and they offer massage and hair braiding etc but remi who was our masseuse was amazing. Lovely ladies all of the. And we would highly recommend. We had 3 massages each with Remi. As good a quality as the hotel ones ."
LucioHolder1983,2 contributions,May 2019,Beautiful view and perfect sand to walk on. Our hotel was just  in few steps away and im so happy to be there. Will recommend this place for all my friends.
silki_milki,"Düsseldorf, Germany",May 2019,"The beach at nusa dua is really beautiful. The sea is Cristal blue and you can see right through it. Water temperature in may was great. The beaches are really tidy and clean as the hotels do take care of them and pick every waste they see. Thanks for that!The only ""negative"" thing is that you have quite intesnrive low and high tide so that the water is really low some time. As this is naturally you can't see this as a negative point. "
Nirav,"Mumbai, India",May 2019,A good beach for water activities organised by professional like scuba .. snorkeling...etc Not good for swimming
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,After being shocked at the pollution at Kuta beach we were happy to see that Nusa Dua beach was clean and in good shape. It is a wide and long beach to stroll along. The water is quite clean and refreshing to jump into. There are many hotels along the beach and also here and there some local restaurants. Nusa Dua is definitely a great area to stay in Bali and with a beach in this condition definitely better than many other parts of the island.
TLZZE,"Oakville, Canada",Apr 2019,Cleaner and nicer sand. The riptide in some areas is pretty strong so be careful with little ones or not strong swimmers.
DanaKrick,"Cape Town, South Africa",Apr 2019,Beautiful clean beach. Woke up at 5am to make it to Water Blow by sunrise... absolutely worth the early rise. 
Rumyana L,"Sofia, Bulgaria",May 2019,"The beach is very clean and well maintained. There are areas where smoking is prohibited. The sun loungers are comfortable and extremely well maintained. They are located in enough space each other and there is no sense of overcrowding. An interesting attraction is a wooden swing and a hammock, located in the ocean itself in an accessible location. At the tide of the ocean it is very interesting."
Ange Singleton,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Dec 2018,Amazing place to have dinner as a couple and also great to spend time with the kids during the day. soft clean white sand. 
AkhlassJr,"Edison, NJ",Apr 2019,"Fantastic beach. Compare to Kuta beach its just amazing how clean is it. Water is safe, no big waves or dangerous currents here. We totally satisfied."
Dina A,2 contributions,Feb 2019,"This place was amazing one, we'ere very happy and interested in everything we did.Really it was a beautiful place"
Suzie O,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,Most of Nusa Dua beaches are beautiful with white sand and clear water. Some of the hotels have 'beach cleaners' but others need to ensure they get rid of rubbish on the beach every day.
Loreta S,3 contributions,May 2019,"Beach is in very nice private location, accessible  for all tourists. Very clear water, not crowdy. Families with little children would enjoy this beach as well. Overall nice place to spend your day out in a sun."
Carol B,6 contributions,May 2019,"we went there pretty much everyday during our stay. the beach was mostly privately owned by the hotel. depending on which hotel you stay at, you will see different part of the beach. Overall, very relaxing place to spend the day."
Antony B,16 contributions,May 2019,Safe and quiet beach that allows you to discover many rock pools during low tide and walk up to the surf break
Narelle Z,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"Nusa Dua beach was very clean and so pretty. Beautiful clear water. You can walk for kilometres along the beach, so lovely."
Michael D,"Camden, Australia",May 2019,One of the nicest beaches in Bali . Beautiful white sand and clean clear water . I would recommend any beach lovers to come to this beach
RanjaniManthri,"Bangalore District, India",Apr 2019,"It was low tide period and the beach was good 4 kms away from actual beach, didnt enjoy much, It was quiet unclean as well       "
Adelene Tschuma,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,"Beach could do with a little bit of cleaning up. Rubbish all along the edge of the water and in the surrounding gardens. Sand near the resort is immaculate, but if you venture any further the condition starts to deteriorate. Placing a few rubbish bins with clear signage may help a little. Sand is a beautiful white colour and water isn’t too bad as the reef seems to clean it up a bit. Lots of water sports and activities to choose from as well. Not bad for Bali! "
Vic And Barb,"Phillipsburg, NJ",Feb 2019,Really nice beaches . Much cleaner than the beaches we normally stay at in Seminyak.  Really nice part of Bali.
Michael B,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2019,Visited the Bali Collection in Nusa Dua and paid a visit to the beach whilst there.  Beach has a nice walking path but not really the cleanest one I’ve ever been too.  Nice variety of food choices along the beach with some nice kid friendly areas.  It was only a quick visit so will have to go back next time I’m there to get a better feel.
PeterOdgaard,"Aarhus, Denmark",Apr 2019,Nice well protected beach with shallow waters even if waves are high at other places at the coast. Beach all long the beach and the hotels at the shore.
Ashley M,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2019,Great place to laze around and have a few relaxing drinks with friends Easy to get to and inexpensive 
Isa B,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2019,"Love it. 360 degrees picture ready Got my phone a new wallpaper instantly Super big waves and great for surfers.Non-surfers like us, we had so much fun jumping the waves alsoSpecial thanks to the grand Hyatt Bali  team, we can see that our part of the beach is actually the cleanest!!Nice memory "
28jeanmarier,"Quinns Rocks, Australia",Apr 2019,"Beautiful stretch of coastline with plenty of beach to laze about. Hotels have kept their respective beach fronts accommodating. Water is very inviting but full of rubbish. We really weren’t keen on swimming with plastic bags, chip packets, food scraps, bottles and reed baskets. I really don’t know why anyone was keen to hire a surfboard despite the nice waves. It was a terrible sight. The Balinese would go a long way to teach people to keep the waterways clean. "
Lars B,"His, Norway",Apr 2019,"Perfect place for a calm vacation! They sweep the beach for garbage every day to keep it cleen. Good restaurants along the beach. Expensive, but worth it. Very good service! "
Susie,Philippines,Mar 2019,Perfect and staffs are very friendly and accommodating ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️the Hotel is very clean and I remember I booked me deluxe room but they put me in premiere room surprisingly and it was very overwhelming experience.I can’t wait to stay back .
Tony V,21 contributions,May 2018,"Great place to unwind.3 Visits and we just keep getting drawn back, Nothing outstanding and not cheap like some people expect but a reliable nice place to visit ."
Jo🐠,"England, UK",Apr 2019,Lovely beach. One of my favourite in Bali. Would definitely come back to this beach lovely sand and lovely water
KerroTravels,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"A nice enough beach with areas marked off for the resorts and other areas open for local families to play. There’s a long reef off shore that creates great waves for surfing. The water is generally clear, with fish and sea snakes (!) swimming about. My one disappointment was the amount of rubbish in the water. Perhaps the hotels could be encouraged to leave garbage bins at the resorts for people to put a piece or two of rubbish in and help clean up the area.  "
Dani,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Apr 2019,The Beach in front of the Mulia is gorgeous. Lovely to lie at or walk along. However at low tide there is rubbish that washes up (normally in the evening) which can be quite gross. The sand is nice but quite rough so can hurt your feet. Not as amazing at Australian beaches but still really nice! 
Ian Manborde,"Coventry, UK",Apr 2019,"A long stretch of sand with plenty to see so. Large stretches are given over to chain hotels and, whilst lawns are manicured, adjacent restaurants are steep. It's a beautiful place to visit (we did jetskis etc) but do your research first on what you are looking for."
BabyH73,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2019,"Our first couple of days here this beach was heavenly. Clean, crystal water and peaceful. However a couple of days in I was shocked and the piles and piles of rubbish on the beach and floating in the water. So disappointing. "
SriyaniT,Lincoln,Apr 2019,"The Nusa Dua Beach, is very popular. Wide sandy beach and warm sea. We were here during the full moon so it was a little rough. Very pleasant, not crowded, but very touristy."
Deena M,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,"Beautiful yellow sand. In front of Meliá resort water calm, safe water. Short walk toother side sea rough."
Deb F,8 contributions,Apr 2019,"The beach is stunning! You can sun bake, swim, do water sports, get hair braids ...all of these are at your disposal"
Sudhir N,11 contributions,Apr 2019,Has potential to be a good beach. However plenty of weeds and rubbish strewn around by the waves. Needs regular cleaning for a better experience.
Eileen C,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,Come during low tide and you can walk a fair distance out to the sea. Great for hunting little crabs and fishes in the little pools left by the tide.
rohitpunjabi1,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,A very long beach where one can actually go for a long relaxing walk. The cleanliness of the beach is also worth a commendation. 
Nick and Angel S,"Milton Keynes, UK",Mar 2019,"The beach at Nusa Dua is an absolute stunner! I’m not a beach person, but this is one of the most beautiful beaches we’ve experienced!"
David Read,46 contributions,Nov 2018,"Fantastic golden sands and deep blue water. Beach sheltered with waves breaking several hundred metres from shore. The real pity was - the water was full of rubbish :( All small plastic bits and pieces of crap, small bags, straws, sauce containers etc Others have told me its a 'seasonal' thing and most times the water is clean and clear ... its filthy in the wet season sadly :("
Christmas2010,"Atlanta, GA",Apr 2019,"The water is clear and warm, but there is a warning sign about sea urchins and jelly fish. It made me stay out of the water."
Varun G,China,Apr 2019,Happy to see blue colour of the Sea. Great to sunrise !... We enjoyed bicycling around the area as all hotels are connected through a walking / cycling path in parallel to beach.
Azee B,8 contributions,Mar 2019,Had some nice leisure time with family at nusa dua beach. The rain made it more interesting. Highly recommended for visit.
0rthopaedics,"Sligo, Ireland",Mar 2019,"had a private part of the beach as part of the hotel, but walked all along, spotless and beautiful sorry we didn't get to see the sunset!"
Neil S,"London, UK",Apr 2019,Fantastic beach great views. Used the free shuttle bus from Novetel. Loads of space nice and clean. Easy walk up to the water blow
RMK_10,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"One of the best beaches in Bali for sure.Hotels around normally keep the beach spotless most of the time by using Staff.So it's pristine golden sands beach. Lot to do swim,surf,fish,boat, paddle whatever you like all available.If you walk either side of the beach you will come across some of the most prestigious Hotels of Bali.Also, many beachside bars, restaurants to sit & watch the world go by. There was even a Cruise ship stationed not far whilst we were holidaying.Most lovely place to enjoy the fresh sea air, take in the sun & enjoy best of Bali."
SumalaiChinklang,"Pattaya, Thailand",May 2018,"Clean beach with deep blue sea, clear sky, you can lay down all day and can exited with surf activity."
Perlaky Mate,"Budapest, Hungary",Apr 2019,"Compared to some other beaches in Bali, the amount of trash in the water and on the shore is bearable. The waves can be pretty good, there are changing rooms and restaurants and the ambiance all in all is fine."
S C Mishra,43 contributions,Dec 2018,The beach is nice with good waves. Onecan take sea-bath and go for swimming.The beach is good for going for walk.The sun-rise and sun-set at the beachis worth-seeing.The arrangements​in the beach are good.
Sue M,"Williamsburg, VA",Mar 2019,"All the five star properties border Nusa Due Beach and each resort provides for their guests, loungers, beds, chairs, etc overlooking the beach.  The area is also patrolled by hotel security.  There is a great walkway, paved well for guests to walk from one resort to another, there is a public area in which folks can rent surf boards, etc.  There is a temple that one can visit from Nusa Dua Beach and of course there is the Water Blow to walk to as well.  Have plenty of water with you as it is quite hot and humid,"
MrsJulia2307,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2019,"Great place to relax after working and business trip, I have to spend over the time until sunset in this beautiful beach "
Companion530104,48 contributions,Mar 2019,"This Beach area is Quiet, easy access, great for children and for elderly. Perfect for all ages and safe. The tide is mild."
sabi0james,"Manila, Philippines",Mar 2019,"From our hotel, the Courtyard free shuttle is provided to visit their beach club in Nusa Dua beach. It seemed that surfers frequent the area. The club provides free use of loungers and umbrellas. One can just lie down and enjoy the beach,with fresh coconut juice or other drinks available for sale."
CKteckey,"Greater London, UK",Mar 2019,"One of the best beach in bali. Clean blue water with much needed privacy. Unlike Seminyak Beach, here at Nusa Dua water is clean with white sand and safe for children as well."
roger a,15 contributions,Mar 2019,"Lounger and umbrella hire very reasonable.Lovely beachSome access areas to the sea are steep, others are fine, and to the far left hand side it is ankle deep for a good 300yds and more. "
Desniar B,"Depok, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"located behind the 5stars hotel, all this beach are very nice and calm, all area well maintain with guard standby from each hotels"
Cheryl B,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,Great holiday and great to see Rosalina again at Westin Resort.  A little disappointed with the quality of afternoon tea
Wayne B,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,"The first things that struck me was how clean Nusa Dua beach was, both the sand and the water, and that it wasn’t anywhere near as crowded as the beaches at Kuta and Seminyak.There are plenty of day beds that you can hire in addition to those of the various resorts.The waves close to the shore are very minor but the depth drops quickly. It is a great place to swim or simply relax.There are good breaks for surfers but they are well off from the shore."
Jeff C,"Sandy, UT",Mar 2019,"Nusa Dua beach checked all the boxes for me.  A large, expansive, white sand beach, the water is shallow close to the beach and pleasant to soak or swim in.  Further out, surfers find waves large enough to thrill them.  The usual water activities are available and it is just a short walk from the Bali Collection.  We had a great day there."
Jakub J,"Warsaw, Poland",Sep 2018,"Great place to visit, soft sandy beach with many different amenities like bars and restaurants. Picturesque place. "
Chris L,162 contributions,Mar 2019,"Took me four trips to Bali before I journeyed here. The beach is amazing. Be prepared to pay a bit of extra money if you eat at one of the restaurants overlooking the beach. A tourist resort spot for sure, not the “real” local Bali at all, but manicured to the point of tropical perfection."
pretzel65,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2018,great place to swim and snorkel and there is lots of sprukers to come and bargain with to book  days   trips and get the best price. also good for a drink and something to eat
Saurabh Srivastava,"Noida, India",Mar 2019,The beach is very neat and clean with arrangement for relaxing and suntanning. Normal shower available for cleaning up. Water is blue and provides great scenic view. Great beach to enjoy leisurely walk.
Jackie T,3 contributions,Mar 2019,This has to be one of the best beaches I have visited. Stayed on Nusa Dua beach for 7 nights. Lovely golden sand. Plenty of shade provided by the trees lining the beach.
Di G,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2019,For us oldies I suggest you visit early or late afternoon as there is no shade and the sand and Sun get very hot. A must see though as it is a beautiful beach.
Travel on my mind all the time!!!,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018,This beach is too good and best in Bali for water sport. We were in group and got good discount for Sea walk activity which was a wonderful experience.
Desislava G,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Jun 2018,The beach is nice. The sand area is wide. But in general Bali should not be considered as beach destination
KrishCal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Dec 2018,Clean beach for walks and for a dip. Not much activity in terms of tourists. Some scuba diving joints nearby which can be used. 
Jo E,"York, UK",Feb 2019,"It is what it is really, just another shopping mall with mostly high end shops which must people can’t afford. There are some place which sell normal tourist nick nacks , gifts and sarongs etc.. which are reasonably priced. There are lots of restaurants dotted around but didn’t try any of them. Got 2 single scoop ice creams from baskin robins and it was nearly £9.00!! A spot to have a wonder round, but nothing  to write home about. "
Robin S,100 contributions,Feb 2019,"Since we stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel, enjoyed the beach so much. Clean and super white sands. Lots of water sport activities available. Good even just to chill and sun tanning."
Pete3rd,"Noosa Heads, Australia",Feb 2019,"Forget Kuta, Seminyak and Canngu. If you are looking for white sandy blue water beaches Nusa Dua is it. "
Bgb091,13 contributions,Feb 2019,"Great for all ages, very clean heaps of seating under umbrellas good water sports available kids loved it everyday"
yipjcs88,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2019,"This was my second visit. Nothing much has changed at the beach, still so beautiful and tranquil. The sand is good and the view is expansive. Not many people at the beach-front but there were many tourists resting on beach-benches in the nearby waterfront hotel."
PamF47,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2018,Nice pathway goes along in front of most of the hotels and it is a very pleasant walk along the ocean front without having to walk on the sand
laurenandrich,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Feb 2019,Beautiful beach. Clean. White sand and clear blue sea. Peaceful. Perfect for watching the sunrise. Great for beach walks. 
Claudine F,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2019,"We have spent two days at the beach, both times spending a little bit of money to hire deck chairs mostly for the shade ($200,000 IDR for two chairs and towels for two hours). The water was clear and even at high tide had a nice long stretch of relatively shallow water to paddle in. Lovely white sand with very few hawkers. "
Christian H,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2019,Beautiful beach close to shopping and ample food and beverage options. Great for a swim and learner surfers but do check the tides to time your visit.
Kaylie G,Brunei Darussalam,Dec 2018,"We went here on a day trip from Sanur it was beautiful. Clean, tidy and plenty of space. This is definitely worth a visit compared to some of the other beaches, one of the beach clubs let us use the loungers and toilet facilities for free which was fab, we did buy snacks and drinks though. It was quiet with a few people so it was nice. Highly recommend this beach and we had a two and a 16 tear old."
RENEDOLANBALI,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"As Bali’s most exclusive resort area, Nusa Dua’s beaches are generally quiet and well-kept. The waters along this south-eastern coastline are calm, thanks to the long-stretching Nusa Dua reef breaking the otherwise big swells that constantly surge in from the open sea. Between the two focal ‘twin island’ landmark is a bay with blue waters, a favourite spot for swimming and snorkelling"
Lynn F,"Woodvale, Australia",Feb 2019,dived into the ocean after a long bike ride and it was crystal clear and just so refreshing. There looked like some good surf around the point as well
Sachin S,12 contributions,Jan 2019,"White sand, blue-green transparent water! The only drawback is leaves and grass which very frequently sticks to your body. Definitely one of the must visit places in Bali."
Nicky_c79,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,Lovely beach.  Gentle swell.  Great for kids or inexperienced swimmers.  Not too many hawkers.  I was at the Mercure beach club (most hotels seem to have an area) Would definitely recommend getting a massage from the ladies   It was amazing.  Thank you Annie (#24) 
baliobessed,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,this beach is very clean and not many hawkers.easy to hire paddle boards and jetski’s or book a glass bottom boat or snorkeling tour.lots of restaurants along the beach front.it’s not too deep and no big waves so perfect for little kids 
Michelle M,"Bophut, Thailand",Feb 2019,This beach is basically where expensive hotels are but it is Not my preferred beach. Nice calm water and not deep. Plenty of overpriced hotel food but also local Warungs that are friendly and good too before you get on the beach.  Beautiful hotels and huge private villas..not in my budget. Much better beach is Pantai Pawada. Still happy I went. 
naughtypippy,"Marrickville, Australia",Oct 2018,been there several times beach so clean atmosphere food shops drinks pools etc very good regular over there highly recommend
Nina H,6 contributions,Feb 2019,Beautiful beach - help us everybody to keep it clean 😀. I picked plastic and other things from the beach and I need all of you to help.
rodden23,"Qingdao, China",Feb 2019,"Nice sand, good water for swimming, and plenty of lounge chairs with umbrellas all along the beach.  There are plenty of bars and restaurants along with many locals hawking their various goods.  It’s a good beach with a fun vibe."
tpadvs1357,1 contribution,Feb 2019,Clean beach to swiming .warm water relaxing area .fresh coconut and white sand good for your family on vacation 
SoloOver50Traveler,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,"Nusa Dua Beach is a long beach strip on which there are many hotels, resorts and beach clubs. There are some parts more suited to swimming than others but walk along the path and you will find plenty of places to swim. Most beach clubs are open to the public if you want to stop for a drink, meal or swim. I also saw a few gelato places too. If you are staying in one of the hotels they will have their own deck chairs on the beach for you to enjoy. "
coco bistro balicollection,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Feb 2019,Nice and clean beach to relax and enjoy drink .clean water to swimming during vacation .recomended this beach 
SBT676,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2019,"I did a day trip around Kuta and visited different places to find a good beach spot. Nusa Dua Beach is such a spot where you can hang out all day long and enjoy the clean beach and the waves which are a must for surfer.I found this place because of my excellent tour guide. His name is Gusti and he can be your private tour guide on Bali too.He is a very friendly Balinese tour guide who can speak different language e.g. balinese, indonese, english, japanese.I can recommend him as a reliable tour guide. He has a nice and clean van (with up to 8 seats) for travelling on Bali.You can contact him via WhatsApp (+62 818 053 620 38) and he will follow up with you.In case you would like to contact him via mail please use ngurahsuwitra1@gmail.comEven before you will arrive Bali International Airport you can contact him and he will waiting for you after you exit the airport."
TheMoni17,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,A good beach with pristine clear blue water but crowded with companies dealing in water sports creating a great mess at most of the stretch. So if you are staying in nusa dua try and stay at a property with it’s own beach. 
darrens793,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,"Its just a beach, but it is free and you dont have to climb down steps to get to it. Its clean free from rubbish, rocks and seaweed"
Amanda R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018,Fabulous beach which is the big highlight of the area! I find the area built up and unappealing overall. 
Taxi for Take off,36 contributions,Apr 2018,Plenty to see along the beach but not the cleanest. With many rocks it is not really the best swimmers beach. Water however was very clear. Some very interesting bars and small markets to see.
Conor O,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Feb 2019,"Clean and clear water, no surf, good facilities. Family of grownups loved it. Water slopes very sharply so would watch younger kids."
svvoii,"Changsha, China",Jan 2019,"Looking for ideal beach for swimming and sunbathing? Nusa Dua is the one. Perfect sand, water not deep and not really shallow. Lots of luxury resorts are located in this beach, cafes and restaurants are in abundance but rather expensive compared to other areas of Bali. There is a great shopping mall near the beach ‘Bali Collection’ with carefully selected items from mid-priced to expensive. The cost of deck-chair and umbrella on the beach starts from 100K. The area near the beach is very well groomed and great for photos."
clsuero,"Shanghai Region, China",Jan 2019,"This beach is very clean, easy to roam about and has friendly security and staff. Most of the hotels have an area section reserved for hotel clients, but if you walk down there is a public area and it’s just as wonderful!It is absolutely beautiful and relaxing! Very travel, family and kid friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
Daniel L,"Laguna Niguel, CA",Jan 2019,"Quiet and peaceful beach with a great view.  There are plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas along the sand for parents to lounge while the kids play in the water. While lying there, you can see jet skis, banana boats and other water activities race on the open waters and still enjoy a nice drink.  The kids had a blast in the water because the waves were minimal and the water was warm."
trvl1661,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2019,clean beach arounf with white sand nice place to relax and vacation from around the world recomended nusa dua 
Oh Sydney,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jan 2019,"Nusa Dua Beach is the answer. We stay at Bali Club Med & walk to the beach everyday. You can walk entire beach front from Club Med, to walk pass Sofitel, Westin & other hotels & no one come up to you to ask you to buy something. The views along the beach front is relaxing, hence we power-walk with Club Med’s team member 8:30am in the morning."
EduardPud,Melbourne,Jan 2019,"January - low season but to rainsWater temp 27-29 degrees Celsius Air temp 25-30 degrees CelsiusGreat amenities Beach in front of Ayodya Resort was cleaned regularly, soft waves, great amenities at the Beach Club"
jtwoodfield,"London, UK",Jan 2019,"Gorgeous breach with great views. Reef outside and what appears to be great surfing for those into that. Lots of places for a drink, nibble, or meal. Very well maintained. Plenty of security."
RELAXED000,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,Great beach for a family with kids. Lots of shade under beautiful trees if it gets to hot. The Westin (where we stayed) had awesome service for food and drinks! Can’t wait to go back! Also water sports available 
Yasa12,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"Water spora and dive center (parasailing )banana boat)jrt ski)Fly fish ,tubing .scuba diving)SEA walker"
118janniev,"Centurion, South Africa",Jan 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is the finest stretch of beach in Bali. It is clean, it is safe have so much to offer.Lot’s of white clean sand with a tarred walkway of many miles. Ample Restaurants along the beach  and so many places just to relax and enjoy.No vendor’s in your face all day long like the rest of the beaches in Bali.A great place for a holiday with so many good hotels on the fine stretch of white sand and blue waters.."
gazeer,"Huddersfield, UK",Dec 2018,we moved from KUta .which was Awful..to NUSA DUA beach.which was stunning..clean ..turqoiuse blue sea..fabulous hotels all along....lots of sunbeds....loved it.
ptk_from_dy,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,"The beaches of Nusa Dua are cared for by the resort staff which makes them cleaner than the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak side of Bali.  This comes at a price which is you have to pay for daybeds and the bars and restaurants cost more.  It depends on what your after - as Nusa Dua beach is definitely more relaxing, quiet and there are a number of cafes and restaurants that have good food at reasonable prices."
Larkan1234,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,Nusa Dua beach is very clean with white sandy beaches excellent for families and water sports. Very safe swimming beach
Bal L,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"Nice beach for family and kids, Calm waters, perfect for sunrise, lot of activities to do with the kids and family"
shonajoy71,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"This was our second time in Nusa Dua and we love it. It's so peaceful, friendly, lovely people, the beach has gorgeous sand and with the sound of the ocean, it's so relaxing! Can't wait for our next trip! "
Christopher Y,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2019,"Whilst I love Nusa Dua, upon my 2nd visit i had three close up encounters with creatures i was unaware existed there. The first was a blue ring octopus in the shallows not far from the blow hole. The 2nd two was at the same time in shallow water behind sofitel i saw a large long horned cow fish then turned around to sea a 60cm coral snake coming out of the grass into the peoples swim area to eat a dead crab. I had to stop young kids from playing with it. I think there should be som signs and education going on there as so many families let kids go off to explore. "
Susan E,"Lena, IL",Jan 2019,"We drove to Nusa Dua from our hotel so we could see the beaches. This is a more commercialized beach, with panhandlers wanting you to open up cards to see if you won a prize from a resort. That was annoying. The tide was out and the beach wasn't so that you could put your feet in. We found a peninsula that we could walk out to the end and see the waves crashing against the rocks. That made the trip worth it."
Yuli ca,5 contributions,Jan 2019,Recommended beach to visit in bali. Nice for family. Here i safe for swim. Clean water and beach as well
RajeevRider8833,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,"Excellent location, neat  and clean and clear white sand with blue water beach. Good for family and kids. "
Mirta,St Martin / St Maarten,Nov 2018,"The beach has shallow clear water.  Nice area with boardwalk, many resorts and restaurants on the beach. We spent the day in the area since we were staying in Kuta Beach. We were able to rent chairs and umbrellas in Nusa Dua cheaper than in Kuta. "
camiam001,"Grunthal, Canada",Jan 2019,Been to lots of beaches. This one is near the top of the list. Can get deep fast. Water merky so snorkling not great. Good chair and umbrellas for 50000rpa.
Douglas G,"Isle of Portland, UK",Jan 2019,"I entered the beach area from a pedestrian walkway from the scooter park at the Bay Bali.    When assessing the Nusa Dua beach I am Referring to the public beach at the entry points where most people seem to stay in this area (and are supposed to stay?).  I am rating the public beach sections. To your left as you come out is the more northerly section to the left, strictly speaking this is Nusa Dua beach.  It is a sand and rock beach bounded by massive, and I mean massive, walls of sandbags to protect the coast.  There is another section to your right that is more attractive and the start of the longer southerly section, which has other named beach sections.  At this end it’s ok but the ubiquitous plastic seems to gravitate to this end, so walk further south.  If you look at some maps the whole beach for the next 4km is labelled Nusa Dua beach, however a succession of hotels adopt each section of beach. So although you are not discouraged or checked you get the feeling most locals don’t penetrate to the far end of the beach which took about a 45 minutes stroll. At the end there is a long curving jetty looking up to the Monastery which is not accessible from the beach.  It gets cleaner and here are less people the further you walk up the beach. Overall a nice beach but I wouldn’t travel from Seminak again to go there, although I would say that it looks cleaner water. I also think it’s much cleaner than the beaches going up further north on the Nusa Dua peninsula which gets nearer and nearer to the port traffic and all the pollutants that go with ports.  "
christophter c,"Andover, UK",Jan 2019,This beach is a lovely clean beach staff are always there cleaning. Sea is lovely and warm but can be very shallow. 
JoAnn H,"Naperville, Illinois",Jan 2019,The beach is the reason for the Nusra Dua resorts. Access from the resorts to the safe clean beach area is the delight of beach walkers a d sun worshipers. The well lighted at night paved path to the Bali Collection shopping and restaurant area makes for delightful off sand walking. The beach selling vendors are reasonable in number and not aggressive. This is a paradise!
Dyleen26,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"The beach was not too bad, however, if you have been to other places with better beaches e.g. Redang / Maldives, this beach would not excite you too much. The view on a sunny view was pretty spectacular though."
Kevinanthea,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,This is a gorgeous place to relax and enjoy the sparkling warm ocean. It is safe to swim and everything is gorgeous.
kwtraveler,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jan 2019,"Bali isn’t an island like Boracay where you can find white sand with baby blue beaches everywhere. Nusa Dua was clean, well equipped and you can read a book quietly without anyone disturbing. If you plan to enjoy a day getting tanned and read a book, come to visit Nusa Dua instead of Kuta beach!"
spensterr,"Fort Collins, CO",Dec 2018,Beautiful beach that is absolutely spotless compared to some other beaches in Bali. Not cluttered with vendors or people trying to sell you stuff. Nice waves on the north end if your into surfing. 
Surfingfamilyadventures,Michigan,Jan 2019,We love this beach.  The water is so clear and clean.  It’s warm and has different waves for all levels.  Plenty of room for kids to play on beach and many options for food and relaxation up and down the beach.  Best beach for a family in Bali we have found. 
drolands245,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",Jan 2019,Lovely clean beach warm water .if you are not in one of the hotels you cant use the facilities .thats the only downside but we had a lovely day there
Munster2017,"Hamburg, Germany",Jan 2019,"Nice, big beach that offers surfers and swimmers a good time likewise.We were there as a family. The water is clean and the beach is life guarded. There are some busier parts but also some quieter areas. Watersports are offered. You can rent surfboards for 200 TRup. Lots of surfers there, but close to the beach the water is calm, the surf is further out only. A lot of Aussies, Chinese, other Asians and Russians, but also Eurpeans. Good mix.Lots of big hotel resorts, but still a lot of space for everyone. Some hotels regularly clean the beach. All in all a great place to hang out on"
Tshepiso S,"Centurion, South Africa",Jan 2019,"Great beach, not as crowded kuta/seminayak beach. And plenty of water sports providers for activities to do"
Margaret.Robinson,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2018,"We caught a taxi from Jimbaran to Nusadua for only 100k ruphias and we spent the whole day in a beautiful and clean beach.We ate lical food at a local small restaurant and it was very good and cheap! ""Nasigore"" or fried rice is a must if you come to Bali as it's the traditional dish"
DirtyDewang,245 contributions,Dec 2018,"We caught a taxi from Seminyak for 150,000 IDR ($15 AUD). We wanted to see a nice beach with shops close by. This place still had lots of tourist and a huge one level shopping area called Bali collections. This place is beautiful and clean but the beautiful beachside is occupied by private resorts and their extravagant sun lounges. We were not sure if all resorts allowed outsiders to use their facility at a price but we did manage to find one that allowed us to use their facilities with the condition we had to spend $40 AUD on their food and drinks. I think it was worth it! We lazed around with music and a sun bed, chilled out. This beach is not a good place to see the sunset, however, If I do visit Bali again I will come here again, I enjoyed it."
Hanni,"Atizapan de Zaragoza, Mexico",Dec 2018,"We were here on a cloudy day. Water was fine, though not with the vibrant colors we were expecting.Lots of surfers were on the gentle waves. Water was clean and the sand nice. Our hotel had recicling chairs with their umbrellas to sit confortably and hang your towel.Not exactly the image that we dreamed of Bali, but none the less a very nice place to spend a few hours."
aditya88,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2018,"best place for water sports in bali if you are particular about the cleanliness of the water, which is clear blue! most of the beach is lined up with private resorts which have convenient access to the beach.. several cheap beach shacks and delicious food joints acrross the beach front.. a must visit beach"
Talha L,5 contributions,Dec 2018,"Calm, peaceful and NOT overcrowded. Nusa Dua beach for a refreshing break from the rat race. Great getaway!!"
Wahida S,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,The first time we went ... the tide was low ... the beach was covered with seaweed ... we were disappointed. The next time ... we made sure to come during high tide .... we were still disappointed.  Where's the beach that we saw in the pictures? Is it because it's December? Not sure of the reason.We ended up spending more time by the pool instead of the beach ... 
Hana Š,57 contributions,Dec 2018,"Hi, I have visited already lot of places, so far, this is one of the most beautiful beach I have seen. Recommended also for surfers, as big waves there almost all the time. Water is pure and clean, beach is regularly cleaned. You can rent a place under the umbrella, or have a coffee/lunch in many restaurants. "
Andre E,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Nusa Dua has attractive beaches. Some of which have been sectioned off by various hotels to service their guests. The beaches generally are not as crowded as Kuta and don't have anywhere near the amount of vendors offering their wares as Kuta,  Legian or Seminyak."
Ashwin D,"Johannesburg South, South Africa",Dec 2018,Very beautiful views. The beach is very clean and the water is warm. Some of the best beaches that are around compared to the rest of the world. Very scenic and stunning 
KonradVP,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,This place is a “tourist slum”!There are the paradise-like resorts of course but set one step out of it and paradise changes into a hell. The type of tourists are the young budget traveller and the “too-fat-to DIY tourists”. 
luvvmassiee,84 contributions,Dec 2018,"One of the most beautiful beach in Bali and with crystal clear waters too! You can swim nicely there, but the sand may be a little “drowning” effect for kids. Once you step into the water your legs goes in up to half your knee or more. But nice to just chill and swim, clean waters. "
Chan C,"London, UK",Dec 2018,"About an hour drive away depend on traffic. Nusa Dua is a big resort complex with many hotels, restaurants, shops, an amphitheatre, a conference centre, etc. Its open to all visitors. There are security check on the main entrance. The beach around the bays are white soft sand with calm sea and clear water. At one end of the beach, there is a new observation platform to have a good view of the bay. Also, you can watch the wave crushing the rocks and creating water sprout from this platform."
Hanna K,"Gimo, Sweden",Dec 2018,"Grest Beach, nice restaurants and close to Bali Collection. Very well cleaned and nice surroundings.But check out the low and high tide, What time it appears. "
Foodieandco,66 contributions,Dec 2018,The beach here at Nusa Dua is so serene and quite private.  You can walk for miles avoiding the crowds. A real gem amidst the hustle bustle in Bali!
Matt T,"Keilor Downs, Australia",Dec 2018,"I like Nusa Dua beach because it is not as congested as Legion or Kuta beach. You get people selling stuff, but respectful when told no politely. "
Paul N,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,"The Beach is beautiful, every morning it is groomed and looks pristine.  Great learners break at the north end.  The only disappointing thing is that by late afternoon the shoreline is littered with washed up plastic."
Ali Asgar B,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2018,this is the best place in Bali to enjoy Water Sports activities like Jet Ski and Parasailing and lots more. the beach has crystal Clear waters which is the most beautiful thing
Emile Newton,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jul 2018,"It’s a beachfront lined with hotels which is probably the reason it remains clean and well maintained , I found it rather windy and not ideal for surfing or body boarding, great for tackling some snorkeling."
Roywidjaja,51 contributions,Nov 2018,"Nusa Dua is Bali and Bali is Nusa Dua. Classy, Comfortable, Safe, location.Must visit for first timers. Family, couples, honeymooners, all will savor Nusa Dua and come back."
Diana R,"Aspen, CO",Dec 2018,"It’s not often to find the perfect horseshoe beach with inviting warm blue waters to swim in well this is it .The beach is outlined by hand end resort properties. Stayed at the Laguna Resort  & Spa , loved it!"
Andra S,"Bucharest, Romania",Dec 2018,"awesome, clear water, quite area, clean beaches - in the private area ( we stayed at  the grand private beach ) - grate bar options for food and drinks."
Marcin P:-),"Gran Canaria, Spain",Dec 2018,"Unfortunately the see polluted with plastic rubbish especially visible during waving. Even very comfortable furnitures in the beach clubs and very friendly restaurants, bar to not compensate the very bad feeling of dirty water.During the time I spend on the sun deck on the beach I saw only a few very brave people that was swimming in the water.I saw a 2 man employed to clean the beach from the rubbish, but they were not able to clean the dirty see water! The Nusa Dua authorities: kindly advise you to manage this effectively and in systemic manner ASAP!"
mo_aiguille,"Caddington, UK",Dec 2018,I loved the fact that we had the beach to own own. We stayed at Courtyard by Marriott and they had their own private beach.There are sun beds to relax and towels. Weather was perfect. Best time to go there is around the morning time until around 1-2pm. After that you get low tides and it’s not that great.I really enjoyed my time swimming about and enjoyed the swimming.You do get people trying to sell you stuff or ask if you are interested in water sports. It can get annoying at some point when you are trying to relax but I guess they need to make their money as well.
Liz M,"Hallett Cove, Australia",Nov 2018,"Loved the beach here, not too many hawkers to hassle you, water sports available on the beach and a good assortment of restaurants. "
Julie (Brisbane),"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2018,Unfortunately Nusa Dua beach has lots of plastic and rubbish in the water and on the sand. We decided not to swim at all in the water here.
Brenda C,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,"Nice beach, kept clean by the large resorts.  Not too many hawkers and are not persistent.  A foot path the water blow and beyond, great for jogging or just a stroll.  Plenty of good hotels."
GauravJulka,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,Nusa Dua beach has always been a peaceful experience for us. It’s great for stand up paddle. It’s better to go to your Hotel’s beach resort on the beach so you don’t get people selling you things.

CBM1969,"Alicante, Spain",Nov 2018,"It may not be the best beach we have been to in the world. However it is quiet, calm and clean and so much better than Jimbaran beach. "
Rajai_NJ,"Newark, NJ",Nov 2018,"Lovely walk for a romantic beach walk, the tide creates some very shallow areas that with the right angle of sunset can make very beautiful sunset photos"
ghorbelma,"Bussy St Georges, France",Feb 2018,"It is not the best beach we experienced in our life, but if you llok to quiet and calm and relatively clean beach, you have to  opt to this one (comparing to jimbaran, kuta or seminyak beaches)"
arcsabre,"Nice, France",Nov 2018,"not only tourists get disturbed by this but locals too, but just cleaning every day does not help. i mean how long do they get this it does not work like this. anyway we enjoyed a stroll before dinner at Ginger House Italian Restaurant.thanks Ramon"
Paul B,"Lincoln, UK",Nov 2018,Beautiful beach. So sad about all the plastic on it and in the sea. Beach cleaners were just burying itSo sad.
not-a-big-city-girl,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"A calm beach, not great for snorkeling but quite nice if you want to enjoy the sand and lay in the sun. The swimming is nice and the beach has a gradual decline into the ocean. We enjoyed a small picnic in the water. You could look at taking a picnic table. That could be fun for you too"
Mikesgirls5,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2018,This beach in Nusa Dua is georgous and would say it’s one of the best ones I have seen. We are in Seminyak right now and there is no comparison. It’s quite and very clean they are always cleaning the beach 🏖. Highly recommend
Barkat A,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2018,The beaches on this stretch of Bali are beautiful and clean. Most of them are private attached to the hotels. The tide can  go out a lot and when in it can be perfect surfing conditions.
tina d,18 contributions,Nov 2018,Visited Nusa dua beach in November this year. It was a piece of paradise. Beautiful Sandy beach vt not too much of crowd very nice place hv a day out.
David A,"Wellington, New Zealand",Nov 2018,Litter in water happier with pool at hotel.private beach club was nice but let down by litter in water which is all up the beach I understand this is probably as good as it gets unless you venture out to more remote places.
Bee,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2018,"Gorgeous beach, located away from the hussle and bussle of the city, it’s perfect for couples and families to lounge on. We stayed with our family of 3 and had a great time "
azrin73,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Nov 2018,"Water bit dirty wth lots of leaves and rubbish but the water is clear though, authorities do their part trying to clean the beach daily. The price u hv to pay when staying in nusa dua everything is more expensive than the rest of bali🤣🤣"
GlendaWin,"Greater Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,This is a truly beautiful beach. We have stayed at the other busy end of Nusa Dua and not ventured into the water as there are too many water activities many the beach extremely busy and not safe to enter. The luxury end of Nusa Dua is quiet and stunning and so inviting. No comparison. 
MarkK,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2018,Easy access from all resorts the beach is quiet and great for kids. There are heaps of activity / water sport options on the beach and a variety of reasonably priced food options. All the resorts have sheltered seating on the beach and toilet facilities which aren’t policed so you can set up company where.
Bagsy30,"Rome, Italy",Nov 2018,My fiancé and I spent 3 days at a resort on the beach! Water was lovely and hotels made big effort in cleaning beaches every day 👌🏻 beautiful views 
Dileep Kumar,594 contributions,Apr 2018,Nusa dua is a very beautiful beach located in the southern part of Bali. It is center to many five star hotels and resorts facing pristine beach front. The complex is very well planned and well maintained. Most of the facilities are available close to the beach.
Sweeta S,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Nov 2018,"It ‘s good beach for who like quiet and private but there are some seller who will be there to break your peace ,but still less than other beach ..that what people said ..for me I like Mengiat beach more because there are waves and sounds of beach more than Nusa Dua beach .."
flavell,England,Oct 2018,The beach is good for sun bathing but not great for a dip. “Quicksand” means you sink halfway up your shin before you enter the water where there are sea urchins sea snakes jellyfish and sea weed to keep you on your toes. Water shoes a must but if I was you swim in the pool.
GleanneF,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Nov 2018,Awesome clean beach. Is the best best compared to others in Bali.  Always stay in this area because of this beach. 
30andreas30,"Frankfurt, Germany",Nov 2018,"Nice area with nice and international recognized hotels, clubs and beaches, just do the beach walk and visit the clubs, not too much people here in Nov"
Mobile34655534751,6 contributions,Nov 2018,Such a relaxing beautiful place.. nothing to think about apart from what bikini you will be wearing.
Hassan Alqassab,"Safwa, Saudi Arabia",Nov 2018,I love Nusa Dua beach because it’s pretty quiet and relaxing place not so crowded and it have everything you need Really nice beach and yummy food and great activities I really recommend it for families and couples for honeymoon 
WhyNotTravelInStyle,"Manchester, UK",Nov 2018,"The beach looks beautiful from distance, but on the closer look it is not very clean. Also, the water is not that clean either. I found this to be a bit disappointing. "
navk922,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2018,"We had our resort right on the nusa dua beach. It is a beautiful beach with many resorts on it...nice place to relax and you can enjoy all kinds of water sports except sea walking, scuba diving and snorkeling...for these activities you need to go to nearby islands Nusa penida and Nusa lembongan..."
mr_alok,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"The beach is huge. As it is on the eastern part of the island, enjoy the sunrise while just strolling on the beach. A great experience! "
sandrac257,"Llangybi, UK",Oct 2018,"The beach is lovely,  water nice when the tide is in. You can walk along the whole stretch of His a Dua and see all the other hotels, "
Tanya N,5 contributions,Oct 2018,"The Recreation staff and facilities are excellent  We cycled, did the daily 11am aqua aerobics, archery and badminton. All the staff including Leo, Dwipa and Abas were fabulous! "
tootrue,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"This beach has it all from sandy shores, through to reef and rocks to walk on. The beach was so much cleaner than I expected. Great place to watch the world pass you by."
Niki H,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2018,"Stayed at the Westin. Nice cocoon sun beds. Plenty of shade from the trees when it gets too hot. Kept very clean by the row if resort hotels along the sea front. Good walking path mainly in the shade. A lagoon beach. Great for a swim when the tide is high. Beautiful light late afternoon and a great spot to sit and have a drink / lunch/ dinner and watch the egrets and cormorants fishing for their dinner. Can do paddle boarding or kayaking. Despite all that is available it was a pretty quiet and relaxing beach. The jewellery and sarong sellers going up and down the beach can be quite persistent the first couple of days, but once you keep saying no they stop asking. Would definitely recommend this beach"
Bobos_spm123,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2018,The beach is very peaceful and pristine white. The water is also lovely. Nice beach to relax chill out.
longstorybuthumourme,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2018,Yes coming from the Gold Coast (Aust) I perhaps have high expectations but this beach is ok by Bali (non surf) beach standards but not really worth the effort if you are used to quality beaches
Rene P,3 contributions,Oct 2018,"The personal reviews depend on where you come from and where you live there: units, houses and country I come from beautiful Nowra nsw Australia 20 Mts from beautiful beaches with real white sands I accidentally came to Bali in 2017 and with regrets I joined a Resort Bali membership so here I am again 2018 in Nusa Dua for a couple of weeks""free accommodation"" it happens after coming back from five weeks in Acapulco and Cancun Mexico no comparison what so ever with little boring Bali that everything have to be imported from Australia and Thailand food and craft I had been seven times in BBK and Phuket Island I am not the tourist that come out to the hotel stay in swimming pool all day have some drinks and then catch the airplane go back to there country I do not like how hotel and restaurants treat tourists when they re sell imported food apply services and taxes etc. Retreats "
436dimitrag,"Athens, Greece",Oct 2018,Nothing interesting.i did not like it at all.never again.just sand and sun.ugly place to swim and stay
Nimesh P,11 contributions,Oct 2018,"Beautiful white sand beaches, strong sun, and very clean. The beaches are well maintained by the resorts. Some areas have a sand bar to break the waves making the shoreline calm. There are many vendor s trying to sell trinkets which can be annoying. They don't let up and tend to hover where you are relaxing not to mention they are overpriced when you compare to other parts of Bali like Ubud. Overall a great experience though."
arnabc_iitm,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2018,A good place to spned an evening. The beach has lots of activities which one may explore. The scenic beauty of the beach is very attractive. We enjoyed the evening.
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,Sure this is a expensive area but all the hotels are first class. Great walking path along the beach front gives you direct access to the restuarant and swimming pools. Prices for food about the same as in Australia
Dr. Ayan Das,"Howrah, India",Oct 2018,"It's little drive from the kuta, we going by bike with help of Google map to reach there, once we get into the nusa Dua it's pretty confusing inside as it was surrounded by lots of private hotels and Vilas finally with the help of locals we finally reach to our destination, it's a hot sunny day and clear sky water looks lovely blue and crestal clear with very less amount of crowd. It's so peaceful and sunbeds are cheaper than other parts of Bali. It's a great time we have spent in Nusa Dua. It's must to go Experience for Travelers "
michelle t,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"We walked along the beach front, daily when we were in Bali. Most noticeable was the lack of rubbish, which has become the norm on Kuta beaches. We stayed at Club Med in Nusa and in the area in which we stayed, the large hotels had use of the beaches fronting their resorts, so they were immaculate. Non residents were invited to use the beach and amenities, couches etc, however, were restricted to the beach and could not use the pools etc in the hotel grounds.In some areas, most of which are roped off to prevent you going too far off shore for your safety, reefs were evident, and many people were snorkeling off the beach. The water was calm and clear and great for children.Warning signs are everywhere, telling people that they swim at their own risk as lifeguards are not present and jellyfish are an issue at certain times during the year, although we went snorkeling and did not see any. (We traveled in October). A few local people sell their wares along the beaches, however, they are pleasant and happy just to wish you good morning if you do not want to purchase their goods. Hotel security guards are very visual in this area which makes it very safe for everyone to partake in morning and evening activities or stop into one of the many restaurants, spas or bars which line the beach. Not as cheap as Kuta as most of the establishments are owned by hotels and resorts, but a nice place to relax. "
Nick de M,"Caernarfon, UK",Oct 2018,Each resort has their own part of the beach but it’s not been a problem for us to walk or along the beach. The beach is clean and the water is clear. There are occasional hawkers but generally I’ve not noticed it to be a problem. 
Tobias Wittebrock,"Rhede, Germany",Oct 2018,very very flat water. you di stand up paddleing and all type of snorkeling water sports etc. enjoy a very relaxing time in nusa dua
Tina M,"Maidstone, UK",Sep 2018,"Perfect beach, cleaned daily and kept pristine.  Lots of top hotels on the beach and it feels as though each keep their areas tip top.  Ocean can be a little rough but still lovely and warm"
Cosi_Xs,"Bucharest, Romania",Feb 2018,"The beach is amazing! The sand is nice and warm even when it rains, the water is cold in the mornings and warm in the afternoon."
Bali_Mandiri_Tour,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"This beach it looks like private beach... but not at all because they have road to go to the beach for the public visitors! Very clean, white sands, safe. You can bring your own mat to relax and rest to enjoy the ocean and the beach"
Meg P,105 contributions,Oct 2018,"This is a beautiful beach, with cool lava formations and blue water. There’s no trash and lots of sandy beach. Some parts get less pretty in low tide and watch out of jellyfish. I got stung once- it was shocking but manageable and healed by the next day. "
Andres P,"Washington DC, DC",Oct 2018,"Traveled for business to Nusa Dua. I guess it is my fault since I did not do any homework ahead of time but always assumed that Bali was just like the Seychelles or Mauritius. Nothing of the sort, the beach was not impressive at all, the sand is dark, and barely a soul was bathing in the water. My assumption is that most folks in Nusa Dua stay at the hotel pools but don’t bother go to the beach since it is not pretty at all. Disappointed. "

Herbert Joei B,"Manila, Philippines",Sep 2018,"If you have no access to quality beach in your country then this would be good enough but if you're from the Philippines, Boracay or El Nido will always be better."
loretta22013,"Dublin, Ireland",Sep 2018,Visited here every day and it was just so relaxing. Beautifully maintained and clean. The water was amazing...and the Vista out to sea was really beautiful. As it was attached to the nusa dua beach hotel the barman came by and took orders which was great in the heat
Ray,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"I live here in Canggu zone and when I want to go to the beach I always go to Nusa Dua, the vibe is really good and it is a really quite zone. Cool sea as well. Suggested!"
R & T,South Africa,Jul 2018,"We found these beaches really dirty and unswimmable. There were condoms, needles, and so much garbage on the beaches we were shocked. All outside the major resorts. Quite surprising and disappointed as we expected white sand and blue seas. Like the brochures.  We stayed at the pool. "
stephenmaull,"Guildford, UK",Sep 2018,If you like a walk in lovely golden sand this is the place and kept super clean . Only one thing there is constant beach sellers but ignore them then they don’t pester you 
Michael M,"Ipswich, UK",Sep 2018,"This review is specific to the beach on front of the Nusa Dua beach hotel and spa. It's a very nice, picturesque, sandy beach, with quite a lot of shade available due to the palm trees. You need to get up early if you want sun-beds that are in the shade, as people reserve them with hotel beach towels. In common with many tropical beaches, the water near the beach is a shallow lagoon, formed by the reef which is a bit further out. There is a line of buoys which separate the swimming area from the area used by small boats (some of them fast-moving), so you're not supposed to swim out to the reef. You can have a good swim only around high tide, as it's too shallow at other times. There are some beach-hawkers but they are polite and not persistent and their merchandise seems pretty good."
Lchf66,93 contributions,Sep 2018,We recently stayed at the north end of Nusa Dua and as a runner when ever we are on holiday near the water i love to run There is a great jogging track in front of the 5 star hotels all the way to the Nusa Dua Beach areaAbout 5 km long from where we were stayingIt ends around the south end of Nusa Dua beachMagnificent well kept sandy beach Great spot for a early morming run or walk very quiet to watch the sunrise and do some stretches after a run and breathe in the day before running back to your hotel for a great breakfast 😁🏃‍♂️
Suzie H,"Yamba, Australia",Sep 2018,Best beach in Bali. Had my morning walk and swim in the ocean it was the best start to the day. Very clean as opposed to the west coast of Bali. Just superb. 
Bernardo P,5 contributions,May 2018,"Quiet beach, very close to the hotel and with very convenient bar.But it's not that beautiful (or at least it wasn't when we visited) and it's not worthy during the low ride (afternoon for us)."
Ron G,"Gloucester, UK",Sep 2018,"The beach is beautiful, the water warm and clear, good for snorkelling. The beach comers are constantly cleaning, didn’t seem to be millions of fag butts like I’ve seen on so many others. "
Brigitte P,175 contributions,Sep 2018,A great classic beach that is not too crowded and beautifully relaxed. The water Color is exceptional and the crowd laid back. A far cry from Kuta. Thank goodness. 
Sylvia DrSoul Fernandez,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Sep 2018,"I must say, the beach is very nice, and coming from Puerto Rico I was a bit disappointed... We have very nice beaches that offer accommodations for people of all budgets and everyone can come to our beaches. I think I was expecting more Sea life, very few fish and no coral in this beach. Good for some other water sports but not snorkeling or scuba. The beach chairs and umbrellas were marvelous and very comfortable! I was glad for the umbrella because I don’t use sun block and the sun here is VERY strong!! On my first day got a nice sun burn in only 2.5 hours!! If you just want a tan a some clear beach this is great! If you want marine life... keep looking! "
Intan Savitri,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"Clean beach managed by the ITDC management. we can enjoy the beach without stayed at the hotel, even we have to walk a bit far if we don’t stayed at the hotel. But it’s quite beautiful."
belean,"Uffington, UK",Sep 2018,"The stay at Nusa Dua beach came at the end of a three week trip around South East Asia so was always meant to be a relaxed part of the holiday which it was. The restaurants at the hotel are lovely and there is a reasonable selection of foods. A highlight for us was the breakfast. We would normally head out of the hotel and look for something local. Due to the location of the hotel that would have been impractical so we had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. Although the setting is very similar to other resorts we have stayed in around the world there are a number of touches that make it distinctively Balinese. A down side to the resort is that it is in an area full of gated resorts and nothing around that you can wander out and look at so you feel that you’re tied to the resort unless you want a trip out by taxi . There is a free shuttle to a shopping centre called Bali Collection but it feels like walking round a retail outlet at home. We found it good for buying any toiletries or water that you may need. All in all the resort served a purpose for us. We booked it for relaxation at the end of a trip. The staff were superb and as we found in Bali, the most polite friendliest people I’ve ever met but if you want real Bali you would have to travel out or stay somewhere off the man made track. "
GoiaBella,"Paramus, NJ",Sep 2018,A small beach that you can walk out on to. Vendors come by but will not hassle you.  Being from the east coast USA I found Caribbean & Hawaiian beaches to have more appeal   Not what one dreams of when you come to Bali
Budkus,Israel,Sep 2018,The dullest beach I have ever been to. Simply looks beautiful but not a wave in sight and no depth. Great for photos and nothing more. 
TTownMike,"Vancouver, Canada",Sep 2018,"We spent the first part of our holiday in Ubud. The second half was at the Laguna in Nusa Dua (separate review- awesome place). It was our first time to Bali and we had been warned that the beaches were just ok and that we would spend more time by pools. The beach in front of our hotel couldn’t have been better. Beautiful fine sand. Water temp was 29 degrees but would warm up to mid thirties when the tide would go out. There is a reef maybe 1km our that protects the beach from large waves and large critters. The only downside was at low tide the water would go out and you couldn’t swim. Most of the day the water was high enough though. There are lots of nice hotels (albeit expensive for Bali but 1/4 the price of Hawaii. There are swimming boys marking off swimming area. The bay is about 1km long and is crescent shaped. I am an openWater swimmer so really enjoyed swimming the length of the bay. Do not swim outside the buoys though. I did and was hit by a boat (see photo of boat type) and missed the propeller by inches. Not sure how the boat didn’t see me on a calm sunny day. Ultimately I was swimming outside the buoys so my fault, but come on. Watch where your going Capt’n.Also amazing sunrises!"
ndeyapog,"Windhoek, Namibia",Aug 2018,"On my first morning at Nusa Dua I decide to check out the beach, a mere 200m from our hotel. It was not very full for someone who can be a little anti social like myself. We decided on jet skiing first, it was my first time we went to a little island just close to the sea made up of just sand. we parked, swam a bit and took a couple of shots. Next activity was sea walking. Now this was exciting, I thought they would put an oxygen mask over my head :/...all they do is put a heavy metal vacuum head helmet like thing which is heavy enough to keep you under the water and a little pipe that brings in air into the vacuum (physics came into play). we were down there walking on the sea bed and given bread to feed the fish. you have hundred of little fish nibbling away at your finger tips. its a really great yet a tit bit scary experience. PS: ALWAYS NEGOTIATE YOUR PRICES :)"
Jocelyn Y,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Sep 2018,"Nusa Dua Bali is a more private and peaceful beach, surrounding by the luxury hotel and resort, high security and pricey food around. If you are looking for this kind of environment for holiday, then it suites you, otherwise you may stay at the legian, kuta or seminyak which the location have more restaurants and shop around, reasonable price and nightlife surrounding."

stephen b,"Havant, UK",Aug 2018,"after visiting many places and islands throughout south east asia , bali beaches have to be the worst I have seen , very expensive for sunloungers to rent , the waters around the beach are not clear and inviting as you would get in Malaysia or Thailand and not as warm , local drinks are very expensive to purchase whilst on the beach, if anyone was looking at a romantic trip for a beach setting they would be in for a disappointing trip. our tip is to go to either langkawi island or the southern islands of Thailand where the beaches are better ad much warmer."
xpisa,5 contributions,Sep 2018,"Unlike Kuta which is full of rubbish and strong waves nice beach, not good for surfing, Sand very soft so is hard to walk on. Also once we got there Resort said you have to wear foot ware in water as you will cut your feet, that was never on any sites to warn us that!"
himanshu b,"Pune, India",Sep 2017,This is the best beach in Bali. Very beautiful and clean..it feels amazing to be here . One can spend whole day sitting in the beach and admire the beauty.

RG1980,Mumbai,May 2018,One of the best beaches in Bali. Very well maintained and is raked regularly. Had fun playing with my kids on the beach
sitalbahia,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2018,The low tide in early Sept is from 13:00 to 18:00 which means you have no sea for most of the afternoon
Nicho3169,"Calne, UK",Sep 2018,Got here expecting pristine white sand from all the photos that we have seen. But it is far from the kind of white sand you see in Thailand or anywhere else in the Indian Ocean. It wasn’t that clean and there are hawkers on the beach coming to pester you every two mins. We got lounge chairs for 250000 for two!! Very expensive compared to the likes of Legian. Also the tide was out I would recommend checking the tide times as if it is out there is literally no water

AjitVellore,Vellore,Apr 2018,Very close to the water blow and part of Grand Hyatt. The beach is long and a relaxing walk is a must for anyone visiting the area.
Eduardo,"Dietlikon, Switzerland",Sep 2018,"The beach is OK. The sand is not thin and nice but you can, with some practice build a sand castle. :)The water is clear and clean, which you can be sure because of the amount of algae in the water, which makes it really annoying to swim. There are also a lot of stones half buried in the sand and the water is really shallow (10 meters in, 1m deep). There is the occasion plastic bag swimming but I’d not consider it dirty because of this. There are beach sellers for water sports and massages but they as you once and if you refuse they don’t bother you again. The really annoying part are the jet skis and other water sport boats going up and down the beach the whole day making noise and bringing the smell of gasoline to your nostrils the whole time. "
Jan O,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,Nusa Dua Area is an outstandingly beautiful area of superb  gardens and lawns together with many hotels and The Bali Collection of shops and restaurants.  The beach area is beautiful with interesting walks along the hotel frontages then to the parkland and blow hole.  The sea area  in front of the hotels is subject to amazing tidal ebb and flow. The Pacifica Art Gallery is in the area and well worth a visit.

pjtrainer,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,"We visited the Novotel Nusa Dua beach club on the free Courtesy Bus from the resort and were very disappointed.

lauryte1984,"Kingston-upon-Hull, UK",Aug 2018,"We were amazed how much trash and dirt there was in the water and the beach. It was not inviting and kinda looked dangerous.

Nancy V,"Thessaloniki, Greece",Aug 2018,"When I was planning our holidays in Bali, many users tried to persuade me to avoid Nusa Dua, because it doesn't feel local enough. I am extremely happy I did not listen to them, as Nusa Dua is awesome. The beach is great for swimming in low tide (and for surfing in high tide), the hotels are amazing and affordable, it is not as expensive as they say (for european standards it is very cheap, it is just not as cheap as Kuta or Ubud, but it is a lot nicer), it is not that crowded, you feel really safe walking outside your hotel on your own (in Ubud for example there are so many stray dogs, you feel uncomfortable), traffic is a lot better that elsewhere and you can always hire a driver for exploring (they get the same money they would get if they picked you up from Seminyak and you avoid the horrible traffic jams) and return to a beautiful place for relaxing. People who don't like Nusa Dua are the ones who haven't been there."

But one thing ....I found this beach lil dirty.... it is so crowded in the month of December and January with tourists flocking around from all over the world .

snowges,112 contributions,Aug 2018,Atrocious. Watercraft and plastic debris everywhere. No good for swimming or to laze around on the beach.
Max C,"Phillip Island, Australia",Aug 2018,"This beach is within the tourist precinct and therefore the majority of local vendors are restricted and actually carry a number, if your feel aggrieved. The beach has a large tide of several meters, and can be dangerous to those not familiar with surf at high tide. At half tide, the beach is safe, at low tide the cockle hunters go out to collect food.  Many 5 Star hotels are located on this beach. "
MoniQ,"Mornington, Australia",Aug 2018,Best of the beaches at Nusa Dua but no comparison to Australian beaches. Clean with ability to swim. 
42Chrissy,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Great place to stay except lots of rubbish in the water which is not that pretty. Not sure why the locals do not clean this up.  The colour of the water is amazing.  I would go back here again for a holiday.
Phil B,"Paris, France",Aug 2018,"You genuinely could be at any protected giant beach compound built upon a beautiful natural environment in the world here. If you were parachuted in, there would be zero clue that you are in Bali. This is a sanitised closed shop tourist fortress but its clients recline by or stroll along blue waters which carry tonnes of plastic rubbish beneath. As the waters recede its not a pretty sight. As with other beaches across Bali, the coral is hopelessly unprotected. "
David J,"Finchampstead, UK",Aug 2018,No doubt this is a beautiful expanse if sand with shallow water but also good waves so that you can do some low key surfing.Like many beaches around the world it is plagued by plastic and other rubbish being washed ashore. As there are a lot of hotels along the beach it would be great if they could use their staff to do a daily clean which would then make it a great beach
Sahar J,"Lund, Sweden",Aug 2018,"Disappointed. The beach is okey, alot of hotels and their guests here, but we will not go back. Alot more better beaches along souther part and in ulu watu. So much plastic bags, leftovers and crap along the beach so it was not nice"
Morrison S,"Pretoria, South Africa",Aug 2018,This is where you want to be if you want to relax and enjoy the sun. Generally good weather this time of the year with temperatures in the high twenties.  Jetski or snorkel or layak or whatever watersport you choose.
rickalexwestoby,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018,"Great for strolling, swimming and joying the he clear warm water. Great little cafe at the end of the beach with food and drink. Also contains all the weather sport equipment."
wesheltonj,"San Antonio, TX",Jul 2018,This is the place to enjoy the beach.  Don't waste your time else where.  Everthing you would  want is available here.
Denis R,"London, UK",Aug 2018,"Beach runs as far as the eye can see and the water is so inviting. Just a short stroll over the clean sand and you're swimming in warm, clear water. We went as a family and my 2 grandsons had a ball both on the beach and in the water. Beach is definitely NOT overcrowded and in the time we went there we saw maybe 20 people in both directions. Definitely the beach to go to for a truly relaxing time and to escape the rat race. I'll be going back."
dreamcode,17 contributions,Jul 2018,"Beautiful clean beach starting from Sofitel resort, followed by Nusa Dua beach hotel resort and as far as Melia hotel. further down to St.Regis its is very private and clear and not many people about. That is also the expensive side of the hotels including the grand Hyatt Hotel. Plenty of security through out the beach strip and very approachable guards greeting you all the time. All in all definitely a must go!"

Tassssgirl,"Tasmania, Australia",Jul 2018,There is bits of plastic in the water. Not too many people trying to sell you crap. Safe swimming for little kids.
Jamelov,"Newark-on-Trent, UK",Aug 2018,"This is a five star beach hotel. We enjoyed our stay here, but felt it lacked much of the authenticity that our other hotel in Ubud had. The beach is lovely white sand, although when the sea goes out it is a long way to walk to get deep water. It is easy to access cheap places to eat, street cafes etc- or restaurants in The Bali Collection but there is always a hard sell- especially from the beach hawkers. A lovely beach for photos. "
echo,"Lakes Entrance, Australia",Aug 2018,Beach looks clean but don't dig in the sand you will come accross all the buried rubbish. Was pretty horrible watching them dig holes and sweep all the rubbish in
Paul C,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,"Hard on feet, especially in the surf. Bring rock shoes & plenty of sun screen. Tides are quite big & can be very rough at times."
Wendy G,"Toowoomba, Australia",Oct 2017,"We chose to have a day trip to Nusa Dua and visit turtle island , we enjoyed going to see all the animals on the island. We had a fresh coconut juices while we were there. "
Francisco G,"Matosinhos, Portugal",Aug 2018,"The sand is very soft and yellow.However we did saw sone plastic in the sand... very little but it’s there.Unlucky for us, the sea was in bad mood for all week and no swimming was allowed... "
Roger J,34 contributions,Jul 2018,Very clean and quiet beach..hotel staff clean certain beach areas every day. Many hotels on the beach and very expensive. You can hire beach chairs if hotel not on the beach.
Koen B,"Lommel, Belgium",Aug 2018,This is for me the second time I come here.  The first time in July.  And I’ll never come back.  It’s like blankeberge in Belgium or a stupid place on the coast in sudden England.   It’s full with noisy tourists all making to much garbage in noise but also in the sand.   Nevertheless is this f.e. In October a superbe beach and nice place.
Karen D,81 contributions,Jun 2018,The beach area was lovely infant of The Mulia were I stayed. The sand was a grainy sand and quite soft when you walk in you sink a little. The visibility was amazing and next time I will bring my snorkel gear to explore the reef area a little further out. All in all the beach was lovely and I never saw any sign of rubbish. I was not at an attraction therefore I was unable to answer all questions pertaining to costs. You are able to use that section of the Nusa Due beach if staying at The Mulia Resort.
vactionerAmsterdam,"Sandringham, Australia",Jul 2018,"We stayed along this beach for a week.  We tried to go snorkelling and quickly found out that the sea was teeming with sea lice which made the experience uncomfortable, but worse, the water had a lot of debris in it....lots of plastic bags.....even this slice of paradise is polluted. Pity."
Louis B,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018,"Better than I expected, the locals are the friendliest people I’ve ever meet from any where around the world , the food was exceptional and all food and drinks where great value and affordable"
Joe D,"Taupo, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"A pretty good beach spanning the length of the resorts, quite a bit of rubbish around but if you get there early enough you arrive just after they’ve raked the whole thing and it looks pretty nice. A walk around the the blowhole is well recommended."
Vicky W,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,We visited this beach during our stay at nearby hotel early this year. I was shocked that lots of debris in the water. I know the pollution is a big problem in Bali and I do acknowledge there are workers do their best th clean the beach every morning. It is really a shame for otherwise a beatific place. Coming from Australia I think we take clean beach for granted . 
Chucksaddict,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018,beach was ok. safe to swim from morning until afternoon time. mostly low time around 5pm onwards. although you can still enjoy the view and just relax. 
Eungyeong J,7 contributions,Jul 2018,"Nusa Dua Beach was our main destination, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed when I first got there. 1. Resorts. The big resorts monopolized the beach, it was hard to find a nice little restaurant or affordable sunbeds by the beach. 2. Trash. There were plastic wrappers and seaweed floating around the water here and there. You just have to swim past it.3. Suitable for swimming, not too deep, waves are not too big, white sandy beach. "
Kiamaexplorer,"Kiama, NSW Australia",Jul 2018,Beautiful to look at but ruined by pollution. We attempted to swim as it looked so inviting but kept running into floating rubbish.
Lani S,"Bogor, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"One of clean beach at Bali. With small waves and sof sand, this place situable for children to play."
Paul L,"Denmark, Australia",Jul 2018,Nicer than Kuta/ Legion area. Surf is held back back by a barrier reef. A large lagoon really. Okay for swim and bodysurf if you don't mind pulling plastic bags off yourself. A lot of water activities along this strip too so can be noisy and smell of fumes.
Sandeep57,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jun 2018,"Had the morning run at the NUSA Dua beach , it was really best experience to be part of the run. It energies you "
ketut w,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2018,This is not the first time for me to come to this place with friends. Nusa Dua beach with its white sand beaches and morning sunrise will welcome you in a very warm and peacefull surrounding. 
kymjane86,"Antrim, UK",Jun 2018,"There were a few pre-wedding photo shoots going on and I don’t think you could swim that far out however having said this it was a beautiful beach and the best thing about it was it wasn’t too busy. It was a very relaxed environment quiet and the breeze was lovely as it often felt too hot around the pool. You could eat at the beach restaurants and walk from hotel to hotel:each that join the beach ,but other than these few hotels I think it is private to people staying in these hotels (it’s not a public beach?!) There are sun loungers and there are different styles of beds even four posters but I think these belong to one of the hotels where we weren’t staying so not sure if anyone could use them. Plus I think they were mainly intended for massage. There are sellers on the beach but not many and they’re okay. It is cheap for hair braiding!! We really loved staying here. "
Simon-from-Adelaide,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Nice looking beach with plenty of sun and sun beds for hire but water can be rough and a little dangerous, and is very polluted with plastic and general rubbish. "
Megan M,"Edgecliff, Australia",Jul 2018,Aussies will find this beach and water clean and lovely! There is a blowhole half way down which is good too. 
MrsRebeccaDC,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2018,Lovely clean beach with minimal current compared with the sea on the west side of Bali. Lovely yellow sand and nice views of Mount Agung and Nusa Penida on a clear day 
Alok Nahata,"Alor Setar, Malaysia",Sep 2017,This is the beach which offers you a great atmosphere with natural beauty at its best. Good for swimming...
Naufal J,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Specially for sunrise view, this is the best place to enjoy the nature. Clean and nice place to outdoor activity, but the main gate is small because lot of hotels are stand by side this beach."
Danny S,Jakarta,Jul 2018,"We always enjoy swimming in Nusa Dua beach, the water is relatively calm and the crowds are mostly family type."
Kamara,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018,"Want a beach that’s not crowded and over run by hawkers then the Nusa Dua beach is for you. Take a lovely stroll down the walkway or on the beach itself. There are some nice spots to stop and take some photos especially at sunset.Everyone can enjoy this beach couples, singles or families of any age or size.Check it out as we forget how important it is to get into nature and see this beautiful world of ours."
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2018,"This is a long stretch of beach fronting hotels. Great for morning and evening walks with paved walkways which are also good for cycling. The sea here is good for a dip with moderate surf for beginner surfers. The beach is clean but the sea is not that clean with plastic waste floating in some places. Lots of activities on the beach with hawkers selling innovative looking kites, sea activities and food stalls. Lovely views, sea breeze and lots of sun loungers to relax and tan."
Peter74norman,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2018,"The part of the beach I visited were littered with garbage, but it is different every day but it looked like this for two days. Otherwise a quite crowded upper part where the hotels have taken parts of the beach for them selves. "
Kelz,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2018,It’s a whole stretch with different hotels but you can walk through allIt’s a beach. You have guys there hawking water sport activities like paddle boarding and the like so you can do that. Lots of restaurants too. It’s good. Just not white sands
Tony D,"Hobart, Australia",Jul 2018,Great area being surrounded by a reef it made it relatively calm to swim in the designated areas without worrying about being pounded by waves or carried away by a rip.
Arnd T,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2018,Excellent beach with excellent security and large variety of hotels and restaurants shops and beach side sun beds.
Tripti T,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Jul 2018,It is an quite beach with beautiful horizons. For a long distance less depth in water. Greenish near shore and blue faraway. Lot of people talking bath. There is a beautiful campus on a narrow part of the island. 
Andrei N,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"Having been to many different beaches I would say that Nusa Dua beach is nice and pleasant to stay at. The tides there are pretty dramatic and water can go away virtually completely. The sand is a bit too soft, sinking. Overall, however, it is a good beach with excellent facilities provided by top notch resorts."
Walter Ash,271 contributions,Jul 2018,"I’m reporting on the strip of beach from the Nusa Dua Hotel up to the Melia near the Bali Collection. No waves at all for this stretch but they can be seen some distance out as they hit the reef, so the sea is fairly gentle with a strong ‘current’ right to left as you look at it. There are buoys fairly close to shore and guests are asked to swim within those boundaries and warned of sea urchins at low tide. The sand is constantly raked to dispose of the seaweed as it covers the sea bed up to the reef and beach cleaners are in evidence. There are ‘licenced’ vendors in blue polo shirts all numbered, selling: watches/ water sports/ handbags/ sarongs etc, but well behaved and leave you alone. There is a pathway all the way along with good beachside restaurants owned by the hotels and they are friendly and seem to be good quality. There is a massive building project on the go which is a shame but I dare say when finished it will be great, that is past the Melia and the little ‘island’.Paddle boarding and kayaking is ideal and there is the obligatory jet ski which zoom past but they take the paying guests further down past the Nusa Dua beach hotel to play."
Ajinkya,"Varca, India",Jul 2018,"Well nusa dua is very clean beach with blue water with some good set of restaurants around , however the beauty of this beach is limited only to water sports. Been here to do some water sports activities , found them quite expensive and average. Wanted to take a dip inside the ocean but ocean was full with all sort of activities. Always crowded with group of people trying to enjoy sports activities and gets very loud."
annmW9739DW,"Griffith, Australia",Jul 2018,A beautiful beach always a lovely cool breeze .  This was part of our holiday at Grand Hyatt.   Loved every minute.Not over crowded..lots of banana lounges and no charge.
Vickster,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jun 2018,Only here for the day. Hired a couple of sun loungers and had a nice relaxing afternoon on the beach. The waves were  very dumpy on the day which made swimming difficult. We saw a few people get bowled by the waves and one lady carried out by the lifeguards. The walk along the boardwalk was nice and the beach in front of the huge resorts was very quiet.
Orminge,"Saltsjo-Boo, Sweden",Jun 2018,We loved the beach but beware of big waves and currents. The bech walk is long and really nice to walk on.
MarkwYorkshire,"Bedale, UK",Apr 2018,"We went at the end of April to this beach whilst staying at The Laguna.  The beach is really nice lovely sand nice setting and not too busy.  It is tidal so the tide goes out but then this allows you to explore and see some fantastic things amongst the rocks and cave.  If during low tide you want to swim pop back to the pool.Early in the morning there is some seaweed but this is very quickly cleaned up, but we have really got to remember this is a real Beach!Overall a great beach "
Jacqui’s Journeys 🌏,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Nice and relaxing - beautiful white and sandy and peaceful! Mainly western resorts around.The waves break far out on the reef- nice for a change!
Andy C,"Grantham, England, United Kingdom",Jul 2018,We live in WA so usually when we get a beach holiday elsewhere we can be disappointed. Not this time. The scene is reminiscent of an advert for Bounty chocolate. Lots to do as well. Paradise
NicciBonfanti,"Epsom, UK",Jul 2018,Lots of big hotels and plenty of lovely places to eat and drink here.The tide was low when we were there so more for paddling than swimming.They can organise water sports for you there but this was a more serene place for sunbathing. Saw it set up for a wedding too and looked beautiful.Nice to spend relaxing time there. 
Michelle M,5 contributions,Jul 2018,Spent an arvo on a lounge with drink in hand watching the kites. No one hassled us at all and was just how a beach on holidays should be.
emrezz,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Jul 2018,İt was quite nice beach. The beach was good but the sea not like thay. The sea is very short you cant swim you should walk
patrick n,44 contributions,Jun 2018,Best to swim Eastern side of beach near Hyatt. 2 beaches to chose from - separated by a headland with spectacular blow hole. Well worth a visit. 
Anton M,"Barwon Heads, Australia",Jun 2018,"Great eateries and shopping that offers a wide range of dining options Conveniently located adjacent to many of Nusa Dua major resorts Offers convenient shopping with many other services such as spas and massages, Haircare and supermarkets "
pr0udmum,melbourne,Jul 2018,We loved Nusa Dua beach it was so clean and beautiful not many people selling things which was nice and overall loved it kids could swim with the net being there felt safer 
Jasmina J,"Vancouver, Canada",Jun 2018,"We stayed in Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua for few days. The beach in front the hotel is been cleaned each morning and is very clean. We loved that the lush trees were on the beach instead of umbrellas to give you shade. It just felt so natural and beautiful. You don’t see many people swimming as the tide is low , it comes up to knee level and when the tide is high maybe to waist level. It is the only beach we found in Bali that would be considered children safe. Waterblow was near by, 5 minutes walk and I would recommend an early morning walk to see the sunrise.Most beaches in Bali have bigger waves and are not suitable for swimming. You will see many people just playing in the shallow water or jumping the waves. Most beaches are suitable for surfing. A bit disappointing. "
Dave M,38 contributions,Jul 2018,"Not the best beach but not terrible.Only good when high tide, not a nice beach at low tide.Walked from end to the other to check out other areas.Outside larger resorts was kept reasonably clean otherwise could be littered with rubbish in other spots.Reasonably busy but nothing unexpected given how many resorts back on to it.Some basic water sports options if you are staying at one of the resorts (paddle boards, kayaks etc)First time to Bali, prefer Thailand beaches to these water is also warmer than what we experienced in Bali "
rosihan t,"Batam, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Nice beach in Bali,very clean the beach,so clear the sea water you can see the sand until deep water,nice place for take photo"
Yenfnd,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"Mornings were better due to high tide and less rocks in the sand. Lots of seaweeds on the beach though, so the beach didn’t look too clean. Still a fun place for water activities. Not as crowded as other popular beaches. "
pebbleskip,"Flowery Branch, GA",May 2018,"The beach was clean and had a lot of chairs/lounges to relax in.  It's a destination wedding venue and we saw brides and grooms everyday!  They had set up a flower arbor and it was kind of fun to watch the photography from a distance.  We also watched some locals fishing way out in the water wearing traditional fishing clothing and conical hats. Never saw them catching anything but it added to the scenery!  There is a nice walkway out to the water where you can watch the sunrise.  It is worth getting up one morning (at least) and walking out to photograph!  If you don't make it out of bed in time, I'm posting a photo for you to photoshop yourself into.  It's very lovely!"
Globetrotter08uk,"Cleethorpes, UK",Jul 2018,"This is a nice pale, sandy beach in Bali.  We visited whilst out for a meal.  Lots of boats out in the water and not too many flies or mosquitoes as it was dark. Would recommend. "
griffon_remy,79 contributions,Jul 2018,"Surprisingly nice with the resorts planting a row of beautiful palms and large leaf plants at the top. Tides are huge and can leave the reed exposed during low tide, in some cases the ugly wave break is exposed in front of Sofitel. A public walkway located at the top of the beach and is well built, serving walkers, bikers and as a valid connection in between hotels.There are little bars and freelance masseuses at the ends of the beach in between the big hotels, not as cheap as Kuta but ok.In July dry season the breeze blows consistent off the see and is refreshing and welcome."
ScottinSingapore,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2018,watch out for critters lurking in sand at low tide or wear sandals! great space though sometimes a bit windy
Robert-Jan1972,"Brussels, Belgium",Jun 2018,Before our recent visit to Bali we read a lot about dirty beaches. Well the beaches from Nusa Dua are simply breathtaking and beautiful. We walked along a few hotels and all beaches were clean. No worries and have a great stay. 
Ritesh_wanderer,Delhi,Jun 2018,"One of the few beaches, where you get natural waves big enough for surfing.Need to be careful though as there are no life guards and the waves can be deceptive"
Susanne Q,"Salzburg, Austria",Jun 2018,"The Nusa Dua Beach is a big and clean beach arround the great Hotels in Nusa Dua. Unfortunately, when it rains, the sea flushes garbage to the beach. The garbage in hole is generally a big Problem. The Hotel staffs are effort to clean the beach as it is possible."
draganjulie,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean, quiet and private location. There is a variety of water sports to do. Its a great spot to relax in the sun."
turnzey555,"Research, Australia",Jun 2018,Would advise wearing water shoes as witnessed a lady in pain from having stood on a sea urchin.  The beach was ok but I wouldn't rave about it. 
TravelingLadyMoon,"Victoria, Canada",Jun 2018,"We spent 3 weeks in Bali and more than one week in Nusa Dua. The best part of beach can be found next to Ayodya Hotel. They have public entrance and you can rent towel over there. Beach area is daily maintained included a toilet, shower and beach bar facilities. Yes, it is not California beach but the best what you can found over there. Enjoy!"
Rui G,16 contributions,Jun 2018,"Cloud be awesome. Except for the trash.Good transparency Great temperature Nice sandBut... trash. I had to walk a while to find a nice area and enjoy the amazing sea.In front of my hotel, was difficult"
Jenny Z,"Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong",Jun 2018,"It is a big public beach with a long stretch. Some nice resorts along it but none actually owns any parts of it. The beach is quite dirty, and so is the water, with plastics and disgusting rubbish everywhere. Since the beach is public, no one is accountable for the cleaning of the beach. I won't come back to this one for sure. "
lizzy5California,california,Jun 2018,"The sand was ok. Indonesian is a populous country, so there is a lot of detritus in the sea. They had beach cleaners doing there best, but compared to Hawaii, or the Caribbean, its not that inviting so swim in. OK for sunbathing."
George_mile,20 contributions,Jun 2018,"We are lucky, Today i Went to this place to refresh my mind luckly we got extra placeIt is Nusa Dua Light FestivalIt was amazing for usNusa Dua is very recommended place for holiday."
Kim V,"Mission Viejo, CA",Jun 2018,Playa Del Carman is far more beautiful.  As is the Napoli coast in Kauai.  But the jet skiing and parasailing is ridiculously cheap.  Great place to stay for a brief down time after a long flight to Bali.  But then go to Ubud.  That’s where it’s authentic.   
Worldwatcher,"Toronto, Canada",Jun 2018,"Miles of white sandy beach alongside crystal clear blue water.  Direct access from our hotel, St. Regis, made this wonderful beach easily assessable."
Vicente Antonio P,"Quezon City, Philippines",Jun 2018,It was a bit windy but generally nice. It had plastics around the beach and some seaweeds. There were alot of people in the area. The showers were turned off adter 5 pm... 
962reneee,"Boksburg, South Africa",Jun 2018,"Clean, comfortable and relaxing beach equiped with an recliner and small table for your food. Stall on the beach to order your food with its bar to order drinks and another stall for beach clothing purchases right there on beach."
nutnbolt,featherstone,Jun 2018,"Very clean with lots to do, able to have a good walk along with no issues. Best time for me to go is early in the morning the sun rise is great with no one trying to sell you anything  "
sarf M,"Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2018,This is the most common place for people visiting BALI and looking to go for beach activities and water sports. Not quite far from the airport and offers most of the major activities. It has a Turtle Island visit which we took as we were with kids. Here you can hold sea turtles and get up close with them. It is a very beach so if you are looking to relax and quiet then not the place to be
Freestuns,MelbAustralia,May 2018,Bali beachs arnt the cleanest in the world. The resorts make some effyto clean up 5heir own beaches with teams of men with rakes but there is so much in the water constantly coming in that when you do go for a swim you will end up with some plastic bag or other rubbish on you. My husband collected a bag of rubbish every day we went to the beach. There were many offering bamboo baskets on the beach everyday that are just left there. 
Missy073,Singapore,Jun 2018,Low tide when we were there but overall nice beach. You can check out the dining option at the bay and the beach club
Seaside69022,15 contributions,Jun 2018,We stayed at the Laguna resort and the beach directly outside the hotel was very well kept all day long. Nice sun lounges and a beautiful view. 
vsi0351,"Luzon, Philippines",May 2018,"Went to see the temple. Unfortunately, it is off - limit to the public. However, at the beach you see a fabulous rock formation. The location is very good for relaxing. Also has nice view for sunset. A very calming place."
Girodeitaliano,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018,It’s the beach with white sandy beach and the wave is average not too crazy so we still can swim and play in the hotel. Bot to crowded beach and there are some luxury hotel located in this beach area
Dominique M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2018,"Large swathes of sandy beaches which are largely carved up by the various resorts which to larger or smaller extents have staked a claim for the portion of beach in front of their resort. Access permitted to these beaches is controlled by the resort to various degrees. You are free, however, to stroll along the pathway between the resorts and the beaches should you wish. The beaches themselves are well maintained with a plethora of sun lounges and cabanas on or close to the beaches."
anniethomson394,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Bar far the best beach in Bali. Contained in a gated community, it is unlike any where else in Bali. Very clean and very well kept with manicured gardens."
ami k,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2018,"This was our first trip to Bali.. I had an apprehension that it will be jam-packed with tourists with no place to breath!The Nusa Dua beach turned out to be fantastic! Absolutely clean, family oriented, not at all crowded and very well maintained by all the resorts nearby.Magically serene...."
Taegan B,43 contributions,Jun 2018,"The beach is clean, plenty of beach chairs- watersports. not massive waves. we had a lovely time at the beach during our week long stay"
handinixx,"Prague, Czech Republic",Mar 2018,A calm and nice beach that is cleaned every day and well taken care of which is very important when traveling to Bali because of the plastic nightmare on most beaches :(
EP L,11 contributions,Jun 2018,Both sand and shore are hard to walk/swim as they are very rocky and hurt your feet. I personally liked Seminyak beaches more. 
praveena356,3 contributions,May 2018,"As i have visited many countries along with beaches, in which i loved the most was mauritius but in comparison with it nisa dua beach along to my sofitel resorts in bali at nusa dua are also very neat and clean ...and the shores and silence of sand make our trip more awesome "
Vicky G,"Shrewsbury, UK",Nov 2017,"We walked along the sea front several times in a 12 days there. Absolutely beautiful! The water was lovely, i do recommend people wear shoes of some sort as the sand doea get pretty hot by midday. There is lots to explore and see. Amazing restaurant all along the beach front. Local venders selling locally made items, cheaper than the shops. You may even come across a few activities specialists offering snorkeling, boat hire, wind surfing and so much more. I absolutely loved while i was just sitting waist deep in the water that i could see hundreds of little fish. It was amazing! "
Rui De Sousa,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Maybe one of the best beach in Nusa Dua or in Bali facing Southeast. It's quite long, not very crowded and the sand it's clean thanks to most of the staff from the hotel resorts. Seen some plastic in the water but not as many as in some other places close by. Will come back!!!"
Patrick P,"Woodstock, UK",Jun 2018,Open clean and very cool beach. Beach outside Grand Hyatt is very picturesque. Well worth a visit. A nice change from sitting beside a boring hot swimming pool.
Mary Anne G,"Caloundra, Australia",Sep 2017,The current in May change this beach into a bit of a garbage dump with plastics and garbage washing up from who knows where. The staff at the resorts rake the sands but the water is still a bit iffy.just what happens in May
Food and Travel Gallery,"Greater Noida, India",Feb 2018,I have visited there in Feb 2018. I had stayed in Nusa Dua for 2Nights at Grand Hyatt. I had a direct access to the beach from my resort. The beach was clean and safe to walk around. The sand was little brownish in colour and clean. The view was amazing with low tides. It is far better than Kuta Beach. The place is so clam and excellent for relaxation. The place was having less crowd. Due to less crowd the beach may be boring for some people. Must visit beach.
srivelm19,"Chennai (Madras), India",Mar 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is very good for water sports activities. . U get all kinds of watersports ranging from sea walking, scuba diving, parasailing, jet sking etc. .if u are visiting from other countries book online for packages and go for cheaper prices. . At location they are very costly. . They accept indonesian rupiah as well as US dollars. ."
sandrenal,"Carrum, Australia",Jun 2018,Stunning beach! Beautiful and clean and each resort does a sweep daily to help keep it maintained. We had a great time. 
Dipteshrao,"Nadiad, India",Jun 2018,"One of the best beach in Bali beautiful beach and white sand make it more attractive. I advise to visit this place once, you love it!"
jimsrao7,"Ahmedabad, India",Jun 2018,"been there with my family, it is really good beach having clear blue water and nice view, had a bar around nice to spend 2-3 hours with family..."
LatchezarL,"Sofia, Bulgaria",May 2018,"Nusa Dua is a vast and long beach, so quiet and beautiful, BUT the water in the ocean is full of plastics, papers and rubbish. What a pity, we used the swimming pool only because of the water pollution. Local say that the wastes are coming from the neighboring island Lombock. Whatever is the reason it is an unpleasant fact and significantly will repel the tourists."
Angnmig,"Denmark, Australia",May 2018,The beach in front of the resorts is mostly very nice however rubbish continues to be washed ashore by the ocean. This requires ongoing maintenance and unfortunately most tourists do not assist. If everyone was to pick up a piece of rubbish every time they walk on the beach then the problem would be solved until the government and the resorts take further action on minimizing plastic use and educating the locals and tourists about the proper disposing of waste.
mei2000ca,"Toronto, Canada",May 2018,"You will find it is so enjoyable to be on the fine sandy beach and it is so gentle and smooth that you will almost forget how far you have walked, very pretty."
bigvicSydney,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,There may be parts of this beach where you can swim. But the huge areas near our Ritz-Carlton hotel certainly aren’t suitable. The tide goes out so far that in the mornings the swimming area starts a long way away and in the afternoon it’s too shallow for too far. 
Reuben S,5 contributions,May 2018,Lovely sand and not too many touts. I suppose the price paid for the hotel chains located along nusa Dua goes toward the mintainence of the beach including the litter management. A great beach for young children.
LUX ESCAPES 🌏 📸,"Perth, Australia",May 2018,Great for a walk or evening stroll. You can walk right along the beach and past all the resorts and hotels. Snorkeling and swimming is good around here and surfboard hire and watersports can be arranged on the beach.
Cheryl L,53 contributions,Apr 2018,"Without a lot in the way of foliage, this beach is hot. It is very clean, however with gentle waves but don't expect to walk anywhere to see other properties...we were at a large resort property (Mulia) which owned the beach area for a good distance."
Donna H,"Market Deeping, UK",May 2018,"Beautiful beach, local workers try to keep clean but unfortunately plastic does come in via the sea. Very quiet when we visited, the sellers were respectful and didn’t hassle you. The beach is sand, wide and very long, just gorgeous. Jet skis, etc for hire. Had the most fabulous massage on beach, haggle well! 💕"
Phil Matthews,"Southampton, UK",May 2018,Lovely beach but tide goes out very fast after 1pm. Lots of beach hawkers always trying to sell you tat but always polite when you refuse 
barbaramowbray,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2018,We visited the beach everyday on our 4 day stay.The beach was clean and you were not hassled.Just be careful as currents were very strong.
isletripper,"New York City, NY",May 2018,It was ok but the boats and jet skis kept interrupting where we were lounging. When low tide happens it becomes too shallow and you kinda get stuck with seaweed portions. Overall it was a relaxing beach. 
travelalot28,"Huonville, Australia",May 2018,"The beach looks very nice but is not suitable for swimming ,tides goes way out , nice to walk through"
NafeeTA,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",May 2018,"This beach has probably the best teal water on the island, offering stunning views and also has a cycling road that allows you to take a ride around the place while not only enjoying the breeze but also getting to see the whole scenic place in a short time."
rich b,"Birmingham, UK",May 2018,"Just stunning , beautiful sands clear safe waters and friendly staffFronted by various high grade hotels so immaculately clean "
satya p,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2017,clear blue waters and relatively less crowded beach. Nusa Dua is better than other more touristy beaches of Bali
Gurjit A,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2018,"We have visited once before and this time round we fully enjoyed the beach. Beautiful soft sands, shallow waters, although the waves do crash down further out. It’s amazing to watch! "
khalil R,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,"One of the cleanest beaches in Bali calm , golden sands and crystal water Most of the hotels at nusa dua has their private beaches But still you can access even if you are not hotel guest "
Hammy59,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,Long beach gently shelving into the sea which is much calmer on this east side of the island. Sand is fairly coarse but good for walking on. Catch the sunrise early in the morning or take a long walk about 6pm when it gets cooler. Plenty of eating choices in the string of hotels that go along the length
B6629MFannb,"Perth, Australia",May 2018,"You can enjoy the day under the trees on a sunbed and the breeze off the ocean is very pleasant, waiters will serve on you so no need to move!"
H9794HCmarkp,32 contributions,May 2018,Very clean spectacular beach. Safe for swimming with a gentle shelf and small waves. There are places to eat along the beach although most hotels have their own area with sun beds amongst the trees. 
DAVID H,"Falmouth, UK",May 2018,"Our hotel fronted onto this section of nusa dua beach with lots of other 5 star resorts also fronting this stretch in between the large statue and the pier. Either side is different - one side was dominated by water sports and had quite a few lots of floating rubbish in the sea, the other side (Bali beach) was a lot quieter with a few bars and places to eat - all in all three stretches of beach that differed quite a lot"
O J,"Vancouver, Canada",May 2018,"Nice surprise - beautiful beach that is not crowded, beach was clean as hotels hire staff to clean the beaches.  White sand, clear water and no buskers."
Mandy C,"Vale of Glamorgan, UK",Mar 2018,This beach came directly off our pool area. Its a lovely safe beach - spotlessly clean - and lots of water sports available.
Swede1979,"Malmö, Sweden",Nov 2017,We hired a driver to go to Nusa Dua Beach for a couple of hours. Not a very secluded beach but still nice with white sand and sun chairs and food for a fair cost.
eliwalgra,"Medford, NJ",May 2018,The best thing about the Hilton resort Nusa Dua was the beach!  Absolutely beautiful!  And also the wild monkeys on the property.
Tony L,"Auckland, New Zealand",May 2018,Visited the beach and felt very safe and the walk to the blow holes was out of this worldGreat places to eat and drinkLots of security but very friendly 
Wei Bing L,"Ipoh, Malaysia",May 2018,We stayed at the Club Med Bali resort in Nusa Dua and walked along the beach past a number of resorts and hotels lining the beach to the south of Club Med. We found the beach here to be cleaner and less crowded than Kuta beach.
Bonans,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2018,"Chain of luxury hotels along the beach, but open for public as well,there is an area where you can borrow beach sun lounger and chairs for a minimum fee. But beware if you’re ordering refreshments because as per my experience they tend to overprice on your bill to get some kickback. Good for water sports.The waves were high and strong when I went there so I didn’t enjoy swimming that much but maybe it was good for surfing and other activities. "
Melissa,"Tappen, Canada",May 2018,Very beautiful place. One of the cleaner beaches in Bali. I stayed at a resort just down from a public area and it was so beautiful. Strong current in that area I don’t know if I would think to swim there. 
ntguy,"Brossard, Canada",May 2018,"Nice and long beach stretching some kilometers. Two dozens resort hotel are located on this beach with many more on the interior. We are in May and the wind blowing strong causing big waves crashing on the beach. Do not expect this beach to be like the one in the Caribean. Like anywhere, there are some ambulant vendors selling stuffs but they all belong ti a local coop and with not bother you at all. On the beach restaurants of hotels sells tasty food."
Micheltravel,Netherlands,May 2018,"The reason this beach is thought of the best by a lot of people is the strip of luxury hotels that are situated here. The other beaches on the peninsula, like Queen beach at Jimbaran, Pandawa beach in the South and probably the other in the West is that a lot of the luxury hotels are here. Good choice, but if you just want to sit at the beach and dive into the waves, the others are to me equally good, they are just lacking the luxury. See other reviews too.Easy to reach from Jimbaran or Kuta, just rent a motorbike and drive along the by pass. Can't miss."
Merv17,"Noosaville, Australia",May 2018,Beautiful beach as compare to most beaches at Bali. We stayed at the Westin Resort at Nusa Dua. Which front the beach with other resorts. Found beach to be clean and protected. Good spot for young kids as the water depth is shallow. Water is mostly clear. Not a good place to snorkel as there is not much to look at except for sea grass. Nice anyway👍
Mira P,2 contributions,May 2018,"not only the beautiful beach, it is also a great place to jog! I regularly go there for jogging and it is absolutely fun."
nadia h,"London, UK",May 2018,Beautiful beach. Wi would compare to Seychelles and Maldives where I have also been but for fraction of price
leeannekaren,99 contributions,May 2018,"Pretty beach, not too much pollution. Selected hotels have cleared the rubbish out the front. Very windy this time of year, which is lovely for the breeze but you don’t get the crystal clear calm photos you see in the pictures. Had a massage in the middle of the day, surprisingly didn’t drown in sweat. "
lisahx18,"New York City, NY",Apr 2018,"The beach seems clean at first sight, but after you get into the water, you can see garbage in the ocean. I was a little bit disappointed because I traveled very far to visit this place. There were many cleaner and nicer beaches in the Caribbean (Coki each in St..thomas, Virgin Gorda in Tortola, Little Bay in St. Marteen) or in Hawaii( Lanikai, Hanauma Bay) or in Bermuda (Horseshoe Bay). In order to keep the beach clean, everyone should take their garbage with them ir throw it in the garbage bins. Also, Bali should place garbage bins in the area.  I don't recall any garbage bin in the area.  The Bali government should implement some programs to clean the garbage in the ocean, in long term, people might stop visiting this place due to the amount of garbages. "
Regina M,53 contributions,Jun 2017,"We enjoyed Nusa Dua beach at Hilton Hotel Nusa Dua, it was breathtaking. The sound of wave could put us to sleep as we lay down on the beach. It is relaxing and peaceful. The beach is clean with white sands."
Lerdy,49 contributions,May 2018,The pristine white sand in front of the Laguna welcomes you to have breakfast lunch or dinner or even happy hour right there on or next to the sand 
Abbas Shabbir Marvi,"Karachi, Pakistan",Jan 2018,Whitish brownish sand beach. Very clean & perfect spot to spend your honeymoon. It is not crowded & very clean. Use to love sipping coconut water & enjoy the sea & view. Simply wow
Slgreened,2 contributions,May 2018,"Second time stay and more than impressed with the service and facilities provided. Special mention to Jeany an absolute Gem to the Sofitel, such a gorgeous soul, nothing is too much for her, no ask too great; our children absolutely adore her, as do we! Pool access room an absolutely must, who doesn't want a private pool at their convenience anytime of the day or night ! The tropical gardens are impecable and nothing like we have experienced at any other hotel! Absolutley in lush green tropical garden heaven! The food is A++ catering for every pallet, room service is hands down the best we've encountered from pillow requests to ice, anything you desire is not too much to ask! Rivera lunch is Ah-mazing!! No wonder so many tourists book from other resorts here just for this once a week feast its to die for! We love it!!We are back in 16 weeks 3rd time round and cannot wait! Keep up the good good nothing to fault so far! See you back in Sep! "
Eatforlife1,"Bedford, UK",Apr 2018,"Beware of beach peddlers selling fake silver jewellery. As a retired jeweller we enjoyed a great time at Nusa Dua beach apart from being ripped off from the beach sellers. We bought 3 bangles stamped with 925 (sterling silver mark) they weighed the correct weight only to find they were heavy silver plate over brass. The price paid was 25% over the silver bullion price, so ok didn't lose much money. These beach sellers say they are controlled by Bali tourism & have a number on with yellow jacket  JUST TELL THEM ""NO THANK YOU"""
SW-TA,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018,"The outer reef protects the beach. The ocean becomes a set of tidal pools at low tide, with many interesting marine creatures to discover (but it also means you can't swim or do other watersports half the time).At high tide, not much to see when snorkeling from the beach.The sand is rather coarse. Hotel staff keep the beach quite clean. There is a convenient walking/jogging path along the beach.Lack of non-hotel restaurants unfortunately (but look for Pirates Bay restaurant, highly recommended!)"
toroib,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,location is very good and really beautiful. I think every beach in Nusa Dua is just wonderful and definitely worth to visit. 
Tvler8,"St. Albert, Canada",May 2018,"Because we are here in the off season the beaches were basically empty, which was fine for us. The sand was well groomed."
Stewart F,"Wilton, Australia",May 2018,"We stayed at the Anaya Resort Friendly staff lovely placeBut the food could do with an upgrade , there is plenty for breakfast depending on taste and culture We had a meal in the Restaurant the other night and payed $180 aus and the steak was tough , we also ordered fries with our meal and they came out after we finished the steaks "
Thewayiseeit,"Mosta, Russia",May 2018,"Nusa Dua Bali beach is a long public beach which you can walk along There are many food stalls, massage stalls, vendors, restaurants and hotels along the shore. The beach  has some nice areas but mostly it is full of plastic bottles, plastic bags, odd flip flops, sea grass. Not areas are created equal!! Dogs wander on the beach as well they are harmless."
Elizabeth T,95 contributions,Apr 2018,The beach was very dirty we actually spent time picking up garbage that floated in with the tire. Not a surf beach but good for swimming if you don't mind swimming in plastic garbage. 
madre&padre,Montenegro,May 2018,"Coast is amazing with long sendy beach and beautifull plant and threes whos give deep shadow. Many resort with pool and garden. You can hire sunbeds in resort for 20 euro per person and you got towel and you can use pool. You can hire sunbeds outside resort for 7 euro per 3 hrs per person and you got towel and shower. Hughe minus is dirty sea with plastic, paper, naylon bags etc...on this beach waves not so big."
324MNRao,"Bengaluru, India",May 2018,"Nice beach to visit in the evenings. During morning, it would be too hot with sun shining above you, unless you wish to sunbathe, avoid visiting during many ending hours. "
kazia66,"Rainham, UK",May 2018,The beach itself is fabulous and the see a beautiful blue colour. There aren't many rocks either but it is tidal so in the afternoon the water is really far back. Best to get your swimming in earlier in the day. There is also a small plastic waste problem but the staff are doing their best to clear it away.
Anna B,67 contributions,May 2018,"Beautiful beach. Lovely sand and nice water, but dirty. Even the staff is trying to clean up every day. Is not very nice to swim in it. "
andersjhansson,"Lund, Sweden",May 2018,"This beach is with a lovely view and a perfect spot for seeing the sunrise. Seeing the waves break out by the reef is beautiful in sunrise. The biggest problem with the beach is all the trash, both in the water and on the beach itself. The resorts along the beach employ beach cleaners that mostly rake together that trash and then dig a hole and throw it in there. This results in a clean beach for a couple of hours until the tide  washes out these “trash holes” again. This way of handling the trash results in it being washed out into the ocean again, unfortunately. "
Joe M,"Merrylands, Australia",May 2018,"Nusa Dua Beach is safe, clean and family friendly.  We enjoyed the stroll along the water.Not suitable for surfers  "
Halidya,11 contributions,Feb 2018,Beautiful sand that makes me want to go back. You have to looking around with bicycle and enjoying the scenery !
BarbaraZH,Zurich,Apr 2018,"We've been to many Bali beaches but love this one. It's clean, great to walk, swim and play, easy to walk in and great for kids."
Barry Sloan,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"Great place to relax and have a swim, very reminiscent of the beaches back home..Easy beach to take youngsters too..Take a dip, you’ll love it🏝"
Ashok S,10 contributions,Apr 2018,"It's a good beach to look at. But at low tide, the water is very shallow and you have to go out for about 200 meters to get enough depth to swim. There are many sharp rocks below water. Wearing beach footwear is advised."
JokkeNu,"Vilnius, Lithuania",Apr 2018,A nice beach to spend a lazy day at. Not so crowded and quite and good. We'll worth spending some time at..
FaizalP61,"Sungai Buloh, Malaysia",Apr 2018,Nice beach but slope is rather steep with unconsolidated coarse sand - so hard to walk along the beach without sinking to the ankles ( maybe beech was artificially created.)
ChanD92,69 contributions,Apr 2018,"Not too hot because of a lovely breeze from the sea. Lots of staff clearing the seaweed and bits from the sea and sand constantly . Very relaxing, Not over crowded when we were there and places to get cheap but good drinks and food. Absolutely amazing scenery and a temple which is only a short walk away. "
patro2016,"Navi Mumbai, India",Apr 2018,"The Beach is very clean with surfs. The under current is bit strong, so one has to be careful when entering water."
DavidW1212,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2018,A little bit of rubbish in the water but generally clean and clear. The locals are always out cleaning as apposed some of the other beaches in Bali. Highly recommend.
StevieG400,"Crewe, UK",Apr 2018,"We visited Nusa Dua beach while at the Westin Hotel . The beach was okay , sandy but in the mornings a lot of seaweed and debris was accumulated on the beach . This was a little disappointing as the hotel and grounds were excellent . "
leevickers7131,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,beautiful beach and setting few bars dotted about and some hawkers about but not a pain like some can be shame about the sea hope its not a regular occurrence 
NatureGirl,"Vancouver, Canada",Mar 2018,"This beach is situated in Nusa Dua which is only 15 min away from the Bali airport at Depensar. It has a few large and swanky resorts. The one we chose was call Ayodya hotel which I discovered was on the best and cleanest part of this beach. Visitors from the other hotels walk over to this part of the beach. Ayodya was amazing, but way too large for us. Good for a few nights only. Souvenir shopping just outside the hotel on the main drag is amazing. Prices are cheap so feel free to buy all your gifts there! We traveled everywhere after that and found out later. Great restaurant selection outside. Beach in this area is very polluted which is unfortunate... if you can look aside the garbage, it’s a true blue glittering gem of an ocean here! White sandy beaches and hot sun! Enjoy!"
MsVietnam,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2018,"Nusa Dua is nice and quiet compared to other areas. Best swimming is on the high tide, sand beautiful and not crowded."
Mishmashoflife,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2018,Definitely the better place to go in Bali the rest of them were not great. As soon as we arrived here it was calm no cab drivers hassling you well a couple at the front but that was all. The beach was bliss nice cafes not over populated and really pleasant we got to swim in the ocean. No Rubbish at this beach which was great as the others in Bali let it down.great little bar you don’t need to take too much as it’s all there. It was clean and well kept. Loved the fact security were there it filters out the crap. Worth a visit. 
Lisaontheroad94,Sweden,Apr 2018,It is my first visit to Bali and I am in chock! The ocean is so dirty with floating rubbish I do not want my children to enter the beach or the water. The hotels are trying to keep the beach clean but it is a fight they can not win - the ocean is completely polluted and it breaks my heart to see what we have done to the planet.
Louise J,"Cardigan, UK",Apr 2018,"We were so disappointed when we walked down to the sea from the beach club. Glass bottles, plastic straws, bags and packaging along the shoreline and lots floating in the sea.Another hotel resident found a medical needle washed up too!!The rubbish on the beach stayed there the whole week as we visited the beach twice and nothing had changed.These big name hotel chains using the beach really need to keep the beach clean and safe for their guests as they are advertising their wonderful beach clubs. It was a very sad situation."
Susan W,14 contributions,Apr 2018,Very nice to walk along past some other very nice hotels and you may also see a couple of weddings along the way 
bristolsystems,"Ban Dung, Thailand",Apr 2018,A nice clean long beach with a few places to sit and eat or drink there are a few high end hotels that back onto the beach so their chairs etc are out of bounds but there are some you can rent .the beach itself is very nice with nice white sand and crystal clear water great for a swim 
Pmurphp,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"Beautiful beach shame about the debris. Made a nice change from the hotel pool and some resorts organise daily beach activities,"
Mohitkantalways,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2018,"Nusa Dua beach should be visited in evenings or mornings. Great place to walk ,jog and even participate in Yoga organized by hotel during mornings.You need to register first at desk"
Rukshra,"San Ramon, CA",Apr 2018,"Beautiful beach, but the plastic is just awful. We saw dirty nappies, plastic bottles and even asthma inhalers in the water. The hotels try to do their best by cleaning up the beach but it is an impossible task.Bali has to get ahead of their plastic problem before it is irreversible "
Dave C,"Subic, Philippines",Apr 2018,Quite a lot of plastic debris is in the corners in the northern section of the beaches but I guess that's normal in most places these days unfortunately. It is a good quality Beach apart from that with a nice surf Clearwater and a nice breeze coming off the sea.
Lu M,"Tarrawanna, Australia",Apr 2018,"Growing up in an area back home with the beach at our door this beach has a more tropical feel about it. Please note some of the beaches are private and belong to the resort that it is next to. Saying this a lot of the beaches are for the public. After a visit to Seminyak beach Nusa Dua was much cleaner with minimal litter lining the beach. For a small fee you can access a lot of the private beaches with chair and umbrella hire as well as surf boards and other water crafts. If you do get a chance have a go at snorkeling, with a few easy to access reef it is great for first timers. "
John S,"Ventura, CA",May 2017,It's my favorite stretch of beach with some nice resorts. I prefer the beaches here and the fact there is is a shopping center short distance away by taxi. There are some good restaurants and cafes in the shopping center as well. It's about 20 minutes from the bustle of Kuta and Jimbaran. 
Ranjit Laxman,"Thalassery, India",Apr 2018,"This splendid white sand beach at the western edge of the enclave retains lots of the character that is missing in the santisied Nusa Dua resort zone. Generally safe for swimming and some beach side warungs. A large swathe of the Nusa Dua and Tanunj Benoa beachfront is connected via anice walking path, and morning walks here are especially recommended. The foothpath runs from just in front of the Ayodya Resort in the south for about 7 kms north to the Grand Mirage on the Tanunj Benoa spit. Nusa Dua offers many watersport activites such as banana boating, jetskiing, parasailing, scuba diving and so on."
Anne G,"Northcote, Australia",Apr 2018,"Lovely calm and clean beach. No hassles, water activities available. Great lounges and relaxing environment. Vendors on the beach were pleasant and respectful. "
The Walking Critic,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"I'm an early bird that savours the more tranquil and less hot hours of the day and Nusa Dua Beach is like many others in Bali. Great and safe for swimming, though some times of the year you'll get waste washed up on the sands. This afflicts every beach but is not the case all year around."
Lulu T,119 contributions,Nov 2017,"Been staying in Melia and Grand Hyatt Bali, both situated along the strips of Nusa Dua beach. Very calming atmosphere, less crowded compare to Kuta/sanur/seminyak beach. Most importantly is gentle waves so its save for our little one to play in the water. Love it. "
AnnePND,"Los Banos, Philippines",Mar 2018,you can choose Made. very good and shy local. does not try to upsell. my kids like him.this is his number: +62 852-3865-5766
notnormalman,9 contributions,Apr 2018,"Not a real Bali if you won't go out from the resort.Well overpriced compared to reality of Bali but if you like luxury and reality of Bali overwhelming you, stay inside the bubble."
CarlitosDuke,"Cartagena, Colombia",Apr 2018,"It’s a lovely beach, good for basics when you are by the beach. I only think, the hotels should get together and run cleaning campings. Also the local authorises should get involved. Sometimes you can see lots of plastic by the water and sand.  Think about the environment and the positives will bring having a clean beach. "
keithY651,"London, UK",Apr 2018,"In some respects this is a great beach, in others it just doesn't work. It looks good with waves always breaking on the reef offshore. It has a large tidal reach with shallow water meaning that it you want to swim it is not possible at low tide when the water retreats maybe half a mile. The sand is also not particularly appealing and is not any good for kids and building sandcastles. As someone that likes to jog on the beach in the morning it was impossible as it is the type of sand that doesn't take any weight. However it is shallow and doesn't shelve and therefore it is a relatively safe beach for kids. The beach is lined by mostly hotels that all have their own loungers. There are some locals selling the usual touristy stuff but they are not aggressive and move on if ignored."
panko4,"Samford, Australia",Apr 2018,"Not always the case, as depends on the tides, the resorts  are always doing clean ups of seaweed & rubbish . Safe to swim & fun for  the kids once the tides goes out to poke around in the sheltered area ankle deep."
Paula S,9 contributions,Apr 2018,"Is a huge pity to have a wonderful place ruined like this :( The water is clear, hot temperature, the beach is beautiful but you at Inside an have plastic bottles and packages floating around... felt a great pity of how we ruin amazing natural landscapes like this."
reach_khushboo,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2017,"We enjoyed parasiling, scuba and jet ski... the place is just like any regular beach side, just that it was too crowded... underwater walk and scuba were a good experience though"
Luca C,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,"Quiet, few people, good option of F&B offers.A bit disappointing the clearness of water (dotted with plastic garbage)."
Charvi_Shah,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2017,"nusa dua beach is one of the best beaches of Bali it is must visit place if you are in Bali, amazing breathtaking beauty will surprise you for sure"
KEGZ82,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,We stayed in Westin so the beach is just nearby. There are plenty of people offering ski jet and other water sports. Work hard to negotiate for a much much better deal. We tried the banana boat and the children love it. 
DennyYau,51 contributions,Apr 2018,"We payed an entrance fee to use a resort. Be prepared to pay this fee if you would like a sun lounger and have a place to cool down out of the sun!The entrance fee is worth the money, you get access to the loungers with towels and a drink (may vary depending on resort), you also get to use their shower, toilet and swimming pool! All in all Nusa Dua is a very nice beach, bits of plastic here and there which was a shame - but it wasn't terribly polluted. For food you could eat at the resorts available, or you could walk out to one of the nearby malls where they have some restaurants dotted about. The access to the resorts and close-by mall really helps with planning and spending a day out at this beach"
arorabajaj,"Lucknow, India",Apr 2018,Amazing beach. Clean and serene. Perfect sand and waters. Loved every part of it. The brown sand had it all
Roger R,"Yens, Switzerland",Apr 2018,"The white sand and idillic sea view on the Nusa Penida island in front are pretty much ruined by the uncountable plastic debris floating in the water and washed ashore.Despite some efforts by the staff from the different hotela to collect the junk by hand, the volume is too much to remain unnoticed wheb swimming or walking on the beach.Depending on wind and weather the problem is more or less bad. In the mornings it tends to be the least as the sea is calmer.The issue is not specific to Nusa Dua, as we encountered simmilar situations on every beach in Bali."
Valia Vesselinova,37 contributions,Apr 2018,"very dirty beach and water,horrible .also i lot seller are coming and bothering the guests.i would not come again,awful dirty"
Севдалина Н,"Bankya, Bulgaria",Apr 2018,"A lot of garbage in the sea, the beach cleaning is every day, but is still dirty. And a lot of traders and squirrels "
pamatu049,"Prague, Czech Republic",Apr 2018,"We were at the Ayodya Resort (entrance fee). The beach was clean, staff very nice to us and loved the beach restaurant / pool. Perfect toilets, showers... Pay 500k (3 sunbeds / towels) = 400k spend in the restaurant, so you pay just 100k for towels...Younger kids = morning = big waves. Better to come around 3pm and later."
Martine I,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Mar 2018,"This enormous stretch of beach leads off many beautiful hotels situated in Nysa Dua. There are “buoys” in the sea which demarcate how far one can swim. Sea is lovely and warm and when we were there, very calm. However at “low tide” the sea receded and sand banks were clearly visible! We asked a tour guide who explained that this often happens when there is “ no moon” as opposed to FULL MOON! "
jenniferbwduncan,"Keith, UK",Dec 2017,Lovely safe clean beach with warm clean water. You can walk out quite safely for a good bit before it goes deep.

Ali,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2018,You have the shade of trees along with a warm sea . It is a good place for tanning.You can lie down on the chairs reading books while looking at the sea.It is very nice specially when you are in the 5 star hotel complex .
milly591,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",Apr 2018,We were in nusa dua and this beach was nice but full of algea and sometimes bottles floating and garbage but compared to other beaches at least not too many sellers on the beach you can relax...
Robert S,"Woudrichem, The Netherlands",Mar 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is a pleasant wide and white sand beach, nice for walking along the waves, the ocean swell is dampened bij the reefs a few meters off the coast, at high tide the waves can exert a strong pulling force, however it is never dangerous to swim in the warm and clean sea, at times red warning flags are pinned to warn parents with small children and elderly swimmers for relative strong waves and current"
Megan C,"Umhlanga, South Africa",Apr 2018,"Lovely clean beach, offers tradesmen, swimming , braiding, water sports . When the tide goes out the seabed is full of little surprises to explore and is wonderfully clean. "
Salil C,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,We had heard a lot about dirty beaches in Bali so expectations were low. We were pleasantly surprised - Nusa Dua has a lot of resorts so they keep the beaches quite clean. Lots of water sports options and also good to swim. 
A_Amri,"Manama, Bahrain",Apr 2018,"This is one of the best beaches in Bali as some of the others can collect trash after the rains. Clean beach and good for swimming during high tide, not worth it in low tide."
eglier1,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2018,"Hi,It is a place to visit if you are around, I found it a good place to stay with family and close to the resorts and hotels. Many surfers there but they do not interfere with the swimmers. Some basic restorants can be found over there for a decent lunch.The beach is good but unfortunately we saw some trash in the beach (plastic bags, etc). Even though some people is cleaning the beach in the afternoon it seems that it is not enough to keep it clean. A lot of more work should be done to improve the cleanliness of this place."
empom58,"The Woodlands, TX",Mar 2018,"This is a really great beach. The water is clear, the waves aren’t too big, and the water stays quite shallow for a good distance.  Will definitely return. "
CatherineBH,"San Diego, CA",Mar 2018,"My husband and I hired Putu Bali Driver Tour.  Our first stop from our hotel in Kuta was Nusa Dua.  It is where high class resorts line the white sand beaches.  The vast grounds are beautifully manicured, and the beach is very clean in contrast to Kuta.  We stopped by to see the water blow hole at the end of beautiful park.  The water was calm so the water blow hole was not spectacular.  "

Freedom580933,2 contributions,Mar 2018,Prefer away from 5 star properties around Geger Beach amongst the small warungs with hire beach chair or surf board options.
Janelle D,"Mirrabooka, Australia",Mar 2018,The area is always clean and has lots of beach to choose from. There are lots of hotels that back onto the beaches that have excellent restaurants and bars. You can walk four a few hours along this coastline and see it change with every turn. Recommended for adults who love to explore the many food options and who love to walk. There are also lots of beaches to hire a chair and chill out for the day. 
nixbeley,Singapore,Mar 2018,"Great waters, strong waters which we absolutely loved! Much cleaner than Kuta or Seminyak. We also took the opportunity to ride a jetski which the kids thoroughly enjoyed."
tigger2594,"Toowoomba, Australia",Mar 2018,This is a traditional white sandy beach.Due to its lovely sand it has attracted lots of hotels along the shoreline and they all seem to share it the benefits for their guests.Lovely to wonder along on this warm evening. Some might say romantic. A fellow guest was telling me it was lovely toWalk  Along this morning as the beach faces east and gets the sunrise.
Bradpitt2016,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018,Nusa Dua beach has golden sand that is maintained by the resorts and free of debris and plastic found on some other beaches.There are high quality restaurants along the beachfront that are reasonably priced considering they belong to 5 star resorts.A few vendors but very low pressure.Nice upmarket feel .
B674XIthomasb,"Santa Fe, NM, United States",Feb 2018,"It's an excellent place to stroll along the water, to lounge on the comfortable chaise longues with large umbrellas provided by the St. Regis (service staff will provide cold water, and the beach bar is only a few steps away)"
dobeglobe,"Antwerp Province, Belgium",Feb 2018,Weird title? Maybe! Haha- but what I am trying to say is that Nusa Dua is more for older people or young couples- not a lot of kids running around. The beaches are quite and clean and the water is defintely clearer than in Kuta/Seminyak. You can do great water sport activities in Nusa Dua too. Great for activities + relaxation and less beach vendors than in the south.
Kelly M,33 contributions,Mar 2018,Such a beautiful beach. Lovely to stroll along . Loved all the resorts right on the beach and also the pathway that goes along. We had a young bub and it ment we could take our stroller. Lots of great restaurants along the beach. Perfect for a relaxing holiday or day trip 
キキ今日,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,Water is still pretty clear here at Nusa Dua Beach. It’s safe for kids (especially when its low tide) 
mehtasam,"Ahmedabad, India",Mar 2018,"Nusa Dua is the trademark of Bali. Must visit spot when you are Bali. Activites on beach will keep you busy,"
2torontotraveller,"Toronto, Canada",Mar 2018,"We went to Nusa Dua Beach as part of a shore excursion with Bali Charm.  My friend had wanted to snorkel and this beach was not suitable for this at all.  I think if you are going to snorkel in Bali you would need to rent a boat for this.  It was a nice beach with white sand, and easy to get into and out of the water.  However you needed to wear beach shoes as there are rocks in the water itself as well as some weeds. We also saw some garbage in the water which surprised us as we have not seen that at the other beaches we have been in the world.We ordered drinks so that we could use the table and chairs at one of the vendors casual restaurants. We did enjoy the swim and the quiet location after a day of looking at the sights and sitting in the car."
"Mark Sullivan, NSW Australia",4 contributions,Mar 2018,Do yourself a favour & visit the beautiful sands of a Nusa Dua Beach via a stay at one of the magnificent hotels along the coast. 
Gilang Wardhana,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"The beach is clean, water depth is shallow, wave not so strong, very nice for swimming. The sand more brighter compared to Seminyak beach."
Ibrahim H,"Cairo, Egypt",Mar 2018,Good and calm beach sandy it's beside local beach but still have privacy  you can rebt a bike there with good price .
Amanda-Jo W,"Glenelg, Australia",Mar 2018,"This being my fourth visit to Indonesia, I have visited lots of beaches, Nusa Dua beach is definitely a favourite! I would recommend Nusa Dua Beach some where for families with young children to stay or couples wanting somewhere quiet to get away. The water is clear clean and calm most days. It is not as busy as most beaches. Although we had a beautiful lagoon like pool at our resort we chose to swim in the beach most days. Already planning a trip back with extended family!"
ImranTitil,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"On a sunny day when the weather is good, the beach is just awesome. But, during the low tide, the beach moves further making it unappealing"
Timetravelbug,"Dapto, Australia",Mar 2018,This is probably one of the better beaches in the south of Bali. Personally if you want to experience true Balinese culture and the amazing beaches they have on offer you are better off heading east or north of Bali. Outside the typical tourist areas and away from all the trash that follows 
TravellerNL010,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Mar 2017,The beach at Nusa Dua is absolutely amazing. Clear water and beautiful light brown sand. Well maintained and clean. Seeing the sunrise from this beach is fantastic.
Rafaella Pessoa,"Sao Paulo, SP",Feb 2018,"Located inside a ""turistic complex"", it is full of turists. The water is super clean and blue, different from others beaches around Kuta. It is ideal for swimming!"
DiditP57,"Depok, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Went to nusa dua beach on christmas holiday with big family of 13. The beach has beautiful scenery, clean and quiet compares to crowded kuta beach. It has no waves with white sands which is suits to take the baby and kids to play. "
Cafearara,"Belgrade, Serbia",Jan 2018,"long white sand,  clean water, clen beach, place for volleyball, .Highly recommended.My favorite beach in Bali."
John Paul O,1 contribution,Mar 2018,"very nice place and the sand is definitely pure like hawaii and Boracay, highly recommended for business and couples. "
anton10186,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Feb 2018,I love the beach and well maintain by hotelRecomend for place for family game and sunsetWe was there and enjoy the beach with happiness
clara427,"Newbury, UK",Mar 2018,What a delightful place to stay. The staff are super friendly and very helpful. We were greeted with cold towels and tropical cocktails. The beach and pool areas are maintained very well and they are gorgeous. The breakfast buffet is the best we have had.
Michael T,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018,It’s been around for 30 years but the development still affords holiday makers everything they need from grocery shopping to high end purchases. Restaurants abound and the beach is still pretty clean. No trailer trash here.....🤣
SharenG22,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2018,"A beautiful spot for a walk and a swim, lots of little bays and the beach just goes on and on.  Lots of market stalls selling all the usual items/clothesA great choice of restaurants and cafes for all budgets.Beautiful at night all lit up in front of the many hotels. "
sarahliz68,"Dromana, Australia",Mar 2018,"I would normally stay in Kuta or Legian , first time in Nusa Dua...beach is a lot cleaner , clear water,  quiet. I would recommend 👌"
RayFla,"Melbourne, Florida",Mar 2017,The waves at Nusa Dua get really big. It separates the boys from Men. Quick reallers rolling down the beach. Some of the resorts are territorial. Meaning if you aren't staying keep going. 
Jason B,"Swansea, UK",Sep 2017,"Lovely area, as long as you are staying in one of the beachfront hotels, otherwise go elsewhere. We found 1 place you could get a drink"
JulesReviews,"Welland, Canada",Feb 2018,"I was told this was one of the best beaches in Bali, so we went there one day in Feb 2018. The beach was pretty good, but not awesome.  The sand was good, and water nice for swimming. There were vendors on the beach offering food and drinks at fair prices.  We rented two chairs and umbrella for around $10 US, and had a nice afternoon. My expectations of Bali’s beaches were much higher than what actually exists there.  "
jimmy k,21 contributions,Mar 2018,"Just awesome!!! The beach is clean. You can sew the sands in my picture, they’re so soft. Love it!!!"
Stig M,"Doha, Qatar",Feb 2018,"Stayed at Conrad hotel, can recommend with its great location and service minded staff, have stayed there 2 times before. Nusa Dua beach wonderful sand and clean, perfect to run or just walk."
travelerxhan,California,Feb 2018,"When we were at the Grand Hyatt Bali last time in 2016, we were surprised by how much plastic trash was on the beach and in the ocean. There was hardly any (though still some) this time around. The beach is very beautiful and it's nice that it's private for each of the resorts.There are also lots of water activities that you can do. A lot of reviewers have noted that the cost is much higher at Nusa Dua compared to, say, Kuta. This is true--the costs are about double from that of Kuta but if you don't want to deal with traffic and you're already staying at a resort at Nusa Dua, it may not be worth the hassle to go all the way down to Kuta just to save a little bit of money since you still have to pay for a taxi. For example--a 1 hour surfing lesson plus 1 hour of board rental afterwards is approximately 200,000 rupiah (~$15 USD) at Kuta and 400,000 rupiah at Nusa Dua (~$30 USD). A taxi may cost close to $8 USD each way so you're pretty much at the same price. If you're at Nusa Dua, it makes sense just to do the activities there as well."
Saeid N,"Tehran, Iran",Mar 2018,"This beach is beautiful and so clean in the bali, and absolutely is one of the best beaches  and if you want a good beach for swimming, diving, snorkeling or relaxing, you should visit this place."
Hacendado,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, UK",Jan 2018,"We were in Nusa Dua for a few days and walked to the beach although we didn't spend a great deal of time there.  It was clean and tidy, although not busy.  There were a few refreshment options, but none seemed to have cold beer.  Plenty of options if you want a massage too."
Gary&Theresa,"Durham, UK",Feb 2018,We had spoken to friends who had stayed elsewhere in Bal and all agree the beach in Nusa Dua is the best 
amir,"Tehran, Iran",Feb 2018,"very clean beach , good for swimming and sunbathing white sand ( but not very soft like Phuket ) . you JUST could find expensive bar & restaurant . sun bed & other service are also expensive . in this area you just find 5 star hotels BUT  I went 3 days to that beach . I bought some foods from Kuta and got Uber (about 80000 IDR) and have amazing time , definitely recommended"
Antoni O,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Feb 2018,Enjoy the white sand and blue sea. It's one of the best beaches I have ever visited. It's a paradise.
Francois-Xavier S,"Como, Italy",Feb 2018,"The beach is nothing special, but clean and calm.You have a bench of 5 stars hotel on the front, with good bars and massage stations."
choyyinkong,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,It is a white sandy beach with lot if people visiting the place for swimming and surfing. Near to the beach there is a park to walk around. Saw few hawker stall selling food and drinks around the beach. Nice place to hang out.
TAMember270218,"Jindabyne, Australia",Feb 2018,"Hello, We stayed at the Grand Aston and have also stayed at the Grand Mirage both have very good beach fronts but in front of the Aston was allot better in our opinion, they are only separated by a stones throw but the resorts in question may spend a bit more time cleaning their own backyard, don't know but we liked the beach in front of the Aston and the further you went south, i think it was south seemed to get better.At low tide you can walk out to where the reef starts in front of the Aston, but don't get caught the tide comes in pretty fast.Worth the walk out there.As far Nusa Dua beach itself very nice but seems to get busy, unless you are staying at a resort directly on that beach look at going early otherwise battle with joe public."
Siddhartha C,18 contributions,Jul 2017,One of the best beach in bali with luxurious resorts around and great view of white sand-sea green water combination.The beach is less crowded as almost all the hotels have private beach. You can have surfing and swiming.Donot miss nusa dua while having a vacation at bali.
Jon S,65 contributions,Feb 2018,Walked along a large stretch of sand stopping at various hotels for the shade and a few drinks. The ladies selling goods along the way made haggling fun.
Marta E,4 contributions,Feb 2018,"Nusa Dua Bali beach is amazing, white send super clean, blue sea. Highly recommended. Defenetly come back again."
Venkatesh S,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,Its a clean and calm beach to laze around in the afternoon. A lot of premium properties around. Great for evening walks.
jenny c,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,"I have now stayed in Nusa Dua twice and absolutely love this area. The beaches and water are beautiful,  clean and very inviting. The area is quiet compared to other areas of Bali, a feature i love. There are still good restaurants easily accessible from this area. Having been to Bali a number of times now, I have decided a relaxing holiday in Nusa Dua will always be my future holiday destination when returning. "
diddydiDorset,dorset,Feb 2018,We visited the private part of this beach at the grand mirage bali. The beach is sheltered and oart of it is netted off to make it safer. There are hundreds of speed boats jetskis banana boats eyc so you have to be careful and keep a good watch to not get injured. Lovely sunset though and nice sand. 
Kadek W,36 contributions,Feb 2018,"Enjoy bali,if you want japanes and english driver dont worry i ll assist you in bali, we want make your holliday more componion. "
Darien,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Feb 2018,The beach is extremely clean and the waves are extremely calm and not choppy at all. The sunset was really nice too.
Naran K,"Romford, UK",Feb 2018,"One of best beaches in Bali if you want to just chill and enjoy Bali. As there are mostly five star resorts in this area, the beaches are cleaned and combed regularly. Even though the beach it self is not private it does feel like they are private beaches. "
Alex C,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2018,"My favorite beach in Bali. Long clean stretches of sand with great water. Only complain is that there are few or no roadside stalls where you can have local food/alcohol, so you're out of luck if you don't stay at one of the beach side mega resorts here."
bernieclark2017,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,"We stayed at the Westin resort,which has this beach at its front ,right at the Ikan Restaurant. The beach in either direction has a pathway for walking,running and cycling.The beach is enjoyed constantly by families in particular and there is much to do re water sports etc.the views of the ocean and islands are good."
Nikki A,"Wrea Green, UK",Feb 2018,Beautiful beach with 5 star hotels and bars along the beach edge. The water was lovely to swim in. Very clean. 
Riddhima Sheth,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2018,We rented a cycle to go around Nusa Dua. We saw Waterblow and Nusa Dua beach. Cycling around was fun with great scenery around. Would definitely recommend renting a cycle. 
Freedom755677,10 contributions,Feb 2018,The beach at Ayodya Resort is really really nice and especially the way the Ayodya Resort spills onto it is magnificent. Great design with the infinity pool + beach bar + colourful setting flowing onto the sands.
Alina-Maria M,"Ketsch, Germany",Feb 2018,"This was a great part of Bali that me and my husband really enjoyed. The restaurants, beaches and hotels are really out of this world!"
GEDE_JONY,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"This is one of the best beach in bali,located in south of island, nice view of two small island that call nusadua,also popular with waterblow, and there are also clean area,big hindu statue,large area for kids also to play arround,and of course get sun and just lying down in the white sand beach."
Marynka A,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jan 2018,"If you have small children, this beach is for you. For an adult which likes to swim it is quite boring. The dearest place near the fence is up to the chest. Some places are full with the seagrass, that is why morning swim following the beach will not really work..."
jessiecat25,"Milton Keynes, UK",Feb 2018,"What a stunning beach!, beautiful white soft sand, clear blue waters that are warm and inviting.  It's like a little lagoon with no waves and stays shallow for a long way out giving you the confidence that it's more than safe to relax in the waters.  Little fish can be seen darting about. If you're after banana boats and jet skis whizzing up and down all day long then this isn't the beach for you. Beach cleaners from the surrounding hotels are constantly raking up washed up seaweed and keeping this beach pristine. The only annoyance is the 'lookie, lookie' sales men and women regularly stopping to sell you their wares, but they are friendly and polite and do move on.  I have had worse experiences with this in the world! "
Amin M,"Rasht, Iran",Feb 2018,Nusa dua beach is located near Grand hayatt resort and Bali collection. It was buillt carefully and nicely. It has twe or more pinninsulas and it is comfort place for taking sun bath. 
Neha K,Noida,Oct 2017,"I found the beach overly crowded. It is primarily for water sports lovers. They have a range of activities like parasailing, donut boat ride, flying fish, banana boat, jet ski, glass bottom boat etc. Found a little expensive. Did donut boat ride which was fine, but glass bottom boat ride was not worth it. They claim to show fish below, but we saw none. The beach itself is not very clean. Overall my experience was not so good as I am not into water sports. I realized later that with limited time in hand, could have explored something else. So if you are really into this, then only go. As there are much better beaches in Bali."
POOJAbd,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2017,"In the month of October, Nusa Dua beach is even more gorgeous with the local festival. Food trucks offering local food, games for kids, enough options to shop for coffee and live bands, the Nusa Dua beach festival was simply amazing. The beach was a 5-7mins drive from our hotel. We enjoyed an evening walking around the clean beach and just relaxing with our kiddo. This is a must visit!"
Andalah A,"Uttara, Bangladesh",Jan 2018,Amazing resort with beautiful views and hospitality. Went for our honeymoon and not only did we enjoy the comfortable atmosphere but also the beach and most importantly we loved the area Nusa Dua. It’s heavenly.
Tatiana G,17 contributions,Oct 2017,"It was a perfectly relaxing week on the beach! I enjoyed nicely warm water, sun and sand. All this in Oktober when in my home country is cold and rainy."
Sherly,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Located near a lot of hotels. Watched the sunset here and it looks so beautiful. Don't forget to bring your camera to capture the beauty of Nusa Dua Beach. Not as crowded as other beaches in Bali, perfect place to relax."
Gaurav J,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is a long strip that runs parallel to fancy hotels, it is okayish, mostly hotel guests are to be found on there.It quite a long beachfront but the distance to the water is not that much, so one can sit by the bear while the kids play. It is clean and safe. If you walk towards the opposite side of the pier, you come to the real public side of the beach where locals hang and sellers sell their wares. I would suggest you make the trek. it is worth it.It is not Miami beach if you are staying at one of the hotels, this is more than adequate. I wouldn't get into a cab just to come visit though."
marchelza,"New Bedford, MA",Jan 2018,"In the early morning low tide time, I see people can walk really far away from the beach. Not very crowded. You can also do water sports at the beach"
timothymcnmara666,"Nuneaton, UK",Jan 2018,"The beach was a picture post card , in some parts it sloped significantly and the sand was very soft under foot if you had any difficulties / poor mobility you could easily get into trouble as you sink into sand . We met a couple from Australia who pointed out to us the areas where strong undercurrents could quickly knock you off your feet , not ideal for young and elderly bathers . My wife felt very uneasy in the break waters as you isn't a strong swimmer.Wind surfing, parasailing & kayaking all available and great fun , all the hotel beach bars welcome in non residence which allows you to sample what they have on offer.Overall great beach experience ."
Aydar A,18 contributions,Feb 2018,"I was really surprised by the water quality when I came there. It was absolutely crystal clear so that I could see my toes in the water while being submerged up to my chest in water. No waves at all (because of the coral reef belt surrounding the area in the distance), but there is at times a strong current (strong enough to make standing still on your feet difficult) flowing along the coast line from right to left so be careful. And yeah there are so many beautiful fishes in the water and sea creature, inhabitants of the coral reef! You just need to swim maybe some 20-30 metres away from the shore to find them (and the water will be still up to your neck only).But beware of sea snakes which I saw twice in the water. Although they're mild-tempered and reluctant to waste their venom on us, they attack if provoked. So the best option would be swimming with goggles or snorkeling with a mask and watching where you're placing your feet if you swim far enough from the shore.The beach has clean sand with no rubbish on it. And there weren't many people on it! "
paul k,"Fareham, UK",Jan 2018,"A beautiful beach with golden sands. You can walk to various locations in either direction. Whether it be for shopping, bars or restaurants.A peaceful relaxing environment or as lively as you want it (water sports)Recommend "
LeeDaniel,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Feb 2018,It was a very hot day when we visited the beach. It was a good view and nice scenery. Defiantly a great place to revisit again and of course for surfing. 
Carly L,"Cherrybrook, Australia",Jan 2018,"This beach has nice and fine sand which is great for kids to play with. Sections of the beach are very dirty with lots of debris. Only the sections next to the major resorts are relatively clean. Even though lots of dead coral reef got washed up the beach, it is not a great place for snorkelling - you cannot see much from the water near shore. "
Jonathan R,"Helsingborg, Sweden",Jun 2017,"Clean, white, sandy beaches however tons of tourists and also in some places there's a ""border"" you cannot cross when swimming out. "
Walter S,"Vienna, Austria",Feb 2018,"Guess Raunak is talking about Kuta beach as mentioning Queens indicates!We agree with many others and think Nusa Dua beach between the Las Vegas like Mulia and the beautiful landscaping of the Gran Hyatt is a relaxing little paradise.Clean nearly white sands, moderate waves and just enough guests to not make it feel deserted.The paved walkway from one end to the other links some beautiful properties, all open for guests, not for locals!Nothing is cheap here, but why should it be? Well maintained creating a lot of work for locals. We love to come back to our little paradise after a day in the Bali reality outside Nusa Dua."
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,Best beach so far in Bali. This area translates as 'two islands' and there are two beaches either side of the volcanic where the 'Water Blow' feature is located.Effectively a privately owned beach - owned by the dozen or so 'resorts' and certainly far different from most other parts of Bali.2186
Raunak_jain23,"Jodhpur, India",Feb 2018,Crowded dirty beaches. Watersports were very costly and had to negotiate a lot. Would not be coming again for sure. Best place to eat indian food was QUEENS. Superb food. 
Lucy B,"London, UK",Jan 2018,"The beach is quiet as it doesn't have the typical large waves. It is very pleasant to swim there, especially during the low tide. The beach is clean. Probably one of the best beaches in Bali to swim in. Surrounding hotels have own beach chairs but there is also a public area. I felt very safe there."
lokeshj847,"Calangute, India",Jan 2018,A place for couples to go and have a relaxing trip. Visit to the beach is a must. A good shopping area nearby called Bali collection. Lot of eating and shopping options
Luke H,12 contributions,Jan 2018,Very beautiful and the sand is kept clean. The water is shallow for a long time. Great for children but watch out for rocks in large patches under the water. A little rubbish under the water. I think most of the beach is owned by resorts and so you can’t use their area unless you pay $$$.
Ajoy2b,"Harbor Springs, MI",Jan 2018,What can be said about a beach in Bali besides fabulous.  All the fabulous resorts are along Nusa Dua beach with a meandering walkway.  We took a daily walk on the beach taking in all the beautiful resorts.  If you’re adventurous you can rent a surfboard or even get a massage on the beach.
Jennifer M,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,Went here because we are staying at Nusa Dua beach resort. Nice beach clean and got for sunbathing from the hotel garden.
Caroline T,"Ballarat, Victoria, Australia",Sep 2017,Nusa Dua and now Benoa are the premium must stay locations if you want a romantic escape or family stay. It is a good 20-30 mins from airport and kuta but kuta and legion are fine for shopping and a constant party but not very relaxing.  If you want luxury and true relaxation this is where you want to be.
Ilyas450,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Jan 2018,Probably the best beach in Bali. Really nice and clean. The beach is sort of private for residents of nearby hotels but everyone can go in.
totestravels99,44 contributions,Jan 2018,"Beautiful, clean, relaxing - what more can you want. Best beach in Bali! We have stayed at Nusa Dua twice (recently and about 3 years ago) and we could not wait to come back to Nusa Dua. We love walking from end to end along the path and seeing all the incredible resorts."
Mamba_11,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2018,"This is a must visit beach if you are in Bali for vacations. The entire area is actually developed for tourists. There are nice hotels which open up to this beach, so you may sit anywhere and order food and drinks. Water is very calm since it has a big Bay area, where waves don't form, son in case you are surfer, you might not get the right kick here."
Robsworldtoday,"Bristol, UK",Jan 2018,Clean well maintained and beds ..plenty of sports..walks..sea is very safe and warm...the workers and security are an amazing asset in the running of this beach. 
Augustin Daniel C,"Bucharest, Romania",Dec 2017,"Nusa Dua has a great beach, white sands which are very clean, just like the water. Nice place for getting tanned. It's a little bit difficult to swim, because of the ocean currents."
SickReviews,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,The water is surprisingly warm and the ocean looks beutiful from where you sit on the beach. Definitely recommend going.
Andrea G,"Mentone, Australia",Jan 2018,"What's there to say about a beach that hasn't been said before? This beach is pristine clean, turquoise blue & heavenly warm! The sand (so we found out) was very very coarse. It is almost like teeny pebbles. It's lovely & smooth, but a little chunky in the hair...& bathers... & everywhere else! Beware LOL!!! The beach wasn't overly packed & most sections are cordoned off for the various hotel club areas. Gorgeous beach, don't forget your hat & sunscreen!"
Pauls1692,"Townsville, Australia",Jan 2018,"Clean water, lovely beach sand and nice to walk along.  There is a footpath that runs along most of the resorts so if sand is not your thing, it is still easy to view, enjoy and experience.  Lots of hotels have seating space and allow you to order providing you pay cash.  Markets and hawkers are on the beach as well.  "
wanderlust119,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2018,Great beach! There’s a lot of surfers and SUP rentals along the beach. We stayed at Inaya and really enjoyed a cool drink while lounging on the beach. 
asti d,Indonesia,Jan 2018,"If you visit bali, dont miss this place!!!!!Nice place with clean and good view.You can enjoy this place with family, couple, or solo."
Kiran R,"Hounslow, UK",Jan 2018,I think the pictures say everything - fantastic!. Clean...quite...Easy to get to. Not much hassle from local traders. Good security. Most luxurious hotels have private beach.
Claudio D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,It is one of the best place in Bali where to go to the beach if you are not a surfer.Many blues color on the Ocean. Calm water.White Sand.Bring a sun shield... Or cream.Tanning factory. %-) 
mbruce28,"Kakinada, India",Jan 2018,"The beach was so nice in comparison the the beach at Seminyak. White, soft and clean unlike the one in Seminyak which is dirty, hard and covered in plastic debris"
316swagatag,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jan 2018,A beautiful beach to relax & also good for Surfing 🏄‍♀️.A must visit if you are planning a trip to Bali.
ashishpaliwal,"Hyderabad, India",Dec 2017,We went to the beach around day time to try some water sports as this beach is famous for it. The view at the beach are pretty good but it felt bad to have dirt lying around in some areas. The cleanliness is not totally maintained.The water temperature was idle for swimming though.
ShivaniMoodley,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2018,"The waters are absolutely beautiful and breath taking. The beach is very clean, the ocean is clean. I honestly did not see litter on the part of the Nusa Dua beach I was on. Where I was, the sand was freshly raked every morning and saw the workers cleaning up anything on the sand including seaweed- hence the sand is very well maintained. Nusa Dua beach is one to visit. "
Eanna57,460 contributions,Jan 2018,"A nice sandy beach where the hotels each have their own particular patch. Peaceful and relaxing, each hotel is responsible for the cleanliness of their own areas. Usual beach traders for sports and souvenirs but they are not too intrusive. Good sand and safe for swimming."
Sarah R,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2018,Lovely day spent outside though be more mindful of applying sunscreen than I was... We are here in January and it has been overcast/raining a lot so be mindful of the time of year you are travelling if you want a sunny experience!
thehungrytraveller10,"George, South Africa",Jan 2018,"It is so hard to see these beautiful beaches and the ocean in the state that it is in. There is plastic everywhere. The little piece of beach outside of our hotel was kept fairly clean, but if you walk a little way along you see how an unkept beach next door looks. There is so loads of tiny polystyrene pieces everywhere. When we did an outing to do the sea walk I was shocked to see all of the rubbish floating on the water. Time for the government to initiate some sort of cleaning plan....seriously!!"
dagoeh,34 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice Beach, we swam on this beach about 4pm, just behind Ayodya hotel. warm water and clean area. it has another facility like sea walker, banana boat etc"
nareshojha,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Dec 2017,"Sofitel resort beach front is very nice with on the beach restaurant and place to have therapies. If you walk down there different hotels with their beachfront restaurants, which one can enjoy too."
McTed,"Shellharbour, Australia",Dec 2017,We stayed at Novotel Nusa Dua and their beach club is on Nusa Dua Beach. The beach and water were clean and the water is warm. There was a strong cross current though that weak swimmers should watch out for
KatrinJ_est,"Tallinn, Estonia",Jan 2018,"Its way more beautiful than Kuta beach and cleaner than Sanur one. Great place to swim with kids as well, just be aware that it gets deep quite quickly "
andi k,jakarta,Jan 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is one of the most beautiful beach in Bali.. We visited here during the new years holiday and it was very good, beautiful sand, clean and safe for children. The wave is blocked few metres away from the edge, so the children are safe to play.Will visit back..!"
STEVE F,"George, South Africa",Jan 2018,We stayed at Nusa Dua and were not disappointed. It's very different to the island of Lembongan. One can walk for miles along the paved walkways in front of many classy resorts and hotels. One can take a dip every few minutes along the entire stretch of the ocean front. The waves are gentle and calm and one can bob about for hours in the azure sea.  There are numerous sarong and dress stalls and many beach activities for the energetic. The beach bars are very special as one can enjoy a meal or an icy Bintang at any one of the resorts along the Nusa Dua beach. The beaches are uncrowded and more family oriented. If you are looking for huge surfer waves this is not your spot. It is more commercial but one can find a shady spot under a tree on the beach and enjoy a gentle morning people watching or soaking up the sun! 
Naveen Reddy,"Bengaluru, India",May 2017,A very good and nice place and also a must visit place in Bali. Especially the creation of water falls in the lime stones of beach when the waves hit the lime stones. It was an amazing experience to watch the same.
JUSTINE-JESSE,"Pretoria, South Africa",Jan 2018,A clean beach with small waves. Not the prettiest beach I’ve seen. Fairly empty . The sand is not as white and fine as in some other countries! Water sports available. 
hart277,"Chicago, IL",Jan 2018,"The sand is not fine, but just small pebbles, so once you get a few feet into the water the pebbles get bigger and not as comfortable as fine sand, the water was warm but be careful as it was the most powerful ocean I’ve every been in. "
Glenn M,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jan 2018,"Great beach, clean and safe for swimming. Warm water and clear. Close to restaurants and service provided by hotels. "
Horst S,"Norrtalje, Sweden",Jan 2018,"We really enjoyed the beach. I went to different spots on the beach for surfing, we did some snorkeling (only saw few fishes though) and swam a lot.Due to the wind direction, there was some rubbish in the water on some days. Also, the current was quite strong some days."
katiebiks,surrey,Dec 2017,Nice beach with cafes and hotels along the path. Water sports available. Theres really nothing else to say
emmagilmour1,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,seaweed is everywhere.   I noticed in some of the bigger resorts - Ritz Carlton & The Mulia they had clean sands and water.   It was hard to navigate in the water to sandy bottoms with so much seaweed
Dimas A K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,Clean beach with fine white sand. The waves so quiet and the wind so calm make us relax and want to sleep under the tree. Access to beach embarrasing but Nusa Dua complex is modern and so many Hotel & Resort around there.
TrueHotelReview,Scotland,Dec 2017,"The beach is nice, with soft sand and shallow waves. We felt safe taking the children into the water since the waves weren't big.  I think access along the beach is only for the various resorts that join onto the beach, although there were quite a few sellers along the beach."
Oka A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Come and visit Nusa Dua Resort complex, you won't regret...It's a manage area with lots of hotels, mall (Bali Collections) and restaurant with Nusa Dua beach in it, the beach so beautifull...Recommended to stay 1 or 2 night at this complex."
Fiona Conder,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Dec 2017,"Nice white sand beach, there is a enery fee of around 2000 0r 3000 ( 20 cents ) depending where you enter, or sometimes just a car park fee when you leave 10000 we found it was nice waves, water was not to bed one day and the next it was very dirty, so depends on the weather "
LoveTravel705693,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Jan 2018,Clean and beutiful beach has one of the best sea views with a nearby park and watersport activities.
jmajumdar,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Dec 2017,Good and clean beach. Had a nice time with my family. Good food stalls nearby. Had a good outing. Recommended
Rifat,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jan 2018,"We went there to do some water activities.... we did snorkeling ... it was ok but after that we ride on a banana boat , it was dangerous as we fell down from the boat ... water was clear .... we couldn't do paragliding as weather was not good.... "
Andre S,72 contributions,Jan 2018,"If you think that you have paid for an expensive hotel and that's gonna give a nice and relaxing holiday at the beach, the jet ski will prove otherwise.You're not allowed to swim any further than 15m at this shallow beach with no waves."
livvymonkey12,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2017,We had body massage on the beach under the comfy breeze in a really worth price (USD25 per hour)!! Many tourists tried this after we did (as it might appear a bit embarrass to do massage in the open area).
Johan-finsteen,"Egedal Municipality, Denmark",Dec 2017,"It is really sad how this beach like most of Bali is polluted and full of plastic. We where told “it comes from Java” or “it is from the rivers, cause it rained” . Well there is garbage everywhere when you drive in Bali jungle, rivers, sea, cities and roads. Do something about it it is your responsibility and you will loos tourist to other destinations in the long run."
bobsabran,"Bogor, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Clean, quiet, semi exclusive beach but you still can walk along even you are not hotel quests.. still have fishermen boats around it"
duke167,New York,Dec 2017,"a very long beach with clean sand and water, red flag is on so we didn't swim.In the early morning low tide time, I see people can walk really far away from the beach."
Madhusudan S,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2017,Should visit if in nusa dua. Good for sunbathing. Not very crowded.You can also rey water sports at the beach
Cycorp,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Have been to Nusa Dua Beach numerous times over the years and there are exceptional areas as well as just basic areas.One of the better ones is the beach near the Conrad Hotel.Great waters, strong waters which the kids absolutely loved!We also took the opportunity to ride a jetski which the kids thoroughly enjoyed. The ‘beach access’ for the Grand Whiz hotel was mostly rocky. "
Natalie P,"Mermaid Beach, Australia",Dec 2017,"I don't think you go to the Bali for the beaches as there are whiter and cleaner in the world.  But as far as Bali goes, this one is pretty good.  I actually wenrt swimming in it.  Much cleaner than Kuta or Seminyak. Quiet and calm."
Jeffrey51,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2017,Very warm water but not too deep.  Good access to all the hotels for refreshments  Be careful we did see a snake on the beach /surf last night
19bugzie60,18 contributions,Dec 2017,"Dropped into Nusa Dua for a quick swim, beaches were clean and the water was crystal clear, surprisingly not crowded. A cold Bintang at the Fleet Bar made the day."
Thelly76,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,"Nusa Dua Beach is everything peopleSay and more! Private, clean and cleansing.   Beautiful white sands, few hawkers and lots of tanning or chilling out space to share. "
eglobal2015,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"Wide stretches of fine white sand. Clean.Clear sea. Shallow for distanceYet can have variety of water sports, e.g. surfingNo wonder it is world famous"
ben_41071,4 contributions,Dec 2017,"It 's a beautifull beach we just need 10 minutes to find it by bike. It' a great place to visit. While enjoy the beach, we can have some food in the left or rightside waroengs. Sure we will coming again!"
raymolbert1,"Delray Beach, FL",Dec 2017,"This was a beautiful and quiet beach. Water is clear and there were surfers out on the waves. When we went it was rainy and the sea was rough, but we still enjoyed it. I would recommend! "
tigerchik,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2017,"Loved Nusa Dua beach, recommend going to Agendaz on the Beach...awesome food, service and music!! Lovely spot to just take in the views."
Mihkel T,"Tallinn, Estonia",Dec 2017,"Some of the beaches in Bali are guite polluted with garbage (its not the fault of balinese, but their countrymen somewher in the north who dump their stuff into th ocean). Nusa Dua Beach is so far the cleanest I've seen here and also there are not so many people trying to sell you stuff that you actually don't want to buy. "
Roscoe G,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2017,Lovely beach and great location. Cleanest we've seen. All allowed to use beach but loungers and shade mostly for hotel guests use only.  No other sun loungers for public to rent. Had drinks and pizza at Melia resort just to sit and watch the ocean and try to spot mount agung through the clouds. Would be a great view if not for overcast weather 
Paul M,"Williamstown, Australia",Nov 2017,Great beach area with lots of hotels. Many places to have massage ora cool drink or snack. Will return.
hd19741,england,Dec 2017,The hotels in Nusa Dua are all excellent with good beach front locations and good restaurants.If you want a more authentic Balinese experience I would recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as it is the original hotel with beautiful Balinese structures and facilities.The beach is always clean and the local sellers are all controlled. The nearby Bali Collection of shops and restaurants is a 15 minute walk away and provide a good shopping experience.
Farici,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"This beautiful beach spot is very clean with white sand, and also have a bicycle/jogging track, and beautiful view while sunrise"
Viking,"Boksburg, South Africa",Dec 2017,"A truly incredible beach with Crystal clear water and Mt. Agung as a backdrop. We were at the Sofitel Nusa Dua hotel, so we were also supplied with cold refresher towels regularly. The beach is very clean too. "
Lida H,5 contributions,Dec 2017," Beautiful scenery with clean beach.. very near to our bali nusa dua hotel, can easily reach the beach by walking"
영록표,"Incheon, South Korea",Jun 2017,very nice and beautiful place to take restthere are lots of beautiful spots and nice restaurants !!
VirgoQualitySeeker47,Australia,Nov 2017,"Lovely beach, back of beach nr Hyatt has trees and loungers for guests only. There are security guards on duty.There are people trying to sell watches, sarongs, etc., which is a bit of a nuisance. There are more hotels further along the beach which are less quiet."
caddyandbellA,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2017,No wonder people choose to holiday here with their children.Very quiet and clean waters on pristine sand beaches.Lots of exploring to do with tourist lookouts to Mt Agung.
AnkurThakuria,33 contributions,Nov 2017,It's one of the most popular beaches in Bali. The only downside being its flocked all day around. Some great food places here as well and its close to the city center.
Yeremia P,Indonesia,Dec 2017,"Definitely enjoy this beach more than Kuta, Legian, Seminyak area. The beach is quite and close to many luxury hotels in Nusa Dua. They also offer water sports."
George_mile,20 contributions,Dec 2017,"peninsula island is very nice palce to do an exercise because it has very clean area and the air is very fresh,very recommended place to relax ,and that it's very close with water blow,which water blow is famous place in nusa dua with his big waves then crashing into the rock."
Kathy121212,"Worcester, UK",Nov 2017,"As we were guests at the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, we used their private beach club facilities - sunbeds and bar/restaurant. There are toilet and shower facilities too. The beach is walkable distance from the hotel and as it was mid-November (so cloudier and no searing heat), it made for a pleasant stroll via the shopping mall to pick up some beers! As other reviewers have highlighted, the sea go out some way at low tide, but the beach is clean and ideal for paddling if you don't fancy the hike to the breakers!"
roger-husly,9 contributions,Dec 2017,This is one of the famous beach in Bali. So many people coming here. The place is so beautifull and clean. I come here with my family. My children was very happy playing in the sands and swimming in the beach. We will come again.. 
amin a,25 contributions,Oct 2017,"The beach in Nusa Dua have no sunset because its positition, they have a great sunriseThe sands is fullfill with rock so u must extra carefull for walk there and the wave in the beach is calm and the water is clear so you can see alot of little fish arround...But if u stay in hotel with a private beach is gonna give an advantage"
Dawncg,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"A lovely clean beach , shallow waters for swimming .  There are lots of activities if that's your thing. "
Sergii C,"Sanur, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Stayed with my family at the end of September. Very nice hotel, friendly staff. My daughter enjoyed kids pool so much, that it was very hard to get her out of it. We will definitely come back and stay longer."
squerpans,22 contributions,Dec 2017,"it really is a great place, a very unique atmosphere, I love being in this place and the natural scenery makes me comfortable"
Matt G,"Tilbury, UK",Dec 2017,"We stayed at the Melia Bali Indonesia so we’re at the end of the beach by the peninsula. Lots of people selling stuff, all good people and not pushy at all. Happy to stand and chat even though they know you’re not interested or will leave you be if that’s your preference. Water sport is available and if you want to. I’d suggest it if you want more than a paddle you’ll need a boat to go out the channel and through the break. Snorkelling is a must. Always haggle!!!"
barksbys,"Colchester, UK",Nov 2017,"The beach was beautiful, clean and a lovely walk to the water blow.The currents are strong so be aware and stay fairly shallow, you can gage this by the colour of the water. "
The Travelling Familia,"Tarneit, Australia",Nov 2017,"Loved it! The sand was white and soft, beach was clean and the water was calm.After going to Legian beach this was 100 times better and what I had expected.Stunning"
Ann-Shirley G,"Vancouver, Canada",Nov 2017,Walk the beach for exercise and pleasure.  Explore the resorts along the way.  Take a quick did to cool off.  Go shell seeking but be sure to cover up to protect from the sun.
pradnyasari,59 contributions,Nov 2017,Nice beach in nusa dua good for your relax many restaurant and shop in this area you must be come here
futbolmania999,"Beirut, Lebanon",Aug 2017,These are the beaches that indonesia is known all over about. Beautiful and Clean white sands. Its quite peaceful too as its secluded.
shrey20152015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"Clean white sand beach,gated area.Near many 5 star hotels. Beautiful views, nice blue waters, good place to spend an evening."
franzico m,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"love this place .. really love the atmosphere , not so crowded and not many local come .. the beach location is quite far from kuta or denpasar , but worth it to visited"
janefromcairns,"Cairns, Australia",Nov 2017,"Gated 5 star hotel enclave . Pretty beach , clean and safe very few people selling stuff .  I really liked staying in the area - there is less to do less restaurants etc but if you just want to hang out at your hotel then this is the area to stay . "
Dhaivat03,"Vadodara, India",Jul 2017,"Its beach where most of the water sports activity is done in Bali. Sea is quite, clean and good for water sports. Also beach is private at many places occupied by 5star resorts."
Lian Tiong G,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Nov 2017,The Nusa Dua beach is a long stretch of fine sand. Several hotels are located along the beach. Beautiful blue water as backdrop with boats make the scene pictureque. We have our morning walk along the beach and watch the sun rises as early as 5.30 am.
pilypop,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Nov 2017,"Literally the ONLY beach in Bali that isn’t covered in rubbish and is also cool to do a bit of snorkeling. Also the only beach that isn’t unpleasant to get to, most beaches I’ve visited here have messy paths to get down to a very small beach littered with trash and are a mission to find and not worth it. Nusa Dua is definitely worth visiting! "
Vanessa T,2 contributions,Nov 2017,Lovely beach Clean & today A few bars & hotels to walk around Views stunning Security managing most areas 
F3753MHhelenp,4 contributions,Nov 2017,The water is very clean except for the seaweed...I watched them clean the sand and what they do is rake the seaweed and then dig holes on the beach to bury it in...I think this is why there seems to be more seaweed some days compared to others because depending on the tide washing it back in. The Balinese selling their wares on the beach dont bother you..once you say no they walk away unlike Kuta and other places in Bali..compared to Seminyak and Kuta the beach in Nusa Dua wins by far...it is also a beautiful walk after dinner along the foreshore past all the other hotels with elegant bars on the beach and restaurants.
SanWa Journeys,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Everytime we went to Bali, we always looked for a beach without so much crowded and had a glimpse of white sand. So the decision was always Nusa Dua which also near to the town and airport. We, especially me, always love being there.But of course we could not see sunset in this part of Bali. And it was and is always windy although sunny."
Liz T,"Leigh, UK",Nov 2017,"The beach is long with great sand and shallow water to swim in. The only downside to this beach is it is noisy with so many jet skis, paragliders, banana boats etc whizzing up and down"
elies2017,"Beveridge, Australia",Nov 2017,Pristine beach with very clear clean water and lovely rolling waves with enchanting views of nusa lembongan and nusa penda the refreshing water was a joy to swim in.
Van V,7 contributions,Nov 2017,"Very clean beach, sand was nice and the water was always warm. Great atmosphere,    Very spacious beach "
yorosey,"Las Vegas, NV",Nov 2017,Was impressed with for how the most part it was clean. Great to walk along or go for a swim. Sunrise and low tide is a nice combination as well.
Azur S,"Southport, Australia",Nov 2017,"Great Dine! Professional Service!I can't believe words can express how great the dish here. Everything is amazing. Beside of the beautiful-look food served, they taste really good. The flavour of seasoning, freshness, and the ambience are blended beautifully. Needless to say, the service was uniformly excellent, professional, and attentive. The place is nice and quiet, elegantly furnished, and so classy. I don't really matter the price noted, the food has blinded me satisfyingly."
Priyankara D,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Nov 2017,"This place is really calm and suitable for swimmers. I spent more than 4 hours in water and had so much fun with friends. Specially, the sea is wide and safe with soft waves, You will enjoy a lot!"
Ojassy,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"As expected when you're in a posher area, beach is clean but waves abit strong during our visit. Long stretches of white sands, not much happening besides relaxing. There's a Shangri Las hotel under construction by the beach that's something to look forward to."
tripguy045,australia,Nov 2017,"For all of the carry on about how good bali is, i can’t say I’m too impressed. Sydney has some of the best beaches in the world, so I’m probably spoiled for choice back home.The only positive thing I have to say is that with a young daughter who is a a little afraid of waves, the water is very calm and presents almost no danger."
William H,"Wakefield, UK",Nov 2017,"Currently staying at the Melia Bali , right on the beautiful and Peaceful Nusa Dua beach. The beach is spotlesley clean and free of many jet skis (only seen 1 in 10 days) there is plenty of water sports if needed as a there is a man walking around with prices but isn't at all pushy. He just radios to the next bay if anyone needs anything.There are possibly 6 sellers who walk around awaiting yr wave , they leave you alone straight away if you say no thanks. Each hotel has security guards at their entrance and peace and quiet is their priority so a peaceful day is guaranteed. "
mpatoga,"Ourense, Spain",Nov 2017,"We were in The Mulia hotel and with direct access to the beach. Nice,clean and beautiful. Not noisy and safe beach.  What else you need?"
Jessica W,"Rosetown, Canada",Nov 2017,This beach was quiet. It had some seaweed in the water and the sand had a lot of shells. It wasn’t the best beach I have ever been to but it was alright. The water was calm close to shore. 
yinic,"Atlanta, GA",Nov 2017,Expensive place to stay and eat. Then you may have to leave the site to find great local eats. Too many chain restaurantsYou can stay off the beach and just come for the day visit.
mobydick59,"Broadbeach, Australia",Oct 2017,access difficult Lots of painful pebbles .. Not the best beach. We have better beaches in Australlia
Bojanaaa,49 contributions,Oct 2017,"For me, since I’m not the surfer type this was far the best beach on Bali, nice white sand with blue water like from postcards... in some areas the tide gets really low so it doesn’t look very nice, but overall beautiful beach,not crowded at all. Only thing that is somehow inconvenient is that all the nice resorts are here so if ur not stayin there u’ll just have to grab a towel and stay on the sand, still u can use the beach bar and restaurant from some of the resorts which is ok, if u want to get out of the sun and stay in the shade for a bit"
Heather R,16 contributions,Nov 2017,Nice beach although sun beds a little ad hoc. Also some rubbish in the water which is a shame. Comes to life at night but not amazing in the day
Øystein V,"Tysnes, Norway",Nov 2017,"Great beach, but not the best for swimming. Low water level even at high tide. In low tide the water will almost dissapear completely. Very beautiful and kids friendly."
Marta P,10 contributions,Oct 2017,"Such a great beach! Beautiful view of volcano, spectacular sunsets and great restaurant all around where you can chill out and still enjoy the views."
karenchristelle,66 contributions,Nov 2017,We got here at about 10am and it was still quiet and peaceful. The beach was still cool and breezy. You can easily walk around and see both sides of the beaches. Many resorts around too but i did not stay in any one of them. We spent about 40 minutes here before heading on to our next tour spots. Worth a stop!
alison h,"Nuneaton, UK",Oct 2017,"Clean, safe beach and although there were people selling goods, they did not hassle you if you made it clear you did not intend buying anything."
Serene S,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,Nusa Dua is undeniably one of the prettiest beach in Bali and it was very calming to see a clear blue skies. Even found some puppies to play with! The only thing that surprised me was that there was some littering but not outside of the hotel I was staying at but towards the other resort.
Angelique C,Trinidad,Oct 2017,"This beach is lovely, it has many hotels on the length of the Beach. There is also the Water Blow that you can visit close by- I suggest that you go when its high tide. "
sunhasan,"Mississauga, Canada",Sep 2017,"A very good place for watersports. Look for Arjun watersports. Reasonable, negotiable, donot compromise on any activity. Superb scuba trainers, all other activities including parasailing, jetskiing etc, very good. Try going early morning. "
Let's Go Sightseeing,"Noida, India",Jul 2017,This beach is famous for water sports but these are quite expensive. The facilities are well provided for though. The beach itself needs a little more cleanliness.
SMYTHTRIBE,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,We love the beaches at Nusa dua. With various little lagoons and varying scenery they are far nicer in my opinion than seminyak. 
Napeer,2 contributions,Oct 2017,"Had nice facilities for watersports. But need to bargain with service providers.  We experienced Sea walker for the first time, it was really nice"
Gourlaybankterriers,"East Lothian, UK",Oct 2017,"Well kept, lovely long and wide beach.. staff at Grand Bali Hyat keep their area very well maintained and clean, much appreciated"
_Raven_4,"Whistler, Canada",Oct 2017,It was beautiful! They will not rent out boards some days until 2pm because the tide is so low at times.  
griszkon,Poland,Apr 2017,"Beach is beautiful and very long. The only thing is that when you try to get into the water you have to wade through the junk buffer. They clean it very offer but still lots of rubbish comes out.Anyway, this place is very nice and I would love to go back there."
Reza R,"Vancouver, Canada",Nov 2017,As the tides go and return couple times a day its nice to walk in the shallow water and see lots of fish and crabs.
Swati T,9 contributions,Oct 2017,We did sea walk and parasailing at this beach. It was great fun. Didn’t really spend time on the beach though but I think this is the only beach worth going to. Others are pretty mediocre.
Ontracc,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"If you like a quieter atmosphere then this is worth the time to visit. Away from the hussle of Kuta and Seminyak, Nusa Dua beach offers luxury hotels, bars and plenty of shade to relax in and just let the day roll by. We strolled from pirates bay to the north along the beach Promenade stopped at Tamarind for lunch and a drink, see seperate review. High end hotels and clean beaches with viewd to Lombok island. Best suited for families with children and anyone who wants a relaxing hassle free holiday.Prices will be higher here for most things so get a great hotel deal early for off season value. It's worth it."
david l,"1,937 contributions",Oct 2017,"I am inspired by the designers of each beach spot of the five star hotels.   To walk somewhere different.  To take risk.  What ever people eating near the beach, should wake up the next morning thinking about the symphony of fine dishes with humming of waves.  The experience shows what a great rambling could be.  "
Blunden123,"Basingstoke, UK",Oct 2017,"Stayed at one of the hotels backing on to Nusa Dua beach.  It is a very long beach with safe swimming areas marked by buoys. The waves are small, so you can go to water and swim. When the tide is out you can walk a fair way out in safety.A quiet beach, that is ideal to relax and chill out on."
Pritesh M,"Leamington Spa, UK",Aug 2017,"From the hotel we were able to get on to the beach. It is clean and very pleasant. Only thing is that the low comes from midday onwards so if you miss it, you'll have to wait till the morning. Also, there are a lot of activity peddlers on the beach. They are good, but sometimes it does get annoying when you are trying to relax."
Elaine L,"Mount Samson, Australia",Oct 2017,"A lovely beach with clean, white sand and clear water to swim in. Very pleasant to take a stroll along and not too many hawkers to bother you. Very nice. "
Shivani P,6 contributions,Sep 2017,"So one thing you need to know about Nusa Dua (I didnt know this when I visited) is that in the afternoon time, the water goes WAY in away from the beach line making it impossible to swim in. However, this changes around 4pm in the evening when the water comes back. The best beaches to visit are definitely Geger beach, however it is very crowded and pretty expensive of you dont stay in the Mulia resort. From my personal experience, unfortunately we only discovered this on the last day, is the beach where the Pirate's Bay resort is on. On this beach, not only is it very free and un-crowded, you get the best beach chairs! We had this circle purple beds and they were the most comfortable relaxing beds ever. Theyre not even that expensive. Dont waste you time going to a beach infront of a hotel unless you're staying in that beach front hotel. On the whole, Nusa Dua beaches are definitely the best Bali has to offer. "
Sameer Nandan M R,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2017,"The beach falls towards the south western end of the Bali. A stip of land with blue water beaches on two sides. For an ideal swim and a nap on the sands, suggest the right side beach when facing the statues. The left side beach is more an activity beach. Do NOT miss the water blow that lies behing the big statue. It would be one amazing experience"
Hettie1956,"Sheffield, UK",Oct 2017,The views at night are so beautiful.  Either sitting at the Arawana restaurant or the kul kul  bar just breath taking. 
Tony D,"Sandton, South Africa",Oct 2017,Water very low at low tide so get there when at least half way or walk along beach to operate as. But good beach. Safe for bathing
denis,"Rockland,Ontario,Canada",Oct 2017,The hotel (Bali Nusa Dua)gave us free coupons to get free access to lounge chairs. We arrived around ten and we were only a few other tourists on the beach. Very few vendors
Kamikaze4,"Yarra, Australia",Oct 2017,We have been to Bali over 5times and normally stayed in Seminyak however we wanted to try a new area. Nusa Dua beach is very lovely. Relax beach with no hustle. Not many people try to sell you products. However there were no public toilets there so you have to pay to use a toilet in a shop and they will charge you. 
MegSar,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Very clean beach, much nicer than Legian ect. Water is calm, good for children, however sometimes there is a strong rip. The beach is lovely to take a nice walk. There aren’t any people interrupting you by selling/bartering with you, the odd offer for a massage which is lovely on the hotel lounges. Very relaxing. Short 30min drive from Legian. "
Daria K,22 contributions,Oct 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is very long and not too much people on the beach. Waves are small, so you can go to water and swim, if you decided to surf, you will find a place too - waves are not too big, but still you can learn and try to catch it just a little bit away from a beach side. Recommend! "
Sarah C,23 contributions,Oct 2017,Very lovely beach. The sand is very white and there are a lot of happy tourists. Not many locals trying to sell things which is a nice break from other parts of Bali. 
Vackor78,"Budapest, Hungary",Oct 2017,"Beautiful beach , clean water, hotels ‘ private beaches but offers water sports activities. Not crowded , beautiful shore. "
Tushar P,23 contributions,Oct 2017,It's a clean beach with few people but lots of rock.No shacks and no beer.Not like the vast beaches we generally see due to rocks.Lots of surfers and one can have a beautiful view of sunrise. 
Venture736582,15 contributions,Oct 2017,Nice beach in Bali..  Can't ask more than that..  Water is very very clean and crystalline...  There are a lot of turist but is OK... Childrens enjoy all beautiful day
TuukkaT,"Vaasa, Finland",Oct 2017,"We spend two weeks in Nusa Dua with a family of five. The area is totally made for tourists and therefore it feels really safe, clean and comfortable. Of course it is a lot more pricey than Bali in general but with small children it is worth every penny. You can also relax in peace in the resorts which is nice compared to other areas where the vendors are quite pushy."
mohsen_rio,"Shiraz, Iran",Oct 2017,I think nusa dua beach is beautiful and cleaner than the other.i recommend if you want relax and silent.but if you want activity i recommend kuta beach.
nykbbnyy,"Brooklyn, NY",Oct 2017,Went to the public area of this beach.Found a spot with lots of space with no one around but then we found out why. The water here was filled with garbage. Lots and lots of it and not just small pieces but big pieces of plastic. We moved to a different part where more people were and it was much cleaner but still some garbage in the water and sand. When I walked the beach I saw there were people cleaning in some spots but other laces were pretty filthy. Very unfortunate and I'm sure the bigger hotels try to keep their sections clean.The water was nice and calm for swimming but just too much garbage to recommend anyone visit.
carrosau,"Barwon Heads, Australia",Oct 2017,"A lovely beach, clear and clean and a nice path to walk along, linking hotels. Only a few free standing restaurants but look out for Pirate's Bay a great restaurant where you sit in treehouses and get served lovely cheap food."
Nick A,"Bronx, NY",Oct 2017,"Absolutely a fantastic beach! Very clean! This place is really protected and taken care of by the government, main tourist attraction! The resorts here are all top notch and offer different feel and amenities, male sure and do your home work!The water is gorgeous, so clear!"
rachel z,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Yellow sand (not black like other beaches). and clean, clear beautiful water to swim in . When the tide starts to go down the water is just gorgeous to sit in for hours."
Amrit C,"Auckland, New Zealand",Oct 2017,The Beachfront lines a number of high end resorts. Its clean and secure with no hawkers etc. You can walk all the way down it to Bali Collection..
T S,"Jupiter, FL",Oct 2017,Not really great for swimming. Lots of watersports catering to tour groups at the far end. OK for a walk but must walk through a hotel or business to get to the beach.
a12445,"Whitehead, UK",Oct 2017,"This beach is part of the Melia Bali hotelgood sandy beach water is shallow at high tide at low tide the water is far outpaddle boarding,jet skiing and boat trips can be had along the beach"
Janenebabe,7 contributions,Oct 2017,"Was extremely shocked to find the waters edge filled with rubbish - as we walked along we noticed that the cleanness areas to swim are in front of the top hotels eg: club med who take pride in cleaning the beachfront of their hotel. Nusa Dua beach was lovely and quiet with no annoying sales people approaching you with goods like seminyak beach. The sand itself is coral, so sand shoes are a must. Lovely sheltered temples to relax under along the beach . There are also market stalls of clothes and the prices were cheaper than seminyak or ubud. "
Sara S,"Herzliya, Israel",Oct 2017,"Very dirty - honestly dont understand what the fuss is about, Bali has more beautiful beaches! Try swimming with yoghurt cups, lots of plastic and plastic bags... disguisting. Time for travellers to take more responsibility over the impact we make on the places that we are visiting..."
Traväla711,"Nairobi, Kenya",Jun 2017,"The price of alcoholic drinks and cigarettes on the beach can be negotiated. The boat trip organizers and masseuses on the beach will try every few hours to get you to have a massage. Avoid saying yes if you don’t intend to, because they get offended."
Jaime A,"Montreal, Canada",Nov 2016,"Such a beautiful beach, in such a beautiful country.... Fell in love with Bali from minute one! Would (and will!) return the very first chance I have enough time to travel to the South Pacific. Indonesia, thank you! (Jaime Alcaraz Montreal)"
melindawisetyo,Jakarta,Jul 2017,"Compared to other beach in Bali, Nusa Dua Beach is my favorite. It's clean and blue beach with white sandy beach. Not too crowded, perfect to chill and do sunbathing."
Nitesh Bhopalka,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2017,Nusa Dua beach is full of luxury hotels and almost look like dram destination. Clean beach and very less crowded 
Luka B,"Logatec, Slovenia",Sep 2017,"Ideal for surfing - beginers, there are many surfing schols, nice sand beach, not nice beach after 14.00 because of low tide..."
stumpy1954,"Grays Thurrock, UK",Oct 2017,"As previously submitted, this resort is of a very high standard, and we have already decided that we will be returning in a couple of years"
marybe21,"Ripon, UK",Oct 2017,"Lovely beach, beware that this is mainly because at high tide the waves are broken away from the beach leaving still clear water close to the beach. At low tide this empties leaving little water and seaweed close to the beach. We loved the paddle boarding. "
Grahame N,"Charlestown, Australia",Sep 2017,"Great alternative to the multiple pools available in the resort.The beach activities were fun, jet skis (woo hoo).  We all enjoyed immensely.  Plenty of places to relax with many chairs and day beds.  The beach bar was over used."
LizzyDizzyPerth,Perth,Sep 2017,"You must come here if your in Bali Totally worth the taxi fare from KutaApprox $30-$40 return trip on s bluebird metered Taxi.We loved it so much and recommend everyone to come and see,"
Francois R,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",Oct 2017,Nice smooth sand but sadly there is always litter coming in from the ocean. You can go for nice long walks which was great.
Tadela W,"West Stockholm, NY",Sep 2017,This beach is a local beach very quiet and beautiful. The locals are so sweet the food on the beach is cheap and tasty. The only down side is there was a lot of Europeans that showed up late in the day. 
mechen121,"Taipei, Taiwan",Oct 2017,"The location is inside Nusa Dua. A great place to visit and advised to bring the family along. Beautiful beach to spend the afternoon, while waiting for the waves."
Vedna B,"Durban, South Africa",Oct 2017,"Breathtakingly beautiful! Crystal clear with shades of blue, white sand, spectacular, flat water, you can lay there and float away. Best beach experience yet!"
Mark B,2 contributions,Sep 2017,"This beach fronts home many Nusa dua hotels which make avaliable sun loungers to it's patrons, although this luxuary is not avaliable to the public beach which is the smaller of two bays that make up the Nusa Dua beaches. The sand of these beches is soft although a little harsher under foot neare the water. The sea deapth was relatively shallow even at high tide during our stay at a metre or less,although the public beach side has some deeper areas in it's bay, but both sides may be a little higher at different moon phases. Both beaches have reefs at there fronts edges which makes them shallow in the main, and thus no significant waves to catch you out.  With it's palm fringed front and soft sands it is has the idilic feel a long haul holiday/honeymoon has to make you feel good."
the travelling tradie,"Warners Bay, Australia",Oct 2017,"Crystal clear waters and white sand! Very nice beach. Activities available all down the beach, clean water(no rubbish around) and a bunch of flash resorts to stop in for a drink "
anon888385,"Lithgow, Australia",Sep 2017,"Water on the beach was pristine, blue and clear, looked incredible. Visited other beaches around Bali whilst sight seeing and none of them topped the beach at Nusa Dua. Only down side being a few pieces of rubbish that had washed up or been thrown there, but still a lot less then any other beaches. Beautiful to swim in on a hot day when the pools aren't enough. "
SPH63,"Boundary, UK",Sep 2017,Fabulos beach no shale or sroney beach sand sand sand .very shallow only up to waist high for a great way out only then does it get deeper.not alot of fish about so not great for snorkling gotta get a boat to take you out further for that.cafe is great have your food at the bar we found it got cold by the time it took to get to the beach at the cafe you got good food drinks ciggies some snacks .food was always fresh cooked from what i could see and had .never had bali beli .toilets basic :but unisex as the day goes on they do smell and dont get cleaned regulary.enough.Sunbeds get there early only 100 idr for two all day .prices go up as the beach fills .beach vendours once told no they didnt bother us again .massage highly recommend it yiann also known as numder 5 amazing lady 200idr for full body best money spent all holiday .Taxis get the local blue or blue bird dont get the others your likely to get ripped off the bar will even get you one.
Virginia W,4 contributions,Sep 2017,Beautiful white soft sand with clear warm water.  Safe for swimming.  Lovely gentle breeze all day.  We think this is the best beach in Bali and we have visited and stayed in many different areas of Bali
mark b,"Dana Point, CA",Oct 2017,Just returned from Bali. Beaches and water are perfect.  Areas where beach is not groomed have lots of trash but not in front of the hotels
vamsi111,"Hyderabad, India",Oct 2017,The beach is not so great as the waters are very still and there are hardly any waves. There are many luxurious resorts around and people just cool their heels. Everything here is expensive and the best part we liked is water blow. There are lot of cultural events that take place. Food s great. We can see the far islands nusa lemboghan and penida from here. Bargain to half for the water sports. 
Richa84,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2017,Oh and avoid the sea urchin. Not great for any swimming activity as there are too many reeds the whole way round the pennisula
Anthony J,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is very nice with white sand although with only very small waves. Most of this beach area is very relaxing, with less bogan tourists (that you will find at Kuta beach) and more Europeans. Also, unlike Kuta Beach there's less locals trying to sell you souvenirs and massages, which makes for a more relaxing and peaceful experience. The water here appears much cleaner than Kuta as well. The only down side is that this side of the island gets the sunrise instead of the beautiful sunset that you get on the other side. But, if your goal is just to relax without being bothered then this is the beach for you."
cliffandjo,"Wroughton, UK",Oct 2017,Nusa Dua beach area has many locations.  If you access from the Bali Collection area you can get onto the beach in front of the hotels but it's not great.  Best public access is in the Geger Beach area or walk through the St Regis and park up on the sand by their bar.  Most of the good beach areas are in front of hotels.  Don't be intimidated by the security guys just be cool and make your way where you want to go and use the hotel facilities for refreshment and loos !!  
Franki1213,4 contributions,Sep 2017,"Lovely,clean beach with only small waves,perfect for relaxing without plenty of swimming to do. The only thing it misses is the sunset,which is on the other side of the island."
Marie R,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Nusa Dua beach is a beautiful beach with crystal clear water and white sand. Very good for families.  It is a very quiet and safe place and very relaxing.  I will recommend  to ho thete if you are in Nusa Dua.  There is lots of trees to relax under if you dont want to stay under the sun all day.Very nice view too.Marie
458krishnad,"Warangal, India",Oct 2017,"It was a lovely evening we decided to visit the Nusa Dua beach. The beach front itself has been completely developed, with numerous shopping complexes, beach clubs, Bali Collection (mall) all at the same place. The water is clean and shallow. Not much current so it is safe for young kids."
Richard K,21 contributions,Sep 2017,Beautiful beach spotlessly clean with a path running along it with was a lovely walk with we did not than once 
bleketepluk,3 contributions,Sep 2017,White clean sand.. Not good for sunset. Sunrise view only.. Some part of the beach exclusively for 3 hotels. There's not much of souvenir/gift shop
John White,"Saltash, UK",Sep 2017,Beach is just beautiful & ideally located next to perfect hotel in the laguna luxury collection. Secure & safe with lovely golden sand.
jc26_11,"Langkawi, Malaysia",Sep 2017,One of the cleanest beaches in Bali water wise but the broken bits of coral make it hard to swim. Need water shoes. Subject to high and low tide so swimming is subject to high tide. Very pretty beach.
madeinIndonesia,"Montreal, Canada",Sep 2017,apart from kuta and legian here is more quit. you wont have street seller try to offer you food or massage which sometimes it kind of bothered. 
Giuseppe C,"Bristol, UK",Apr 2017,Nusa Dua is good soft sand large beach in Bali the water is warm and clear but is not calm there are strong currents that pull you across and if you you are not a strong swimmer then it would be a struggle.For so called paradise I expect more.Walking along the costal path toward the Regis and Mula hotels the water is calmer but then it's hindered by shingles and pebbles.It's not the best beach I have been to what really lets it down is the tide will go out in the early afternoon leaving the beach a lot less enjoyable.It's quiet even with the hotels there's not alot of people for the amount of space there is also safe.
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2017,Nusa dua public beach is a beautiful quiet beach in Bali. The sea is beautiful. It's not to far from Seminyak and Kuta area. Here less beach sellers than Kuta.
willski2016,28 contributions,Sep 2017,One of the best beaches i have visited plenty of things to do lot of water sports jet ski/paddle bording/speed boats nice place to relax and just enjoy life you don't seemed to get hassle by people trying to sell you stuff like most other places 5*
mchrst490,Doncaster,Sep 2017,Nice white sand but the tide goes out early so in the afternoon the sea has gone well out. Not the paradise beach I was expecting.
Christopher L,"Bogangar, Australia",Sep 2017,"Awesome place to go for a stroll, plenty of sites and sounds.  I especially like how quiet it is.  Not to many merchants selling stuff."
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,This has to be one of the most beautiful beaches in Bali. It's good to visit with family and for a romantic time away from the all the party beaches. It is home to some good hotel chains and luxury shopping. The water sports here are really good. 
Stephen G,"Limerick, Ireland",Sep 2017,"The beach itself has lovely golden sand. The tide does go out a way and when it is in the water is quite shallow but a nice temperature (September anyway). Great to go in and cool off or for paddle-boarding, which seems quite popular.We never found it too crowded. Very safe for children due to depth and no strong currents (that I was aware of) possibly due to the reef.Worth a  visit"
amos.sd,"Nice, France",Sep 2017,"Just wow... Everyone visiting Bali should go to Nusa Dua seaside. Just try and see, you will be amazed!"
AHViking,"Trogir, Croatia",Sep 2017,"Nice beach but the tide makes the currents strong. Some places it's like being in a rapid river. The resorts have restaurants by the beach front. Public access several places, but the sun beds are reserved for resorts guests. Places to rent equipment for water activities."
C T,"Main Beach, Australia",Sep 2017,We loved this resort hotel. Positioned along the Nusa Dua Beach area and close to other resorts. Beach area is spectacularly clean and without hawkers.
maggietynan,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,"Beautiful beaches - most day beds are controlled by the hotels along the strip.  A great walk along the beachfront - many couples having wedding photos - eg 5 at a time - all during the day.  Hawkers keep their distance and you can have massages on the beach - either organized by the hotels at a price, or much cheaper on the actual beach. Sand is white, ocean perfect and many delightful restaurants to have a bite to eat with squirrels in the trees overhead"
Afterdark1400,"Isfahan, Iran",Sep 2017,"Super beach!The Laguna hotelI liked the relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and hospitality of Bali people."
Wayne W & J,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,"Lovely hotel and staff, had Scoopon voucher which was great stayed in pool access room, very far from everything,shops etc, but perfect if you want peace. Pools awesome and huge, spa in hotel expensive but well worth the price, staff there definitely know how to give a great massage. Very friendly and helpful team. "
Angryangmo,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"Most parts of Nusa Duas long coast line are divided up into parcels, belonging to the multiple hotel resorts, making them their private beaches, however they all have one thing in common, while there are plenty of beautiful and relaxing lounge chairs available, if you want to actually go into the water for a swim, consider going to another beach.There were tons of sharp rocks and pebles making it a painful process to get into the water, and the water itself wasnt really clear / nice, as on other beaches, not to speak of the dream like ones of Thailand."
vipula m,"Northampton, UK",Sep 2017,Beautiful clean beach White sand Lovely place to relax Mist of the beach is exclusive to the hotels but there is some areas where you can useGet hassled by the sellers
btnpete,"Brighton, UK",Sep 2017,"Beautiful beach with plenty of shade. The beach is clean and quiet, there are beach sellers here but if you are not interested no hassle from them. The sea is also clean however there is only certain times that you can swim as the sea goes out a long way. But there are several pools of shallow water where you can submerge to cool off "
Gopi nath,243 contributions,Jul 2017,"Nusa dua beach is a clam beach with not much of waves. This is good for relaxation and water sports or activities.If you want waves, then this beach is not the right place. My son also found a star fish at this beach."
Wilhelm_Polinski,"Kassel, Germany",Sep 2017,One of the best beaches in bali ! We stayed 2 weeks at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and it was amazing!No Sunset here but in the early mornings you can see a beautiful Sunrise !!!
Steve D,"Kersbrook, Australia",Sep 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is a great beach for families. The water is very safe for little kids. If you're coming from another part of Bali make sure you check when it's high tide and plan on arriving 1.5 hours before so you can enjoy the water for the maximum amount of time. The tide goes out a long way. If you have time, hire a bike. There is a track which runs along the beach all the way to Benoa with some great views of the resorts. It is interesting to check out how the rich and famous are spending their Bali time."
PNMG,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,"Small beach , where the sea water is warm but shallow . With low tide , it's like a bathtub , we can't swim . Great for small children ."
skpatel,"Vadodara District, India",Mar 2017,"Very beautiful beach , so many visitors,  you really feel that you are enjoying vacation.  So many well-known hotels and resorts and restaurants . You can enjoy local shopping "
Exploration66293,14 contributions,Sep 2017,Quiet beach with access controlled by neighbouring resorts. No hawkers and a very comfortable environment if visiting solo. Beaches weren't patrolled on the day visited which is why I rated 4 rather than 5. 
BlueTravelMagnet,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2017,The view at the south end of the Nusa Dua Beach is stunning and we enjoyed the same by taking tons of pictures. The water can get quite shallow and thus one may need to walk little bit towards the sea but it is definitely worth it. The colour of the water and sand are something I loved watching. Must visit when in South Bali 
Kevin S,5 contributions,Aug 2017,The beach is pristeen and safe although too shallow to swim. At low tide you get to walk out to the reef that completely protects the bay. There are a few vendors in the beach but they are friendly and not overly pushy.
Theo,"Enfield, UK",Aug 2017,"We stopped here for a few hours early in the morning and the place wowed me. Id been to a few other beaches around bali and they all seemed to underwhelm but this is what i thought when i though Bali beaches.Golden sand, calm clear waters and the surrounding views are gorgeous. picture opportunity after picture opportunity. Maybe because of the time we got there (around 8:30am) but the place was nice and chilled and still was by the time we left and had a much more laid back vibe to the other beaches i had been.Definitely worth a visit"
555steve,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"Great beach always clean and well kept as it mostly adjoins the name branded hotels etc. At low tide walk out and look at the exposed reef, at high tide you can get your fill of water sports like jet sking, paragliding etc etc. For the family a lot better than Kuta as you don't get waves breaking and the rips and sweeps that are dangerous and come with the breaking waves."
Diane A,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Water is turquoise and calm during low tide. The view is spectacular and beach is clean! Just gorgeous 
platinuuum,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Sep 2017,"Great for couples or families ! A piece of paradise, very affordable. We stayed closed to Ayodya hotel beach, and rented beach chairs and towels for 500k each. We did some snorkeling, and though it's not a recommended spot, I saw a huge snapper, tons of blue spine unicorn fishes and the usual tropical crowd ! For water sports, ask for putu ""chinky monkey"" kamput at the Ayodya beach bar. He will give you cheap price and awesome time !!"
Kin P,15 contributions,Aug 2017,"Quite beach located off several brand name hotels. Plenty of space to soak in the sun, build sand castles or take a dip or swim.  Relatively calm waters."
Jane B,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,This beach is nice and clean although there are signs warning of sea urchins at low tide. Plenty of water sports here and a well maintained path that goes from the Bali Collective down past the resorts.
TeignmouthAsh,"Teignmouth, UK",Sep 2017,"The beach is beautiful golden sand, it isnt fine sand though. We loved it. The only downside is that there is a reef just of shore, when the tide goes out you are left with very shallow water out to the reef. To get there and in to swimable water on the other side you need to wade through a forest of sea weed. We didnt see many fish, which was surprising. We did sea a Banded Sea Krait though, a highly poisonous snake which gives a lethal bite!All in all we really enjoyed it, but after seeing the beaches at Seminyak, Ulawatu and Pdang Pdang, we wont be coming back"
iveronikaa,"Oslo, Norway",Aug 2017,"It was a very nice beach, but not very special or diffrent. The water was clean And the sand was light beige. Good place to tan And swim, but deffinetly many tourists here so it is not like a secret hideaway. Would go again."
Tumelo2K,"Gaborone, Botswana",Sep 2017,"If you're into long walks by the beach... this is your place.Beautiful, calm waters with soft sandy beaches. The water is warm and perfect for lazing in.Has a promenade where you can a walk for over 3 miles. The promenade runs through all the top beach resorts with free access so there are plenty spots to stop for a drink and admire the view.Different lagoon spots to watch the waves and enjoy the calming effects of the ocean."
Pao,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"Here is where I've chosen to take the sun. The beach was beautiful, the sand fine and white, there weren't many people specially around 10/11 am and that made it perfect. You can rent a parasol but it is also ok to take a towel or a cloth and extend it on the sand, it is safe and the sea is calm and not too deep, still you can swim and enjoy the sun."
HayleyJMatt,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"On first look, the beach looks lovely. However you really need to experience more of the island and once you have done that you will realise that Nusa Dua beach is really not the beach to be at. We had smelly camels walking up and down the beach when we were here, giving tourists rides. The camels were defiant and definitely didn't want to be walking up and down and up and down the beach all day. It just felt like I could be anywhere in the world and to top it the sand was rubbish. Do not get me wrong - the hotels along this beach are bloody fantastic.But seriously, if you thought this beach was fantastic, you obviously didn't experience enough of the rest of Bali."
Sean B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Aug 2017,Certainly spending time of this beach in high tide is fun but there is an equal experience when it is low tide as you can walk out really quite far to where the waves break.
Jack F,"Los Angeles, CA",Aug 2017,"the sand is the best and the beach is most clean in Bali. Much more quiet than the beach in Seminyak.  Overall, a great relaxing beach with spectacular views"
Luisito de Pineda de mar,19 contributions,Sep 2017,"The best holidayss ever...romántic, amazing people, cultural, relax, funny, drinks, foods, animations.....unforgetable holidayss"
Loredana B,"Bucharest, Romania",Jun 2017,"If you're going to visit Bali, don't choose Nusa Dua as your place to stay. We made that mistake and it is my biggest regret from that holiday. Although we rented a scooter and we managed to escape every day, it was not a good choice. Nusa Dua has a lot of resorts, restaurants and shops, but they are in a specific environment, you can feel that everything in there is under supervision and in a very strict conditions. Plus, everything is much more expensive than the rest of Bali. You will not have a complete balinese experience if you chose to stay there. "
Seyda,"Baden-Württemberg, Germany",Sep 2017,Very loooong beach with 50 shades of blue. Though it is hard to swim due to waves in the afternoon and you should check the low tide time.
Pamela M,"North Haven, Australia",Sep 2017,Very very busy beach you can't swim there as too many busts coming and going. Horse riding on the beach not a beach for relaxing best to stay in beachside resorts
Tom L,"Da Lat, Vietnam",Aug 2017,"Clean clear water, clean beach, gentle walk into the deeper water- no severe drop off, great open ocean view."
Bill,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2017,Tge beach behind the grand aston should be beautiful. Sadly it is full of rubbish inspite of the hard work by two hotel staff. Luckily the pool area was perfect so the beach can be avoided
CMcG,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2017,It was a very pretty beach.  although very shallow.  It was great watching the local fishers using the schools of black tip reef sharks to locate the fish.
Curiosity629520,15 contributions,Aug 2017,"Nothing out of the ordinary, but a good beach. Went there one afternoon and there was a low tide. Cozy beach and seems to be good for surfers. "
jayzee91,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2017,"Well Nusa Dua beach has it all. Sun lounges, some shady trees, lovely clean beach with only a couple of licensed sellers. The ocean is refreshing and clean. You can get food, drinks, beer and ice cream. The fresh coconuts are fabulous, a must try.You just have to be careful not to get sun burnt."
andrewhG2744JS,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"Beaches are totally different in Nusa Dua as compared with Kuta,Legian & Seminyak,which are the popular destinations in Bali.The beaches are fairly clean(a little rubbish on the sand and in water on some areas of the beach),the sand is white and the water is clear."
Angela Elvin,"Telford, UK",Aug 2017,"Our hotel was set on Nusa Dua beach and it is idyllic to look at. Unfortunately as water sports (jet skis, banana boats etc) are common place now the sea is polluted with petrol and oil and you can smell the fumes from the speed boat's when sunbathing. I didn't actually go into the water (no one did) presumably because of the petrol etc floating in the water. The sand is beautiful and it is a real shame that the water has been tarnished due to the popularity of motorised water sports 😞"
944jill,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Aug 2017,Tide is out from 4pm so you can walk right around the bay. Lovely. Lots of beds available but they go quickly in the mornings.
MSethi2905,"Gaborone, Botswana",Sep 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is just heaven. Calm warm ocean, clear water and beaches that are clean and well maintained. There is a 🚲 path and rentals are available at the hotels in Nusa Dua (guests only). The beach is kid friendly and has limited motor sports at the beach which creates a serene atmosphere. No tide so not a surfing beach. Ideal for sunbathing and wading. A better beach compared to Phuket, Penang and Mauritius 🏖. "
stevesudjatmiko,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"This  white sand beach is truly beautiful. I dont usually like to stay in the beach for long but this beach is just very special.The water is clean, the sand is soft, the wind blows calmly. I spent two hours doing nothing and slowly my mind and soul feel the serenity of the sea.Simply a must go beach"
Harsh Kandoi,"Budapest, Hungary",Jun 2017,It's the best because of the sheer touristy feeling of being enveloped around hundreds of 5star properties and good crowd. And thats also why it's the costliest!
Sutan,12 contributions,Sep 2017,"Been exceptional place to regenerate .There are a lot to e.g. Swimming pool, beach lovely service and food  "
Anton M,"Barwon Heads, Australia",Aug 2017,A relaxed setting with great walking paths and good services for beach growers Not heavily over developed which makes for a relaxing and restful visit Cannot fault location  
J.D. Drayton,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"White sand, crystal clear water and beautiful aqua sea! This beach is what you would expect on a tropical island getaway! The water was so warm and lovely to swim in. I didn't want to get out! You must go before the low tide as it's not the greatest when there is no water. An absolute must-see in Bali! "
Anastasia R,74 contributions,Aug 2017,"Ocean allows to bathe there, waves are not so cruel like on other beaches of Bali. Sometimes water brings too much of garbage but local people are very fast to clean up the mess"
Mandm715,"Teignmouth, UK",Mar 2017,"This beach is pretty narrow and the sea is too rough to swim.  However, it does have visiting turtles in the evening and there are lots of pretty shell."
kuns8530,"Vadodara, India",Feb 2017,good for a leisure and/or romantic stroll along the shore. calm sea good for swimming or just laying in the sun sand and water! best experience of beach side.
RydoBurr,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,Having tried a few different beaches in Bali Nusa Dua is the best I have come across so far. Its really clean and if you are willing to walk all the way past the St Regis then it is very quiet and makes for some excellent photos.
deejay90210,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2017,"A very beautiful and lively beach, with some good beach activities. We were lucky to see an ongoing festival, which made our visit even more special. Water was not very deep, so the kids had a lot of fun. Definitely, one of the best beaches Bali has to offer."
1952desiree,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2017,Its just superb the MELIA RESORT SPA  has its swimming pool virtually on its beach such a treat plus the Santeria restsurant borders on the beach as well was delightful for lunch and a great barbecue buffet in the evening with good band and after a disco if you like plus it offers happy hours at its bar 
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,"I went to this beach for a one day trip from Seminyak, I used Uber to reach the beach (paid around 150,000 IDR), and came back to seminyak again with a bike driver (+62 0 819-3305-1669 for 300,000 IDR). Compared to Seminyak beach it is much cleaner with a brown clear sand, area is calm and having different luxurious hotels). 2 coffee bars/restaurants are available of which Fleet Bar caffè. Also you can enjoy massage in the beach for a very low price."
Carl-Thomo,"Aberdeen, UK",Jun 2017,"There are some stunning beaches in Nusa Dua, however many have a big issue with plastic waist being washed up. I thing the hotels should make more effort and so should all the local people, in terms of cleaning up and recycling. "
acsaroj,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2017,a very well maintained and neat and clean beach...was there with my 1 year old son and i could leave him comfortably on the sand..awesome place to take some great and memorable photos...
Максим О,"Central Russia, Russia",Sep 2016,"Very nice and relaxing beach, with white sand and extremely cheap ($5) massage on the beach. Few little bars catered around the beach with a nice refreshing drinks and nice meals."
nilimag2015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"White clean sands, shacks nearby,lovely scenery. Worth spending an evening here.Its also one of the cleanest areas of Bali & has many good hotels in the vicinity"
shreef n,3 contributions,Aug 2017,"In my opinion, the only merit of this beach is it's quietness. If you seek good view, relaxing and having a tan then this is the place to go. On the other hand, if you are a surfer or water sports lover then you will not find theses activities there. Personally, I liked it so so much specially when you compare it with beaches in Legian or Sanur. Legian beach is perfect for surfers while Sanur beach is good for water sports."
Saanchi A,11 contributions,Aug 2017,"This was probably one of the most beautiful beaches I have seen and experienced! And the best part is that it is not too crowded, feels like you have the beach to yourself!"
Pavel V,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"I love Nusa Dua. I visit Bali two times a year and Nusa Dua is our favorite destination. We have here our favorite hotels. Beach is perfect for family trip with small kids. This isnt place for surfing. Small waves, so its friendly to you baby. A lot of watter sports with pleasent staff. "
DaghanS,79 contributions,Aug 2017,The Nusa Dua beach is so beautiful. The water is clear and the whitish sand is really soft on your feet. The resorts surrounding this area have lovely bars and restaurants next to it also. But there is one thing you should really consider before going: the high and low tides! During our stay at the Westin we could not enjoy swimming every day because of the low tide. During this low tide it's fun to walk and talk to the local fisherman. I don't know if there is an app for it but please make sure before heading to it if there isn't a low tide. Otherwise you can't use your snorkel. 
ErmaMalekkidou,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Aug 2017,"Have been staying at a resort in Nusa Fua area and we have been swimming every day.Water was good, not very salty, cold at the beginning but then you get used to it.At the shore the beach had many algae.In the afternoon the water goes in and you can walk where the water was."
Tijana P,34 contributions,Aug 2017,A local told us Nusa Dua is the most beautiful beach in Bali. It is definitely better than most beaches we have seen here but it is not a WOW one. All the resorts all located at Nusa Dua beach so it is quite crowded. The water is full of sea grass and other stuff... All in all it is a lovely long beach.
John S,24 contributions,Aug 2017,"This beach serves several upscale resorts including Regis, Adoydya and under construction Hilton. The beach is very walkable with light colored sand and a fell shells here and there. The surf varies according to tides but is naturally regulated by reef shelf 1/4 mile off shore. Most beach activity occurs close to the resort property lines. A large variety of beach equipment rentals are available along with potpourri of kites, toys and beachside foods. Remember bring your own bottled water and strong sunscreen. The beach is roomy and safe."
Dini A,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Always visit the beach once a month only for relax, having lunch by the seq while watching children enjoy the beach and play sands. No to busy beach very warm and elegant"
RaKs24,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,There is one section of the Nusa Dua Beach where all top hotels are located and this section is like their private beaches . There is another section of Nusa Dua where all the adventure sports take place . All in all a very clean and safe beach . 
EllenOnVacation,California,Aug 2017,"This beach by far is much better than Seminyak beach.The area is surrounded by luxury hotels.  The sand is not as white as Cancun but somewhere between. The water is clear but during high tide, there is debris and some trash washing up.The hotel staff are diligent at cleaning but there is only so much they can do."
Secret_Moments,23 contributions,Aug 2017,"After hearing how wonderful Nusa Dua beach is, we decided to go and check it out for ourselves. We were disappointed. The sand is dirty with tiny pieces of glass and debris. The water is knee high and the beach has no personality. What a bore! Go to Echo Beach, Batu Bolong Beach (both in Canggu) or Padang Padang Beach (in Uluwatu) instead! :D "
fotochap,"London, United Kingdom",Aug 2017,"A great beach for some R&R. The grains of sand are weirdly somewhat spherical, which means you can sink in a fair bit. There's lots of tiny crabs that flit about as you walk along. When the tide is out, there's a huge expanse of shallows to explore. Just don't get caught out when it comes back in!"
Dr Lois F,"Los Angeles, CA",Aug 2017,This is a pristine beach far from the crowds.  Have stayed at the Westin here several times and never disappointed. Highly recommend.  
Therese  T,12 contributions,Aug 2017,"Not much more to say. Many private beaches, which is nice if you belong to one of them which we did, but if we hadn't it might have not have been so nice.Very clean and nice for someone like me who get jittery every time something unknown touches me in the sea."
Shadiahalsolami,"Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2017,"One of the best beaches.It has a white sands ,good to walk barefoot and good for kids to play.Nice view at sunrise and sunset.In some parts there is allots of water sports "
Maksat A,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,"Nusa dua beach is very clean and no strong waves at the coast compare to other areas in Bali, but please bare in mind that generally all the things are more expensive in Nusa Dua area."
andyros2014,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Nov 2016,"The beach is really nice indeed although there were lots of dead weeds in the water during our stay. apart from that the water is crystal clear, the sand is clean and the hotels around offer enough to eat and drink in order to stay happy while relaxing and sunbathing."
Moving Butler,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Just as you would expect from a post card, these beaches are golden and heavily maintained. Be sure to go to a space that you can be in as most places are reserved by the shore side hotels. There are places that allow you to use a sun bed and order off the menu for a fee.  "
roadtrippernineteen,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2017,Great little Lagoon bay. Calm waters with Rocky areas further out. Food available supported by the hotels and the beach is clean. 
CarelRed,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Great beach, heard that it is drily and not that flash but we experienced it as a well maintained beach with the resorts managing the tourist littering well and keeping it in great form.  Sunrise was particularly excellent."
Alicja R,106 contributions,Aug 2017,"Beautiful beach in Bali. Clean beach, well maintained waterline, warm water, lots of fish. I would recommend !!! :-)"
SheilaRed,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"A long, long beach, that changes character and cleanliness as you go. The beach in front of Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and its neighbours is maintained in pristine condition - early in the morning sweepers can be found at work, and throughout the day cleaners move through the area picking up rubbish. The sunrises are an ever-changing canvas, and when the heat sets in, the loungers are well-shaded under the trees.  At low tide, the sea grasses and sand pools are worth wading through, but tread carefully, as sea anemones lurk in the shadows!"
karl,"Seal, UK",Aug 2017,Great beach very clean and great to swim in. Can get anything in the beach to do such as jet sky etc.. you don't get bugged by the local sellers.
Moris,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,The beach is amazing unfortunately is not much clear in some zone. Beach is long and you can rent a latvian beach with few euros! Place to go if you want relax 
Mohamed I,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2017,The sport activities are nice but the beach is not clean and the sport equipments are old. To enjoy the activities you need to bring your own equipments 
Filip S,ghent,Oct 2016,"white sands, clear blue water, the side of Grand Hyatt hotel is more private, less crowded. The other side full of beach bars and a lot of people. The beach can use more maintenance, a lot of trash everywhere"
Taytaylam333,"London, UK",Aug 2017,Staying at the nusa dua beach and spa hotel the beach is beautiful can't fault it. Clean. Beautiful sand no rocks. Ocean is clear and warm. Just a perfect environment. Has plenty of trees if you get too hot and it really is hot on the beach even the wind is hot perfect for those wanting a deep tan! 
Emily G,"Essex, UK",Aug 2017,"This beach was just outside our hotel (Grand Hyatt) - it is beautiful, clean and there are always sun beds free (based on a holiday that took place at the end of July/beginning of August) - if you are looking to take part in water sports however, due to there being a strong wind there was more often than not a red flag to show that the water was not safe to be surfing/playing about in too much as it got quite choppy at times! "
Bergees I,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,Awesome holiday at nusa dua. Loved the entire stay at westin. Beautiful place with awesome people who welcome all with open arms. 
Eric E,66 contributions,Apr 2017,"What can one say about the beach here that hasn'tt already been said, the water here is pristine most of the time, extremely clean and just a great place to catch some sun or go for a dip, easy access and if your staying at one of the resort that border the water it's quiet and peaceful, sand is clean and the kids would love it."
ehughes48,12 contributions,Mar 2017,"Beautiful sand and trash filled water.  There is a serious trash problem in the water in Bali. Bali has every kind of beach. Some are great for surfing, some for watersports, etc. This area has lots of watersports but the water is full of trash."
TravelDiaries_Pulkit,"1,523 contributions",Aug 2017,"This beach is just amazing. White sand, clear water and beautiful landscape - what else do you expect?Located close to a lot of great hotels, the crowd and the facilities provided at this beach is great. Highly recommended!"
Ebony R,21 contributions,Aug 2017,Full of rubbish but still nicer than Kuta. Was fun playing among the rock pools looking at little sea creatures. The scenery is nice if you focus to the distance and not the floating nappy by the waters edge. Surf seemed good 
abhi2001_10,"Hyderabad, India",Jul 2017,Very clean beach in the secluded Nusa Dua area - the hotels here try and keep the beaches as clean as possible - also not as crowded as Kuta or Seminyak
slalexan,"Drummonds, TN",Jul 2017,Simply amazing with awesome scenery and restaurants with food selections that are scrumptious!! I enjoyed the beach with friends and solo!
Susan N,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Aug 2017,"If you like getting smacked around in the waves and letting the current carry you along, then this is the beach for you. We had a ball in the waves, we went in one part of the beach and let the current take us along and then jumped out and did it again."
BenTas36,"Launceston, Australia",Jul 2017,We were surprised at how clean the beach was and it was nice to go and sit on the beach and just relax. 
Anabela V,"Macau, China",Nov 2016,"We stay in a private beach  hotel,  so the beach was only for hotel guests! Clean and well treated:)They also offer yoga classes, cicling to their guests! I'm sure this is one of the best beach you find in Bali,  because in this beach stands the rich and famous hotels there! To visit Bali  beautiful beaches, you have to go book a boat and go an smaller island! There you with have better & cleaner beaches! "
Patrickc69,"Saas-Fee, Switzerland",Aug 2017,"Nice beach.  Sand is white and good. Not much space to swim, very shallow.  Waves look nice but far and no one go there (dangerous?).  Good beaches but far from Caraïbes beaches quality "
ANAND DESAI,"Ahmedabad, India",Jul 2017,Sofitel hotel has its own beach in NUSA DUA Very clean. Beaches and crystal clear water You can enjoy leisure walking during sunset and surise Enjoy relaxing body message in the cool air
Mariana R,2 contributions,Aug 2017,"Perfect for family with kids. The current is mild and water is pleasant so kids happily go into the ocean. Sunrise is gorgeous. And the beach is lit up for the evening. Spectacular. Great for watersports for beginners: paddle board, windsurf, etc. Close to great snorkling and diving sites. Love it! "
bergy2017,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,"White sand, green and blue ocean with a great break. Plenty to see from the hotel frontages to the water sports and temples. "
JBGourmet,"Masai, Malaysia",Jul 2017,"Nice sandy stretch of  beach that was very pleasant to be at. Less crowded and no one trying to see you stuff. We took a long walk from the Novotel private beach to lunch at Nusa Dua Beach Grill,  had a wonderful lunch experience. "
Leah A,64 contributions,Jul 2017,This is one of the nice beaches of Bali. It is very clean and well maintained but expect the flock of tourists. This is within the area of  the huge hotels so many people come and enjoy the view as well as take a dip.
AussieMike,"Acton Park, Australia",Jul 2017,"Lovely beach but as with almost all tropical beaches we have visited, there is loads of plastic in the sand... its the sad state of the world we live in now 😢"
Gzd5,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2017,"Nice beach for sunbathing or walking. Not good for swimming comparing to Mediterranean Sea. But still better than Kuta. On high tide, you may swim with seaweeds."
Corryn60FR,39 contributions,Jul 2017,"Nice beach, clearwater.Nusa Dua is a safe area, with shopping area, restaurants, lots Of activities."
Janine636,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"The Nusa Dua Beach resort area is well maintained with loads of top resorts to choose from.  The beach itself is nice enough, clean and looked after by the various resorts along its shore...the tides are extreme so you have to pick your beach times carefully.  There aren't too many locals harrassing you to buy their products which is good."
Mouhannad_ElMidani,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Dec 2016,This is a clean sandy beach with calm waves. We had direct access by staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. Locals sell handmade stuff. Can spend a relaxing time under the palms. 
carole h,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2017,Great for watching sunrise (Seminyak for sunsets!)Particularly good for water sports enthusiasts - plenty of choice for all ages.My preference is floating around in the warm shallow water in the secure areas away from the jetskis etc.Lovely area for parents with little kids!And no hassles from vendors on this beach.
saurabh2591,"Noida, India",Jul 2017,beautiful.. serene.. amazing place for a long romantic walks.. take a dip in sea.. sit on the side with your favorite beer.. just awesome
sanjeevcc,Kolkata,Jun 2017,Nice beach with clear sand. No activities at the beach however the beach is very good and clean. Can enjoy
Ahmed_abdoul-al,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"Good place for spend time with friends or family. Beautiful sea, very clean beach...  Right place to relax and enjoy . Good service as well. "
Dkkeeling,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2017,I think a good second to Jimbaran beach on Bali islandPleasant and nice and they say good for Surfers
SylviaHill,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,"Beautiful beaches, can walk along the whole length of beach. All the five star hotels are along here and all of them have beautiful beach bars also on the beach. We've been visiting a different one each day. All good. "
Sharonandrea,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,Spectacular beach and I am not a beach person usually. The water was warm and the beach constantly cleaned. Vendors are limited by the resorts so you are not constantly hassed
j0hanna76,"Tranemo, Sweden",Feb 2017,once you enter the water it is full of plastic and there are no life guards for the children. very unfriendly staff on the ground
Amul M,"Uppermill, UK",May 2017,"Stayed in The Laguna Beach Luxury Collection a stunning beach front hotel, the beach is maintained daily with tranquil waters, the tide does come in and out and a marked difference between high tide and low tide, lovely beach."
Abby,"Cologne, Germany",Jul 2017,"This beach is your typical paradise when you think of Bali. Miles of pristine white sands and clear blue water with few rocks. The only thing that really bothered us were the sheer volume of chinese tourists taking photos on the beach. Not just a few nice photos but literally spending hours posing on the beach with sarongs blowing in the wind, etc. It got annoying because they told us to move several times so we weren't in the background. Best not to make eye contact either or you'll be stuck taking all the photos for them - this happened to us twice. "
aston ashley W,97 contributions,Jul 2017,"Really clear water, much cleaner than Kuta but kind of boring if you're not doing water sports. Also most of the beach is reserved for hotel guests and a small section is public, where vendors start charging Rp. 250,000.00 for a deck chair and you can maybe bargain down to 100,000.00 so felt abit alienated. Better in the morning, low tide in July so the water started moving back slowly as the afternoon went on, pretty cool to see though! There were some food stalls there with seating space, nothing impressive, a 500ml water cost Rp.10,000.00 hotel prices so pack a nice picnic basket."
Marilyn,23 contributions,Jul 2017,A beautiful beach with beautiful views. Good pavement to walk on. Many places along the way for coffee or drinks 
Joseph C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2017,The stretch of beach is wonderful windy clear beach and water. Just nice for couple family. Best if stay in resort. They have people clean the beach all the time.
happytrailsnoco,"Wellington, CO",Mar 2017,Many of the beaches in the Kuta area are less then pristine in paticularly in off season are not well maintained with litter on the beaches and debris such as plastic waste washed ashore Also uncommon in much of this area are green open spaces. Nusa Dua offers a large green park area adjoining the beach. The beach is well maintained and clean.It costs nothing to get in even though it is part of a larger resort.The landscape around the beach is striking-check out the cactus. The tidepools at sunset/low tide are worth exploring.
Domdanny,Sydney,Jul 2017,Nusa Dua beach is beautiful especially near St Regis hotel and Mulia resort . You can enter in between the hotels there is a road that leads you directly to the beach  . You must visit 
Patty W,"Ogden, UT",Jul 2017,The beach is very clean.  The sand is quite coarse and can get quite hot.  Plenty of shade.  There are lots of vendors walking around which gets a little annoying.  Waiters are walking around for drink service.
Monami_Bangalore,"Bengaluru, India",Jun 2017,Very quiet and beautiful. Most beaches in bali are crowded but this beach was not so. Not recommended for swimming.
christiano_10,"Tczew, Poland",Jul 2017,"blue water, beautiful views, not many people - this place is much better compared with the busy, crowded and noisy Kuta beach."
Annie G,"Chatswood, Australia",Jul 2017,"We spent some of our time at the beach adjacent to our resort, and it was very nice. There were some plants floating in the water sometimes, and the jetskis and windsurfers were often very close to swimmers, which can be dangerous.The sand was clean. The massages on the beach are terrible - unprofessional and expensive. You're better off walking into town and having one at the spas there..."
s0nty,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Surprisingly the beach now is more crowded with tourist wearing full cloth :/ And unfortunately all the beach spot there already owned by the hotels around :( Although its not as quiet as couple year before, but the beach still a nice spot and kids friendly. "
Stephanie S,10 contributions,Jul 2017,"It was nice to walk around there and to get  traditional light meal, very cheap. The beach was clean and the water very calm  but not good for swimming because the water was a little bit muddy. Not much we can do here."
Kyriakos_Hasapis,"Nicosia, Cyprus",Jul 2017,"The view of the ocean is breathtaking!! I could lay on the beach and see the ocean for hours, ordering a fruit punch and enjoy the view.. Swimming into the ocean is not recommended if you are not a experienced swimmer. The sea is not the cleanest I have ever seen, but the sand without rocks is nice to walk on. Overall this is not the best sea for swimming, but the view is exceptional."
Joao B,"Lisbon, Portugal",Jul 2017,"This beach is sunny and quiet, very pleasant to walk or stay in the sun. It is not excellent to swim because there are rocks in the bottom of the sea, visible at low tide. However, there are some areas where we can bathe without any problem"
waterstarz,3 contributions,Jul 2017,Nice sandy beach but small. Low tide at times so not possible to go into the sea. Not suitable for very young children as the water isnt very calm
Kate R,29 contributions,Jul 2017,Beautiful and clean full of resorts. We weren't allowed to be under the trees. Bring your own shade or spend time in the public part and hire a beach chair.  Take a trip down to waterblow
tim r,"Chester, UK",Jul 2017,We stayed at Nusa Due Resort and this area is very nice and relaxed. As you move north the beach becomes very busy with motorised water sports (a bit like a motorway). Beach itself is good though. Sea is tidal so you need to plan your day to swim inside the nominated area.
Kim W,9 contributions,Jul 2017,We spent the afternoon here and thought it was stunning. The beach was far more picturesque than that of Kuta/Seminyak/Jimbaran. We walked out to the blow hole and then sunbathed on the stretch of beach between the two peninsulas. Definitely worth a visit! 
Bratcatcher,"Portsmouth, UK",Jul 2017,"Wouldn't spend much time on this beach, lots of litter and coastal erosion has taken away the pathway. Very run down and not pretty at all. "
Bernadette C,24 contributions,Apr 2017,A must see and enjoyed many lovely walks here but was expecting the waters to look like pics.Water for swimming can be quite rough in some spots.Lovely to lay on lounge in sun and enjoy a quite setting in bali for a week prior going home.
SonS1975,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,One of the cleaner beaches in the tourist areas and close to the blow hole. Protected beach by reef/ rocks. Kids loved it
Kerry M,"Minchinhampton, UK",Jul 2017,"Lovely white sandy beech but watch the waves and currents, they can take you unawares. One minute my husband paddling ankle deep in water the next he was in the water minus his sunglasses!There is a lifeguard but take care, particularly if you have children or you're not a strong swimmer."
Alekchansuang,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2017,"The best beach from Bali. Top location, the sea is quiet on that side and you choose between water sport or relaxing on sunbeds. We recommend this part of Bali if you are looking tranquility and serenity."
archibalda,"Acapulco, Mexico",May 2017,"You should never ask Mexicans or Australians about beaches as they get an unpleasant sneer and say ""we have better at home"" and I'm sorry to say this was what happened with our predominantly Mexican/Australian group. Having said that, the water was warm and we had fun with paddleboards. "
Neville2907,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Had a great holiday in Bali, living or based in Nusa Dua and then exploring Bali from there. This area is quitter than the Kuta area. The hotel was 5 minutes from the beach."
ShellyGott,"Salt Lake City, UT",Jul 2017,"The beaches on Nusa Dua were what you dreamed beaches would be in Bali Beautiful sand, clean, and you could walk pretty far into the ocean. We snorkeled and had a great time.  They offer parasailing, paddle boarding, etc. or it was calm and beautiful to just lay on the beach with a good drink and a great  bookI would highly recommend a resort on Nusa Dua BeachWe stayed at the Westin Hotel Perfect location to enjoy the beach."
Jeanie J,27 contributions,Jul 2017,"Clean; great staff, drinks and food! Just perfect! I would return at any opportunity! There was great entertainment for couples, families, any one looking for a fabulous vacation location. "
dibanov,Indonesia,Jul 2017,nice mixed experience of green gardens and beach... and this beach is peaceful although many tourists there ( we went on high season in July 2017)... 
LovingLife2013_13,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,Nice clean beach close to Nusa Dua resorts. There can be a small wave but generally it is pretty flat close to shore.
James N,6 contributions,Jul 2017,"Water was very far out due to the low tide for most of the day which was frustrating, because the beach is beautiful when there's enough water to swim. Water sports offered along the beach are quite pricy and can be quite annoying. The beach itself has potential, but the low tide during the day took away the option of a nice swim in the sun which was disappointing."
Psalm2,India,May 2017,A white sand beach. Water sports available too. Bali Collection with numerous eating places is just a walking distance away.
Advourner,"New York City, NY",Aug 2016,"This is a great beach, but should be cleaned more regularly.  I loved lounging on it at the SR Hotel."
Lyn C,7 contributions,Jun 2017,Stayed in Nusa dua for a week and we loved it. We stayed at nusa dua beach hotel and resort and we had our own private beach. It clean and the water was clear. Not as busy as kuta or seminyak but we were there the first week of June so not yet peak season. I highly recommend this beach if you're looking for more clean & relaxing beach
Heath E,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"beach is groomed daily, first time I have seen sea snake babies on sand heading to the water (before sunrise very rare) , very safe beach swam with children in the water minimal risk of stingers / or sharks although a strong current and undertow, very safe and very interesting, ."
Maximilian K,61 contributions,Jul 2017,"As travellers that have been to Seminyak, Canggu, Ubug, Gili's and Lombok before we were really disappointed by Nusa Dua (very artificial, overpriced, not authentic, no good restaurants!). We felt like we ended up in Disney Land. Everything is full of Chinese tourists, we even got asked by them if they can take pictures of us (we are Europeans). Place of mass tourism, crowded beaches, you'll get the Nusa Dua bonus on everything you buy (scooters, petrol, hotels, food). If all this doesn't matter to you and you want to ride a jetski, go parasailing or whatever do watersport in a place which does not represent Bali at all, then spend 100$ more and go to a hotel in the gated area!"
Dav Anmed,"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico",Jul 2017,Yes ppl dont freak out! Gili & lombok are amazing but are far from denpasar.Clean miles of sand! A lot of resorts to rent an umbrella if you consume a meal or drinks (300k on july2017)...To me the best beach! No trash and less crowded than kuta and seminyak.
Bolynn B,Gold Coast,Jul 2017,"Nusa Dua is very upmarket boasting some amazing hotel/resorts, however, you could be anywhere in the world as it is quite clinical compared to the rest of Bali. Accomodation is pricey but still more affordable than the same sort of hotels would be in Australia. Food, beverages and entertainment are pretty much Aussie prices. I paid $15 AUD for an entree size plate of tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese in our hotel, which was expensive even by Aussie standards. A SUP will cost you $15 per hour, a bicycle $5 per hour. In Sanur, we paid $3 per day for a bicycle at The Puri Santrian which is also a 5 star hotel. I have to say I far prefer Sanur in terms of value for money and the beaches are just as nice. "
Nathan L,3 contributions,Aug 2016,"Stayed here around 2015 and thought it was really good. The facilities are good but not as good as the grand Hyatt. The fitness centre was really good, the pool was nice and all the resturants were really good. The breakfast was amazing and was much better than the grand Hyatt. The lobby was incredible and is one of the best I have seen. However when I stayed there wifi wasn't free in the rooms so I had to go to the pool or lobby to get internet access. I'm not sure if this has changed or not. The rooms were very nice and they weren't noisy at all compared to the grand Hyatt which is much older. Overall I think it's a nice place to stay, it's not as close to the connection centre compared to the grand Hyatt but it is a great hotel and I will possibly go back again."
Mandy673,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2017,"Great place to visit, would definitely recommend, however living on the Sunshine Coast our beaches are by far better & CLEANER."
NancyTravels13,34 contributions,Aug 2016,"I'm glad to stay here after a very long and exhausting travel. Everything was quiet, peaceful and great to recover and lounge around the beautiful beaches "
gingerdip,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Sand not compact, many sharp stones, shells and rubbish washed ashore. Lots of seaweed, not recommended for children or anyone to swim out. Waves r big. View was good because the beach is private. Many wedding photographers coming in to take pics and shushed away by security. Wedding photo groups can add up to 4 or 5 every day! They smoke, litter and spit on the private beach. Hope ayodya security can effective chase them away and employ staff to clean beaches. Ironically the staff pick fallen leaves but not rubbish."
Romario1257,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"This year we decided not to have daily trips to temples as already done this last times and just enjoy the beach.We choose Nusa Dua and was perfect choice for my taste and needs:- beach was clean- you can see morning sunrise - water not to deep- water sports available- a lot of beachfront 5 stars hotels- a running path just along the beach for few kilometers - a close area with restaurants with live music and shopping opportunities - beach bars at each hotel- well maintained beach by each hotel with sun beds and shadow opportunities as after 11 AM the sun can be strong- every day a cool breeze from ocean all day long made the weather just perfectDefinitely if you look for sun, beach, sea and less crowd this is the place.I will definitely be back.Enjoy!"
amrita_77,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",May 2017,"Beautiful white sand beach..most of the luxury resorts are near to this beach.Many restaurants,souvenir shops are nearby.Beach is ideal for surfing."
Clive M,"Lyndoch, Australia",Aug 2016,"Stayed at The Grand Aston Nusa Dua Great Resort, the beaches along that strip are amazing and the beach activities so many things to do . but I think my favorite part was as soon as you step back into the resort Serenity."
Feride I,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2017,"It's a nice beach, although you have to walk for about 5-10 mins to reach the nicer area of the beach (the sea is very shallow in one part, so you have to walk pass by it). After you pass the grand Hyatt hotel area you arrive to that part. The sunbeds costs50k per 1, the beach is quite clean, not perfectly clean though. The water is clean, only some seaweed is on the seashore, but it's not bothering you. The beach is quite without any sellers. The sea is sandy with no stones, which is also nice, coz you can play and walk safely. "
BOBBOTOFFO15,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2017,We loved relaxing on the loungers at the beach. The calming noise of the sea and the clear water with nice sand. The beach is surrounded by some of the best hotels in Nusa Dua. The sellers don't really hassle you much and are friendly. The tide has an impact late afternoon which impacts the sea that is the only real disappointment. 
DavidDundonald,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2017,"Golden sands, shallow shelving and crystal clear water. This is a lovely beach. Delighted to have spent a week here. "
Samantha L,2 contributions,Jul 2017,"The sunset was good and very romantic, the sand was so warm and make me relax. I recommended this place for beach lover."
Ruchi260182,"Thane, India",Jun 2017,The Nusa Dua Beach is a clean beach...Sea weeds at times may be an issue..But still a very serene sea and you a clean beach where sea can be enjoyed. 
Helen Q,"Greenock, UK",Jun 2017,"Some very expensive , a lot have the same menu  The beach was a  disappointment with lots of rubbish in the water ... nothing like the pictures you see in brochures 😠"
Erudite_journey,"South Pasadena, CA",Jun 2017,"We visited here while touring the Sheraton Hotel. Lovely beach. Beautiful water. Clean, warm, fresh."
ShumsKamran,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Beautiful beach with clear blue waters and white clean sand! Loved spending lazy evening here, watching the sunset and admiring nature at its best!"
Victoria G,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2017,The beach at nusa dua is lovely but due to the peak season the water is filled with trash everywhere.Found loads of plastic wrappers and tissues and wasnt pleased about the cleaniness. 
Paulus C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Beach nusa dua is beautiful and clean. Safe for families with small children. Hardly any garbage, the sea water is blue clean and the waves are not too big."
Lesley M,"Aldershot, UK",Jun 2017,"Not to many hassles from people selling stuff, great place to relax good food 🥘 around.Very clean."
juliekBucks,chesham,Jun 2017,"Beautiful beach, the best. So clean, white sand, like paradise. Have to go through security, bu we were lucky enough to by taxi, and they let us in. Not all the beach sellers to bother you either."
Sunil N,"Gurgaon, India",Apr 2017,Visited Nusa Dua for 3 nights... it was a great experience. If you are looking for a beach location in Bali.. this is a good option.Most good hotels have their private beach and resturants inside the property. You wouldn't feel the need to go out of your property.Ocean view rooms will be a good option. We chose grand mirage.. good option. There are other expensive options too.. depending on your pocket.Overall a good place with a good beach.
Sarah G,24 contributions,Dec 2016,From the hotel Nusa dua beach hotel it was 10 min walk and we walked through all the different resorts
Fiofaith,Jakarta,Jun 2017,One of the best beach in Bali and not consume to public so my family can play and relax around the beach.
Tjokrosaputro,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"If there is the ultimate getaway in Indonesia where we can escape from everything else with a 5 start treatment, not to worry about quality of life, Nusa Dua is the place. This is the place Indonesia can be proud of and the resort area other countries envy.Miles of white sand beach, gentle even for beginners and children, plenty of water activities and tens of 5 star hotel resorts from the best names in the hospitality industry.A very secured place for all, the resort offer areas for those who are active from the break of dawn till after midnight as well as those who needs place to relax. "
Mei Y,"Nullagine, Australia",Jun 2017,"Nusa Dua is dominated by 5 star resort with shady trees and beach chairs while the Jombaran Beach is reserved only for sunset seafood dining. Bali is so well endowed with kilometres and kilometres of sandy beaches that every part of the island can be carved out for different activities! With the hot sun during the day, hotels at Nusa Dua has done a great job in softening it up with investing in rows and rows of trees and shades, beach chairs, seaside activities... What a place to relax! There is a small portion open to the public. Beach chairs can be rented along the public section"
Voyage_De_Plaisir,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jun 2017,I think one of the best beaches of Bali . Water sports awesome .... very clean and silver sand . Just loved it . 
VINEET S,6 contributions,Jun 2017,"Hi I have just returned from BALI  and our experience was amazing , culture , beaches , people at Bali are very close to Indian hearts we stayed at KUTA , NUSA DUA , And GILI TRAWANGAN And enjoyed the lot unlike to india beached are very clean and have all amenities only minus point is Bali beaches are filled with much stones  and many visitors specially children find it difficult to stay in local authority must put some information regarding the caution it will help tourist to pre plan to take beach footwear with them"
vtipping,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,Depending where you are the sea is out a bit but clean beach. The stray dogs are friendly so we fed them they eat very slowly which I didn't expect. You don't get all the bothering there either but can get cheap massage 
Angela R,5 contributions,Jun 2017,I came to Nusa Dua and suddenly i saw a banner with words 'Nusa Dua Lights Festival'.  It was such an amazing experience. I really enjoy the fest. So many food stans and others. Its really fun! 
Bill B,"Santa Monica, CA",Jun 2017,Great beach. Not too crowded .  A lot of good choices to eat and drink. Light show is not great but everyone goes to see it .  Best bike path in the island 
Rajesh K,"Pune, India",Jun 2017,"We visited Bali, Indinesia. We were staying at Mercure Nusa Dua hotel. The beach is very close and hotel arranges transport. We visited the evening and it was very pleasant. We spent more time to observe Indonesian marriage there.It was about to sunset, enjoyed a lot!  "
Traveldreams365,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,"Nusa Dua beaches are lined with beautiful 5 * Hotels, lovely gardens and restaurants. One can walk along the beachfront for kilometres enjoying the scenery and hotel facilities along the way.There are also little Balanize beach stalls along the way where one can purchase beachwear, sunglasses, hats and more.Plenty of water sports centres too, which is great entertainment if one sits observing all the activities.If you are lucky to be out first thing in the morning you may be lucky to view the magestic volcanic mountains before the clouds veil them for the day.A lovely part of BALI, with not too many people like the beaches in Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. Well worth a visit."
redd7734,"Irving, TX",Jun 2017,"We came out on a hot day. Our hotel had chairs and towels. The sand gave us a workout walking up and down, back and forth. The water felt nice, wasnt too windy outside. Seemed like alot of trash was left behind on the beach and in the water. Not to mention alot of rocks. We took nice pictures though..."
Sam M,"Antrim, UK",May 2017, Every day without fail my wife and I had a swim or a dip in the sea ( depending on the tide ) and afterwards a walk along the beach to dry off. It is cleared every day by the different hotels beach cleaners who keep it in tip top order. The only problem with this is that they also rake up the sea shells which we quite enjoy collecting. It is also a very interesting walk when the tide is out as you cane see lots of small fish in the shallows and if you are lucky a lot of starfish. Well worth the walk.
Pauly_Posh,"London, UK",Jun 2017,Lovely soft sand and clear waters great for everyone to enjoy. There are several people walking along the beach selling things which can be annoying as the beach is public and not hotel owned
Beverley65,"London, UK",May 2017,One of the nicest beaches in Bali. All the hotels have staff cleaning the beach daily. You can watch many weddings taking place.
Jasmine H,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"We just relaxed in the sea water and chatted as wave after wave just moved us in the water and when we were tired, we would just simply walk up to the deck chairs and order a bite to eat"
Bhoomika P,4 contributions,Jun 2017,Its one of the cleanest and quietest beach on the strip. has a nice photo and dinner point that you can pre book
Tim C,"London, UK",Jun 2017,Great sand beautiful warm water..Will be back. The reef 150 mtrs out means that the water is calm no matter how windy
JoelDSouza,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2017,This is one of the best beach in Bali. The water is clear Blue. I visited early morning during sunrise. The beach is very clean and calm. I also saw few people enjoying surfing at this beach.
ndmadan,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,We were overjoyed when we visited the Nusa Dua Beach specifically looked after by our Resort- Grand Bali. It was a lovely place to enjoy the calm waves & lush green water of the sea with plenty of Palm trees & a lovely snack point at the the place which was very refreshing 
rebelo1981,"Algarve, Portugal",May 2017,"If you walk north, you will find a peninsula, which has a massive statue in the middle and has some grass fields. Very nice area."
Joe S,39 contributions,Jun 2017,Nusa Dua as a beach is clean and some hotels even have staff clearing the seaweed. Relaxing walk for several kilometres stroll. Nice way to relax if you don't like cooking yourself sunbaking.
DCumberlidge,"Manchester, UK",Jun 2017,Definitely the best and cleanest beach we saw on the island. More peaceful than the Kuta side so perfect for relaxing 
Eric_Bachtiar,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"Fantastic beach, clean water, and hot weather if you like tanning. We were at the Novotel side of the beach. They provide some water sport activities too. Lots of tourist taning their skin there."
justine555,"Palmerston North, New Zealand",Jun 2017,"It's a nice beach. We walked along the length of it but spent most time down the southern end (near the Mulia hotel) where our hotel had a small deck chair area to relax. This location was not overly manicured like up the other end with the huge resorts. I really liked that it had more of a local feel. A couple of dogs lying on the sand (but no problem - in fact added nicely to the local ambience), sunbathers, boat renters, local bar and cafe (rougher style). You can also walk further south along the path in front of the Mulia hotel to a restaurant.  Lovely gold sand, which is coarse but still nice. The beach does go down quite rapidly into the water (southern end) so just take care to watch your kids when they go paddling/swimming. Also the sand in the water is very loose so your feet go down into it quite a lot! Makes it harder to walk but also weirdly fun!"
Varnika B,"Noida, India",Jul 2016,If you are looking for a pristine sandy blue crytal clear water beaches this is a place you should visit they have #luxury resorts and most of them are good and place to visit.
Kelli M,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"Most of the large hotel chains are situated on Nusa Dua beach. Because of this it means majority of the sand area is filled with hotel reserved lounge chairs. If you are not staying at that hotel you may have to pay a price to use a beach chair. This also makes it difficult to exercise around (running etc).Very clean water and the best area to do water sports in all of Bali. Prices vary depending on day, time and your success with bartering."
Luke H,9 contributions,Jun 2017,"Nice beach for relaxing and the Nusa Dua area is great to take it easy, totally contrasted with the business to the north in Kuta and Ubud. However, the beach isn't anything spectacular: unfortunately there's often rubbish such as plastic in the water, not to a huge degree but enough. Pretty good waves and very safe for swimming as the breakers are far out. It's very shallow for a long distance. For the best beaches nearby you need to take the boat out to Lembongan, there the coral is alive and thriving and the water is perfect."
Kenny C,4 contributions,Jun 2017,"Very nice beach, beautiful sand and clear water. Not at all crowded just before the busy season. We went in early June"
Nandini G,India,Dec 2016,Dnt miss if you love any form of water sports its simply great. there are various operators which offer different options. Drinking water and toilets are available near the beach. Beach is clean and great for hanging out.
Sue519,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"A nice strip of beach that runs along from the Ayodya past the Grand Hyatt Bali.Generally very clean compared to Tanjong Benoa etc.Many activities but do not go if you are looking for water sports.That,s what makes this area more relaxing and there are many hotel bars and food places along this strip.Try the Ayodya beach area for the lowest price beers and cocktails plus tasty food.You can even lounge there in the bean bags if you want to."
SteveJacksonnufc,"Gateshead, UK",May 2017,"The beach is some size and we were on differing portions of it at different times and on some occasions didn't time it right, so it gets a little getting used to. Too late in the afternoon then the tide was out and it really was no good. But when it was in the sand was beautiful ( a little too much rubbish and seaweed to be excellent ) and the waters soothing and warm. We spend a lot of time at the beach as opposed to the pool when away and Nusa Dua beach was good but not spectacular. I had expected better from Bali."
Bob K,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,"Relatively clean and not to choppy, said to be the best in the area. Used  it nearly every day, very nice and just outside our resort the inaya putri."
William Khoo,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"We walked around the beach and the shopping area. Just be careful that when you take a taxi back, the price is fixed and can be pricey. Hence you may want to get your pickup from wherever you come from.  "
GrahamAgnew,"Magheralin, UK",Jun 2017,"Beach is ok, the sand is coarse and the area advised to stay within is very shallow, there is a lot of weeds and chorale at 4 feet depth and I would not venture into this area having seen the sea life in the rock pools when the tide was out.Was ok but not what we expected "
rvpmumbai,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,Most of the beach is accessible through the 5 Star hotels that line it. There is public access though at one end. the waters are shallow till very far out into the sea. Water is clean and clear. Not much crowd as compared to the other Bali Beaches. Nice for a quiet time. Not much activity at this beach - we loved the place generally.
Jooellee,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,Well guarded area with securities everywhere. Perfect spot for picnics. There's bike rental if you wish to cycle around the area. There's also beach chairs along the beach for you to relax and graciously enjoy your coconut drinks (but it cost way way expensive compared to else where. 40 000RP for a coconut.)
dalilali,"London, UK",Jun 2017,"We spent 10 days in Nusa Dua. The beach is clean, clear blue water, waves calm enough for my 8 and 11 year old to swim and play around. The water is nice and warm and we often saw little fishes swimming nearby. We felt very safe any time of day or night. Another benefit is that you are able to watch Waterblow from here. Wouldn't stay in any other beach in Bali."
emmarmbrown,"Essex, UK",Jun 2017,"A simply breathtaking view, a tranquil paradise perfect for relaxing all day by the ocean or mooching along in the moonlight. "
Tien C,3 contributions,Jun 2017,We had spent 1 week at Nusa Dua beach and we really enjoyed that. Very wonderful beach. Good for honeymoon 
Godsgloriousworld,"London, UK",Jun 2017,Stayed at one of the Nusa Dua hotels which line the beach. Beach was clean and best of all for me I didn't see a single dog during any of the time I spent at the beach. Mostly tourists and towards one end of the beach was an area where a lot of locals bathed. There were a couple of vendors who approached but weren't at all insistent. Not the clearest water I've ever seen and some small stones etc. in parts but I was just grateful for a beach in Asia where I could totally relax and not worry about dogs.
onmove2013,"Caloundra, Australia",May 2017,We found Nusa Dua much better than Legian or Seminyak beach. By my 7.30 walk the beach had been cleaned. Even the leaves had been swept up around the beach entrance. 
Wim0705,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Since I was staying in seminyak and spent time in kuta I was looking for a bit nicer beach. Ended up in Nusa Dua, was not disappointed at all. Quiet, clean, relax. Great experience. Easy and cheap to get there using GrabCar. "
Tarmo M,1 contribution,Mar 2017,"Had a nice holiday in Nusa dua.Good place.The beach is wonderful,but the food and drinks is very expensive inside the hotels area.Had the good and cheapTaxi driver.If someone wants to drive with his taxi.Name is Putu Santika phone number +6281236906663"

Manjari G,"Watford, England, United Kingdom",May 2017,The waterblow in nusa dua beach was just awasome. Lovely place with natures beauty. Nusa dua beach is also beautiful and clean beach and much better than Kuta.
roglek,3 contributions,Jun 2017,"Very beautiful beach in south of bali, we spent all day to enjoy this beach. Sand is white and very clean beach."
gbmoneymatters,"Delta, Canada",Feb 2017,Very nice and clean.  Big difference from Kuta Beach.   Well maintained and secure.   Worth the drive if you're looking to spend  day on the beach.   
motyer,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2017,"It was very shallow so we could walk a bit, swim a bit and spend time relaxing.  be careful about the coral rocks though, some parts of the beach are filled with them and they can hurt to walk on."
PanamanianWanderlust,"Panama City, Panama",Jun 2017,"Nusa Dua is a great choice if you don't want the hussle of a noisy beach where everyone is partying, instead you want classy restaurants, good bars, walk and chill near the beach, beautiful balinese settings by the beach (gazebo bale bengong), peaceful bike rides, nice views... "
Mel L,31 contributions,Jun 2017,"Lots of water sports available, the water is a very pretty color but there is no surf close to sure. There are waves out the back though. At night it is deserted. "
Sajam13,Austrlua,May 2017,The path has washed away and not been repaired along 'The Bay' so to walk along the beach for Bebek Bengal to Pirates Bay you are negotiating broken concrete path & rubble. The area is not clean or looked after. From Melia onwards there is path and the beach is lovely. The hotels & beach cleaners make every effort to keep it clean. 
backpacks_kokil,"Guwahati, India",May 2017,"Simply put, there are lots of beaches in Bali. Nusa Dua is a little busy if one is looking for a getaway. But clean. Lots of water sport activities, grand beach resorts and spas. I would put this above Kuta which is overcrowded."
Alexey S,15 contributions,May 2017,"The beach looks like a dump area each morning, full of plastic crap and water weeds. The hotel staff keeps working through out the whole day to clean the beach. They do their job on sand but are not able to clean water that remains full of plastic crap and other stuff like women's pads and so on. It is not pleasant to swim in such water at all. The local authorities need to do something with it. The most part of people who come to spend their vacations on sea side have to stay in the pool area instead."
Mona C,240 contributions,Jun 2016,"We stayed at the hotel around Nusa Dua beach which is has the most of amenities that you'd expect from Java distric hotel.If you can stay in here based on promotional cost rate it would be good. As we know that Nusa Dua is prestigious location for upscale hotels.The beach are better than Kuta because almost everyday I saw many staff working very well to clean up the trash.But anyway, we had a romantic dinner at the beach and its so lovely!!"
lesley s,"Sturry, UK",May 2017,Can't fault it! Clean and plenty of comfortable sun beds - security excellent and staff so helpful and friendly I would recommend this 100%
Hasan S,3 contributions,May 2017,"Beach is very good and beautiful but tide is dangerous. Before 3 pm you may have a beatiful view, you can enjoy the sun and the ocean. "
Ginnie T,"Chandigarh, India",Jun 2016,Quite clear waters . The sand is powdery and light brown . Nusa dua beach is not very very crowded but has visitors from 5 star beach resorts engaging in water activities mainly . 
Climb14ers,"Colorado Springs, CO",May 2017,Nusa Due Beach is lined with resorts.  Most of them allow public access to the beach.  The beach has nice fine sand.  There are some pretty large tides so swimming is limited.  When the tides are low there is not enough water to swim and when the tide is in there is considerable surf and current.  There are plenty of places to eat along the beach.
JJMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2017,It is one of the cleanest public beaches in Bali. There are some hotels also in Nusa Dua with private beaches. 
Nigel S,"Canterbury, UK",May 2017,"Beach is lovely, however spoilt by us humans with the usual plastic bottles and crap washed up, can never understand why people leave their crap on the beach, just shows their class I suppose, the guys clean the beach daily and is really nice."
969ivorm,"Belgium, WI",May 2017,"This beach used to be a gem, loved the water here. Great food Great Place. becomes very hot in the afternoon"
MonikaModakDass,"Aurangabad, India",Oct 2016,"Clean, unspoilt..one could have a candlelit dinner organised there! The beach itself is not large. It would be better to go in the evenings and enjoy a beautiful sunset."
larrif,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2017,"beach was  very pleasant and if yu r fan of water sports, then this is the place for all the water sport activity."
Jean-Pierre M,"Montreal, Canada",May 2017,"WATER BLOW: nice but, depending on weather conditions, you might have to be patient if you want to get ""the"" shot so plan to stay there a little while if pictures/video is important to you.PRIVATE BEACH (FREE!): my wife and I stumbled upon a nice, deserted and almost virgin beach there. On the way to the Water Blow, get off the path a little before the Water Blow when you see a little temple between the trees to your right. There you will find a little private beach. We stayed there 2 hours and had the whole place to ourselves."
Ujwala S,1 contribution,May 2017,"It was a superb experience with Mr.Gel gel. He took all the efforts from pick up , all the sports and dropping. What ever he advises is apt. He told us to pay for only 4 sports and if we have still energy left then we can plan as he advised we were completely drained after 4 sports. My 4 year son had a great time and it is Very safe. He takes all precautions to ensure everything is alright. Jet water pack is the best it is not so easy his instructors were very good. Very patient they were and they were very happy when I finally succeeded...perfect teachers"
Hasheena,1 contribution,May 2017,Awesome white Sands beach and pvt villas around. You can chill at a resort beach bar with long chairs and umbrellas...happy hour available most of the day
Adam T,"Petersham, Australia",May 2017,"Large tides can play havoc with swimming plans. I would say don't rely on great beach swimming, get it when you can but have a great pool as plan B. "
Mohammad S,29 contributions,Oct 2016,"During our visit to Bali Indonesia to attend our Global event we stayed in Westin Resort hotel near Nusa Dua Beach. By far this was my best experience  of staying in great and luxurious hotel and also enjoying the real life of Nusa Dua Beach. It was very attractive, sunny, golden sand based beach with tropical Trees all round the place. It was just a marvelous place to be there. I strongly recommend it to all peoples visiting Bali."
Emma N,13 contributions,May 2017,Easy to relax in the sun and sand. Low stress and plenty of options for things to do for the whole family. Love the small stalls every now and then on the beach walk. Great for everyone. 
Yang C,320 contributions,May 2017,"Nice beach, the sand very soft and niceGreat scenery but the sad we can not sit on there, some place are restricted for public the public only cAn goes through in without place to rest on"
Jillian W,29 contributions,Apr 2017,"We liked the beach in Nusa Dua because it was quiet and you weren't constantly bombarded with folks trying to sell you something. The surf can be a bit rough at times, but it's a great beach for surfing and hoodie boarding. "
Meagan C,"Greenvale, Australia",Apr 2017,The beach is connected to the hotel and was great  - had a wonderful massage on the beach  - and drinks from the on beach bar
HoneyandPaul,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2017,"Great beach, in fact pristine as a result of the individual efforts of the various Five Star Hotels on the beachfront. "
Sher Leen,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2017,"My husband and I been to a few beaches in Bali and we think Nusa Dua is the best beach among the others. The sand is white, soft and most importantly clean. The water is clean and clear and fishes can be seen swimming through the patches of seagrasses just slightly off the beach. Nusa Dua is a public beach but most part of the beach are already taken up by the hotels. You can still find a few spots with shades but make sure you bring your own mat or scarf to lay on the beach. The beach seatings owned by the hotels can be used as long as you order some drink or food from them. We ordered a drink for IDR105k, which is pretty expensive, and used their beach chairs for a few hours."
Phil W,"Bournemouth, UK",May 2017,"We stayed at the Grand Bali Hotel and this section of beach for the hotel was at the far end. The water was full of plastic, wood and other junk and made a dip in the sea unpleasant. There were workers raking the beach but then digging holes to bury the same rubbish! I personally wouldn't go back to Nusa Dua"
1LifeTravel,12 contributions,May 2017,"My fiancé and I got here in the afternoon on May 23, 2017 from Ayana Resort on the Western side of Bali. The tide was low and the water was set back about 300 yards from the shore. To really enjoy the ocean at Nusa Dua you have to be at the beach in the morning until around 1-2pm before the ocean recedes. The Pics never show that. "
Asbestos3939,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",May 2017,"This beach is not what you think it is , it's just a place for locals to make money of the tourist 300% more than anywhere else in Bali and clear waters is not the really what you see well it was not in May when we went "
Nikita Gupta,"Chandigarh, India",May 2017,nusa dua beach is a very clean beach and offers spectacular views.It is a clam and serene beach.Its very beautiful beach and there is a park next to the beach which is also very nice and is great for yoga or meditation
Sanjeev G,"Hyderabad, India",May 2017,Nusa dua beach is beautiful and heaven for surfers had a amazing time at this beach as it is not crowded and good for sunrise 🌅 would suggest must visit once as it's near to the Bali collection mall 
Gyorgy Sipos,"Exeter, UK",May 2017,We did hope to find a nice beach in Bali well another disappointing beach with rubbish and pollution 
Rob G,"Ellesmere Port, UK",May 2017,"We love this beach, it is safe, sandy and has a lovely look to it. It is accessible from most of the resort hotels. Most hotels have put buoys in the water to mark the safe for swimming limit.There are a few hawkers selling wares and water sports, however they are not pushy and if you gently tell them 'no thanks' they tend to leave you alone."
Kath H,"Albany Creek, Australia",May 2017,Beautiful white sandy beach and perfectly clear water. The downside is a very strong undertow which takes away the relaxation.
Greg C,"Bournemouth, UK",May 2017,"This is a wonderful beach, very clean, great for photos and swimming, stayed here in Laguna hotel and it was fantastic, so pleased with our choice."
AjaySheth,"Bengaluru, India",May 2017,"The waters are just amazing.. You can surf, swim, dive at your will... Superb place to be.. Many water sports are available at Tanjim Benoa beach... you can hire one of them.."
Explorer19,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,"The beach in front of The Grand Bali, probably the cleanest of the lot.It was quiet and peaceful. Free entrance but sundowner chairs were available at two hundred thousands for three hours. Else, you will need to order something at their restaurant if you prefer to sit in the shade of the trees. Also, don't forget to visit the 'Water blow' nearby."
Lenka G,Indonesia,May 2017,"Nice restaurants are nearby.  The beach is clean, with beautiful azure and deep blue colour of the ocean."
faith t,2 contributions,May 2017,"Beautiful location and relaxing spot. The beach is clean, with food and drinks nearby. Plenty of swimming area too."
Chidawgo,"Chicago, IL",May 2017,"The beach would be beautiful if not for the sad consequences of human behavior. Most of the resorts pick up the trash every morning, but some of the areas have piles of it along the shoreline. I was sad to see children playing in garbage in one of the public beach areas. Even along our resort area that was well maintained, you couldn't escape the occasional garbage washing ashore or floating alongside you in the water. It's really too bad this has happened, but if you've been to Bali, you know trash isn't just a Nusa Dua issue. "
TravellingTomas,"Ballito, South Africa",Jun 2016,"Soft white sand, crystal clear turquoise water, this beach is lined with exciting destinations and places to quench that sun dried thirst, the swimming is very safe and the water is heavenly. "
William,"Beirut, Lebanon",Apr 2017,"Did not like Nusa Dua. the beach is dirty and full of solicitors for activities. We tried jet skiing, it was a horrible experience it stopped twice, one in the middle of the ocean. we also did a donut ride which also was horrible. Just no"
Miamosaics,"Brighton le Sands, Australia",May 2017,I wanted a relaxing getaway and I got it.  Nusa Dua is peaceful and a quieter destination for Bali.   It is high security location.
Cherry L,Bunbury,Apr 2017,"I would definitely not recommend this beach for families with children, in particular young children especially in the mornings. The beach itself was nice and clean but the undertow is very strong and although I am a strong swimmer I was swept off my feet. I am told the afternoon is a lot calmer, however I cannot confirm this."
Estee,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2017,Beach is very dirty & renting of chairs is overpriced. Got offered RP300k for 1 chair by the beach. LOL
Carol B,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Mar 2017,We had many great day over our 10 day stay water was clear and the beach was constantly being cleaned Marriott supplied sand toys and towels and lounges and we could charge food and drinks to our room and it was exclusive for the guest of the Marriott couldn't have asked for better the walk along the beach is lovely with some breathtaking resorts as well as scenery 
579sharon,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2017,"The beach is beautiful! Being the main beach for Club Med, Grand Whizz Hotel, Nikki Beach Bali and more, there's plenty of activity! definitely worth a visit!!"
mark t,"Swansea, UK",May 2017,Beach is cleaned daily of any sea weed and rubbish. Sand is vey soft but also a little course. Only two things to note: first us and is very very soft and when walking in it you can sink a couple of hours inches which makes it hard walking but good exercise. Second when tide goes out which is a long way cannot swim in sea so need a hotel with good pool.
rajarshis2013,33 contributions,May 2017,"This may not be the best beach in mainland Bali as beaches in gilli trawangan and lembogan are better,but in Bali mainland this is the best u can get.It's absolutely hawker free, kids can run around freely and one can have a relaxing tan any time of the day.The best thing about this beach is the fact that u can leave it valuable without worrying about it.In front of Inaya putri and grand hotel you will get a flat bed portion where swimming is easy and fun.The water swells a bit during afternoon so early morning and evening after 4 is the perfect time to take a dip."
Natalie K,"Toronto, Canada",May 2017,Fine beaches and gorgeous clear blue water. I would highly recommend this destination anyone planning a honeymoon.
Rafik A,51 contributions,May 2017,the beach has dazzling view but when we got in the water we found many tree leaves. also it has sellers everywhere which is really annoying
Sara Goldstein,"New London, CT",May 2017,"I stayed at a resort close to Nusa Dua but I didn't spend too much time at the beach there. It was a little crowded with tourists (not terrible but trying to have a peaceful beach visit with screaming children and loud tour groups around was difficult.) The beach was a little dirty and the water was not as clear as I would have hoped. However, if you do some exploring you can find some good, less touristy beaches. Overall it was a decent beach but I have seen better. "
Kenneth,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2017,The beach is not clean as it is unless it's the private beach. Pandawa beach is much better if you planning to visit the public beach.
M P,"Hamburg, Germany",May 2017,"Nice beach - very calm & relaxing! Beautiful resorts & pure nature! If you do not want to have entertainment & want just relax, come to Nusa Dua beach! "
Brownprincess L,110 contributions,Apr 2017,"On photographs this beach looks like it is white and powdery like the ones found in Cuba, Mexico and Dominican but sadly we were disappointed to find a darker grainier sand and definitely needed sea shoes as my youngest son trod on an urchin on first day of our holiday and had to have several black small spines removed with tweezers.Looks so different when the tide goes out."
SadyaHossain_Sinthi,Bangladesh,Dec 2016,"Hands down the best beach of bali. The sand is powdery white and the ocean very blue. If I ever go back, will stay there for sure!"
Dragos B,13 contributions,Apr 2017,"Very beautiful beach, but with high waves at high tide. Great for surf beginers. You should find along great hotels, restaurants, bars or beach clubs with meals and beverages"
Hannah P,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",May 2017,"It is a lovely beach but unfortunately lots of rubbish coming in from the ocean and it is not a calm ocean, not great for swimming. "
Kiwiontour_50,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",May 2017,"If you are looking for a pristine beach with white sand and deep blue water, look no further.  I went on an afternoon that was hot and humid but the beach was bearable because of the sea breeze. Surf was rolling in but the red flags were out so swimming was not encouraged but I was told this is not always the case. There are several international hotels along the beach so drinks and ice cream are never far away. When I was there the beach was not crowded, though it wasn't peak season. "
MykeAlpha,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2017,"Don't get it wrong, I love Bali and I love Balinese stuff however this doesn't apply on this place. Overpriced water sports, polluted sea for scuba divers and unfortunately almost no fish for snorkelling."
Voyage104484,46 contributions,Apr 2017,"The public beach section at Nusa Dua is one of the best spots in Bali. Good beach, lovely ocean water, all the beach options, even though some are charging rates comparable to all the nearby large resorts. The local beach co-op has great food at cheap prices, and one of the best locations in Bali. "
Jane G,2 contributions,May 2017,Wonderful visit. Nusa Dua Lagoon Luxury Resort is as good as ever. We really enjoyed the spa. Mersi and Nia and Wiwik are hugely talented. Thank you so much 
patrick_kowalczyk,london,May 2017,most popular beach mainly for 5 stars resort so you are not much able to rent sun bed chairs around. good for swimming and long walks 
Abang Lexa,"Jembrana, Indonesia",May 2017,"I'm just walking around near my hotel, so i just want look beach, And woww !!, It's so beautiful place ever And ever 🙌"
Guru-Grul,"Zagreb, Croatia",Jan 2017,Nice beach with couple resorts for families. Close to surf point and surf rent equipment. Very hot sea around 30 degrees in january.
Priyal P,"Miami Beach, FL",May 2017,"Compared to Kuta and Seminyak, this beach is quieter and more secluded so its perfect for relaxing and catching a tan.The lagoon is a lovely area to swim and if you want to catch waves, you can go further in. Did not do any activities at this beach but overall its a beautiful clean beach!"
mimi918,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"One of the famous beach at Bali , the beach was clean and the wave are not so strong. It's a good place for kid play at the beach."
Amish J,5 contributions,May 2017,Visited Nusa Dua Beach great place with very very clean water and very good for water sports all are good and all bargain and give u good deal for water sports Thanks Amish 
rosievil,"Yeovil, UK",May 2017,"It's not white sand , I would say it is a golden sand . It's a very nice quite sandy beach not crowded . I recommend this beach to those who love to be relaxed. "
ishe2014,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,"Perfect to getaway from the crowd and have the beach your own. It is clean,You could see a beautiful sunrise. "
linda menzies,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2017,Went to courtyard Marriotts beach bar you get free shuttle there every 30 minutes nice lounges with towels waiter service for drinks and food 
Argya N,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"We went there during the New Year holiday and it was really full of people. Most of them are domestic tourist, and what they did was similar with what people did in Kuta few years ago: picnics, bring the whole family, and spend some times on the beach. Probably empty on off-peak season. The sand was albeit coarse."
SunnytheTraveller,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2017,"They keep this beach clean and free of litter. It is very shallow far out with minimal surf, so little kids can enjoy their time out there. The sand here is really neat, and looks like little pellets. The hawkers are minimal here compared to other beaches."
nikkibrown14,"London, UK",May 2017,"Visited the Melia Bali in April as a solo traveller. The hotel, staff, manicured grounds, ambience and food in all the restaurants was indeed very good  and in some cases exceptional. A large hotel... perhaps a little dated but this does not detract from the experience. Very clean and welcoming.The beach is lovely albeit not on the scale of the beaches to recent visits to Mauritius and Sri Lanka. Tended to be hounded by beach vendors.I had a swim up premium lagoon room which on hindsight would not book again as could not use most of the time in April as the evening rains waterlogged the sun beds so could not use!The restaurants are superb and I can not fault any of them frombreakfast to a la carte evening meals. The standard of cuisine is indeed of the highest quality.Bali is a beautiful island and her islanders are indeed proud to show her off... however I found it very touristy and a little congested in places in particular Denpasar where traffic jams are commonplace.Enjoyed my visit but will not be rushing back anytime soon."
Michelle H,6 contributions,May 2017," Amazing place, a must if in Nusa Dua, his is a great place if you don't want to spend stupid money on hotel meals but still want the service and the quality of food we made the mistake of eating in the hotel for 3 days and it cost a fortune but here we have eaten well and gone back to our rooms drunk as skunks on minimal cost , I'm not an alcoholic but I enjoy my holidays and thanks Mr Bobs for helping ."
Uncle_Vin,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,not the white sand type and quite coarse actually so you need to wear something walking on the beach. not in  tourist season so the beach is empty! my private beach!  Feel quite safe here even though i am alone at night. 
lisat65104,"Geraldton, Australia",Apr 2017,Stayed at hotel along beach strip. Water temp cooler than pool. Salty but had outdoor shower afterwards. You sink into sand at waters edge so have to be careful.
Craig S,3 contributions,May 2017,Great beach. Especially at low tide because the reef protects a huge lagoon. Warm clear water. Friendly locals.
Amanda G,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,the sand was clean but the surf wasn't but what do you expect when everyone dumbs rubbish on the ground!! the private beach had a big beautiful tree to get some shade was relaxing to watch people had they pass & read!! 
WorldofJoy,"Derby, UK",Mar 2017,"Lovely Coleman  sloping beach that takes you into warm crystal clear waters, the beach itself is sparsely populated."
DaveBennett49,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,"We normally swim in the hotel section of the back close to The Blow. When the tide is up, its a nice place. At low tide, we sit in the shade, read and enjoy a beverage. Less than the Kuta level of harassment from junk sellers but still annoying. "
alengirl905,"Miami, FL",Apr 2017,We enjoyed our time here and the beach.  My children could not get enough of it!  I loved gathering beautiful shells on the shore.
AlexJH83,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Clean, plenty of places to drink and eat, very good late afternoon when the breeze comes in and sunsets"
Sue W,"Sheffield, UK",Apr 2017,Clean beach with lovely warm sea. Sun beds available and also waiter service from local bars. Recommend a walk to blow hole.
Trishpearce,"Staffordshire, UK",May 2017,The beach shelves quite steeply in areas and the waves can be strong in certain areas along the beach I would not recommend it for small children.  It took me off my feet and I found it difficult to get up and I'm used to jumping through big waves of Cornwall.  The sand is shaile in places and large areas have sharp pieces of coral.  I would recommend rubber shoes also there is a lot of litter in the sea!!! Also lots of seaweed and the water in some areas is oily due to the boats and jet skis. We stayed at the melia and the sun loungers are on top of each other but you can move them to get your own bit of space also be prepared for a long walk out to the sea because it does go out quite far but this is late afternoon.  On a good note the water is warm
Mel D,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"It's beautiful and inviting, but be careful of rips and currents! Also found a needle in the sand 😞"
BUGI_70,"Florence, Italy",Apr 2017,"Course not the most beautiful beach in Bali but,  especially for swimmers or if you travel with kiddos,  it's a good one. If you enetr the Nusa Dua hotels complex,  no way to get to the beach so,  right outside,  on the left side,  park at the public parking for  2k IDR.Swimming is possible only with the high tide,  so before 3.00 pm.  No sunbeds to rent, no restaurants nor bars. No good for surfers. Quite crystal clear water and white sand. "
aquafinatraveller,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,"difficult to walk on the sand but the view was great, easy to swim during calm sea, the area is great for relaxing  "
Dr Javed R,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2017,"Interested in serenity and in a clean beach? This is the place to spent time. Several world class hotels are located on the shore, and you can enjoy various water sports."
NessyJ87,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,"Nusa Dua beach has always been amazing, but in recent years I've found the beach to be over crowded with lounge chairs, you have people on top of you, which is also contributing to the trash being left / in the water, everyday I pulled out a minimum of 15 pieces of garbage. When I first came to Nusa Dua beach, you had room to move / breathe, I could move my chair into the sun / shade as I wished, enjoyed a beach massage at a reasonable price and a cold cocktail while enjoying the serenity, now you're on top of the people next to you, the massage prices have increased to $50 AUD (for a beach massage!!) which of course you can still bargain down to $10 AUD or less, the price of the lounge chairs has also increased and the noise levels from the over crowding kills the chilled out beach vibe feels.My most recent visits were in December 2016, January 2017 & again March 2017.The private beach at the other end of Nusa Dua's Mulia Resort however is beautiful & similar to what the old Nusa Dua beach was like, pristine and relaxing. "
freddieqq,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,"Not too crowded at this time of the year.  Perhaps this may be a low season possibility due to very  hot, humid and dry weather.  No too many beach paddlers.Beautify beach with fine sand but with interspersed shells on the sand. Further into the water are beds of seaweeds or sea plants which give an ""eerie"" feeling to some.Must say the water is clear and able to see the sea bed."
Thouwaiba,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2017,"Nice place to do water activities as parasailing (cost you 55 dollars ), jet ski , or you can go to turtle 🐢 island . "
Janja1983,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Apr 2017,It's a nice beach. You can swim or surf. A lot of waves. It can a little bit dirty but they clean the trash that ocean brings. The beach is located on the area with a 5 star hotels. You can go to the waterblow and take pics there.
Harry L,"Terrigal, Australia",Apr 2017,Be prepared to chase the tides or arrange your swim at high tide. Beach was clean enough for a busy Bali resort and not too commercial. 
Mercy B,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",Apr 2017,"Th at leastere is no doubt that this beach is beautiful. However, the waves are often too strong for people to swim safely. Hotels along the beach post flags, red more often than not, warning people not to swim. This was the case in April"
Olivia C,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,"Very beautiful beach to explore.  You can go to the beach near Bali Collective to hire a long bed or just chill on the beach, it's a little busier up this end with the restaurants etc or go to the other end of Nusa Dua out of the upmarket Nusa Dua resort area and find a spot on the beach for just you. "
raymond1814,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"This is a beautiful stretch of beach. Beautiful white sand and cleaned everyday of debris that gets washed up during the night. A thing to keep in mind is to be aware of the tides. As at high tide it is great for swimming, but at low tide you have to walk a long way to get into water you able to swim in. Good for surfing as well."
Ken M,17 contributions,Feb 2017,Lovely long beach. Blue water. Great sunrise. Great for a stroll with your partner. Was low season when we went so wasnt packed like I have read in other reviews..and there was not many activities to do when we were around... saw some camel rides happening..but not to our interest. Good to swim when it is high tide. Would recomend for honeymooners.. just remember it is a resort area..one after the other with private beaches
jessk811,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,Stayed at the Westin Loved staying there but no water sports best to go next door to Laguna Nice to walk the path after a meal and nice that can go to any hotel for a meal whenever you like Beach could be cleaner. 
Kttreadinglightly,197 contributions,Apr 2017,"A beautiful spot in Bali to soak up the sun on the sand. Ver child friendly beach, as the reef is far out which breaks the large waves, thus the surfers are quiet a fair way out from the beach. Hawkers are regulated by the resorts and offer local wares and water sports. Bargaining is a must, prices are quoted in USD, and ensure you get detailed information on where and how the activity is being conducted. My experience in parasailing, was that a water taxi took me to a beach a few resorts up, to wait for a JetSki to take me to another small boat outside the reef, then the small boat took me to the larger bust that I parasailed from. All this without anything on me but my swimming costume & GoPro..... so yes it felt pretty uncomfortable not knowing what I was in for. A path along the waterfront links the resorts, about a 2 km stretch"
chipj72,"Meredith, NH",Apr 2017,The area of the beach we visited was private to our hotel. It was well taken care of and had plenty of room for whatever activities you wanted at the beach. 
Pradatta,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Apr 2017,This place is very relaxing. The view is awesome and me and my wife had a wonderful time there. This beach also has adjacent golf courses like park. The panoramic view is mind boggling. There is a Waterblow but we did not see that. This place two beach on the both side of the walk way and they different and has two different kind of charms.
Julija P,"Bristol, England, United Kingdom",Apr 2017,It's a lovely beach and I would definitely visit it in BaliIt's not Caribbean beach but close enough The thing is that the current was strong and it makes it difficult to swim and it gets deep after a you steps you make into the seaIt's a lovely beach to go for a walkDefinitely enjoyable place to see :)
Ange E,182 contributions,Apr 2017,"This beach is seriously amazing, the color of the water, the cleanliness. It was never too busy - we visited every single day of our holiday. Nothing compares to being in that water! Just wow! "
lsylviano,"Bandung, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"The little wave made my toddler loves the ocean instead of scaring him away like those in Kuta Beach. Sand was white, a little rough to walk barefoot for newbies but very quickly getting used to it."
Ashley K,"Kelowna, Canada",Apr 2017,Nice beach. Lots of resorts along the way to stop for lunch or beverages. A little higher priced than other restaurants off the beach. 
YogiAndTheBee,Sweden,Apr 2017,"The Yogi:After a nice scooter ride from Uluwatu to nus dua we found the best beach we saw in Bali. Maybe because its quite clean and no annoying people bothering you. Could recommend you to go here if you just want a beach where you can swim in the ocean and that feels safe and clean. The Bee:After seeing a couple of beaches in Bali i was very disappointed but this is actually the only one that was clean, didn't smell and was not crowded. They had life guards and public showers. We took a scooter so we parked really close to the beach. There are trees so you can get shadow if you don't want to be in the strong sun. I didnt eat/drink/rent sun beds so cant say anything about that."
Michael_Teoh,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"It's are nice and clean beach with stunning view, great place where to swim and have fun..like an heaven and enjoy our day there.."
pommie1,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,Great sandy beach which is very clean as there are people raking up the sea grass.Many of the Nusa Dua hotels back onto this beach so there are plenty of place to grab a drink and eat.Good for swimming and water sports it was not rough when we're there.
Lee B,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"Sadly there was a level of plastic in the water which was annoying. However people came every day to clean, so they are making an effort to improve. "
Maya K,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Apr 2017,Nusa Dua is it's own private gated beach club community. We came through Kayumanis and the beach was absolutely beautiful. It was quiet and relaxing. Safe for tourists.
Abdelmajid A,15 contributions,Jun 2016,"It's a great place with definitely stunning view, great place where to swim and have fun, i enjoyed spending my day over here .. "
December1959,"Isle of Wight, UK",Mar 2017,"Great location within gated secure area with many other lovely hotels.  Beautiful reception and public areas.  Many good restaurants and bars. Reasonable value food but beech restaurants are better, cheap and cheerful.  Rooms good but a bit dated now.  A/C not cold enough.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Good family hotel."
ramchabi,"Chennai (Madras), India",Apr 2017,Based on the tides this is 3 beaches combined into 1.  Low tide and the beach traces back. Medium and water upto your knees and high tide then you ready to surf. Kids and adults galore love it. 
Chris D,"Bay of Plenty Region, New Zealand",Apr 2017,we were staying at grand hyatt so outside our door step . nice and cleaned every day  quite private for our area 
Riaz Karim,"Coonoor, India",May 2016,"nice beach. calm and quiet. very good for relaxing, taking a book and have a nap at the beach side. The beach activities also are very thrilling. but this is as not vibrant as the Kuta having less crowd"
WestLondonDiner,"London, UK",Apr 2017,Recommend this beach. But it's a funny beach with high tide and low tide. Sea is very clear. One side of the beach needs work on and the other side is nice. Some annoying people selling stuff. The beach is calm and relaxing and we loved it. 
marchcarrasco,"Mexico City, Mexico",Apr 2017,"Nice spot  rest and spend time with family or couple, away from the crowded spots in Bali Nice to swim, take a bike, walk, paddle in the ocean, or simply get a tan and relax "
gabby b,"Ramallah, Palestinian Territories",Apr 2017,"The beach at this hotel is great- clear clean water, with the added bonus of bean bags under shade and food and drink brought to you. Heaven if you ask me! "
Feby H,53 contributions,Apr 2017,"Well it's perfect for families beach vacation. Quiet wave, turquoise blue water, white sands. It's really easy to go there. Surrounded by luxurious resorts and become one of luxurious area in bali. I think it's not suitable for surfing. It's really good for swimming, cause nusa dua beach is more like big blue pool. You can walk around to water blow that located in peninsula island. Really nice place to chill "
rebel_diamond56,"Hereford, UK",Apr 2017,"Perfect beach for spending a relaxing day. Plenty of shade under the trees, soft, clean sand and friendly squirrels. Were staying at Grand Hyatt who manage this part of the beach. Drinks and snacks can be ordered. There is also beach volleyball available. The sea was quite strong and some people were surfing. It was much nicer than sitting by the rather busy pool."
mladenvassilev,"Plovdiv Province, Bulgaria",Apr 2017,the wide beach with golden sand... it is nice in the morning with big waves and in the afternoon  without water because of the tide////  
AidaBlatPalacios,Singapore,Apr 2017,This is the cleanest and more current-free beach in Bali. Fantastic. The best part is between the Hyatt and St Regis. 
yousuff,21 contributions,Apr 2017,This beach was right behind the hotel we stayed. I felt it was one of the nicer beaches. This location is perfect to view sunrise. We got up about 6am to catch the sunrise.  Perfect.
David M,"London, UK",Apr 2017,This is a beautiful long beach with great views of ocean and distant mountains. The beach is kept clean by the hotels and the water is an amazing colour and a great temperature 
glear,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"One of the best beaches in Bali, particularly if you get there at high tide and you are staying at one of the hotels that rent a small area of the beach for their guests."
Robert L,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Apr 2017,We stayed at Melia Nusa Dua and they are taking care of there part of the beach as well as they can. In Asia there is always problem with plastic floating every where and it also ends up at Nusa Dua beach. 
ChrisMediwaka,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"It is a beautiful beach with crystal clear water. it does have low tides and high tides. during low tides, you can go for a walk in the sea and see some amazing sea creatures like starfish and mud crabs. be careful when swimming as there were warning signs for jellyfish and sea urchins. Beautiful beach to walk. lot of sport activities available to do as well."
RRoedel,"Florianopolis, SC",Mar 2017,"A very good option of beach to surf or just chill out. It is well maintained and cleaned, with good food/drink options. Definitely is a ""must see"" in Bali."
Ece B,5 contributions,Apr 2017,"We came here with high expectations, having seen many beautiful fotos of Bali beaches. Unfortunately, the beach and the sea was full of waste; plastic bags, old shoes, chips packs, bottles, even a syringe... it is sad to see how we ruin beauty.. Also, the water is not clear but this is still ok as it is sandy and the waves cause the sand to blur the waters.. the tide is nice to watch.. the rent for beach banks under the shadow is around 15 USD for 3 hrs.. you can find drinks and snacks at many small food stalls along the beach. Worth a trip, but manage your expectations. "
Peter_ACT_OK,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,"This beach was just what we were looking for.  Quiet, clear blue waters and clean sand.  The Beach Club called Agendaz was also great."
stripedblood,"Huddersfield, UK",Mar 2017,The beach is beautiful with fantastic views and hotels and restaurants and bars leading onto it. Security is subtle and beach sellers are not pushy and managed well. They also sell beautiful goods. The sea is clear and warm like a bath. Just gorgeous 
Ealingdave,"London, UK",Apr 2017,You have to get here at high tide or you won't be able to swim. Lots of rubbish on the beach and in the sea. You can hire paddle boards and paddle around the lagoon when the tide is up. You have to pay for beds unless you are staying in one the hotels. Some shade under the trees. 
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2017,So nice to find a clean unpollutted  beach that offers  Otho Stillwater and out the back a reef with some of the best surfing. There are boats on hand to take surfers to the reef if they don't feel like a long paddle.  Beach is full of sand and there are places that hire out deck chairs and umbrellas. 
gradedmeeting,"Falkirk, UK",Apr 2017,Beautiful beach and water at exactly the right temperature. Only thing to be aware of are:1. At high tide the water gets deep very quickly2. At low tide soft sand is exposed which can sometimes make it a little tricky getting out of the water 
Sanchita S,India,May 2016,A beautiful clean beach with blue water lashing every now and then.  Thete are a host of water sports activity to choose from. 
Jagdish J,"Chennai (Madras), India",Apr 2017,"White sands, beautiful view of the ocean, snorkelling. Simply breathtaking and amazing. We had a good time."
Faye P,19 contributions,Apr 2017,Very relaxing Great for watersports- jet ski- banana boats- flying fish - boat hire You can barter the companies to a great price too! 
Steve A,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Blue water and great surf..All you could want from a beach.So much better than Kuta or legian and very clean water..
DrTravel 007,191 contributions,Mar 2017,"Staying at one of the 5 star hotels in Nus Dua gives you direct access to this place. Relaxing, walking, swimming etc are all great here. Hotels are very expensive here but the beach is priceless. You could also eat at any of the hotels restaurants and enjoy the sunset."
Duncan M,"Auckland, New Zealand",Apr 2017,Clean and tidy - sandy beach which is safe to be with kids. Our children 9 and 11 enjoyed swimming around and having a snorkel - there were lots of fish to see.
joaojpalma,"Cascais, Portugal",Apr 2017,"Nice views, clean sand, water shallow and warm. No waves, impossible to drown.Very good place to relax and enjoy life"
agustinjuan,Chile,Apr 2017,The beach and the water was gorgeous. Lot of people are visiting here. Good location for photography. There are some shops which are selling food and dresses
Jim W,"London, UK",Feb 2017,"Nice sandy beach, looked pretty safe, plenty of shade along the hotel front. The water was clean and shallow at the beach edge."
XVictorious,"Austin, TX",Apr 2017,"This beach is the primary reason we travelled to Bali. The fine sand is unlike most beaches in the world. It's principally coral and shell that has been pulverized through millennia. There is little or no quartz or granite in the sand, which makes it great to walk through. The break and shallow tide area extends several hundred meters from the shore. The sand is raked in the am, but you can find coral bits and small shells throughout the day."
debbieSouthampton,southampton,Apr 2017,Although man made this beach is gorgeous. Lots of swimming but make sure you heed the advice about where to swim. It's clean lots of sun beds provided for each hotel
Rix_11,"Kewarra Beach, Australia",Apr 2017,"If you are staying at one of the 5 Str star hotels this is a great stretch of beach. Each hotel has security on hand to protect you from any unwanted attention and they have a variety of facilities. If you are not staying at one of the hotels, you can still enjoy the beach and water along with the range of cafes, restaurants and bars of the hotels. The beach is safe and extremely clean as it is raked every morning. There is a lovely long walking path which is shaded by trees."
JO B,"Manila, Philippines",May 2016,in general a nice beach .......in front of some hotels better then in front of other hotels. swimming only possible at high tide. beware of undercurrents.
janherwitz,"Pacifica, CA",Mar 2017,"Only there for one afternoon using a ""private"" beach from the Grand Bali Nusa Dua (they have a free shuttle). Very clean, very expansive, and low, low tide. Not one of the world's great beaches, but it sure was nice walking about 100 meters in the water and still being at knee's height!"
zesha_machdoem,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2017,"Great great beach if you're after some nice clean golden/white sand away from the hustle and bustle of bali. we stayed at The Mulia in nusa dua and the hotel has a private guest only Beach right by the beach! Excellent, it was clean peaceful beautiful photo worthy beach! loved it x"
Vini Vidi V,286 contributions,Apr 2017,Love this beach  clear  clean waterNice for  relaxing  and swimming Awesome place for families  and watersport.Tides can vary alot depend on time of the day
gavinsch,"Queenstown, New Zealand",Apr 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is terrific goes for miles, very very clean racked every morning. Most places along there have deck chairs etcYou don't get hassled like at Kuta and seminyakVery relaxing and most important the water is crystal clear"
AndrewSwann,"Camberwell, Australia",Apr 2017,"No big swell clean water and not deep. Plenty of activities and generally sheltered from the sellers typical to the area. As a nerd the beach sand is almost completely spherical like little beads. Not everyone cares about this though, I think it's somewhat fascinating."
Geoff S,Bandar Seri bagawan,Mar 2017,Beautiful beach facing the Indian Ocean. The sea can be rough but this makes for great family fun getting smashed by the waves. It gets calmer as the tide goes out for those less adventurous.
ElksLondon,London,Mar 2017,A pleasant enough beach but nothing stunning. Lots of private sections for the 5 star hotels. Lots of beach traders but they don't oversell.
SaraGhavam1979,"Tehran, Iran",Apr 2017,"For people coming to Bali, it's a must see although resorts have practically owned the beach ... but at the night time even, there are happenings."
Kim G,"Kindersley, Canada",Mar 2017,"Lined with hotels and restaurants, but with generous amounts of sand, you will enjoy the ambiance of this beach.  If you are a beginner surfer, you might enjoy taking a lesson and practicing here."
Alex V,15 contributions,Mar 2017,Clean and quite serene beach. The hotels have their own private plots so it is free from the vast amounts of sellers one would expect. Water was quite sandy but appears clean - with the exception of some palm leaves and flowers.  Surf is there but not very strong. Some ripcurrents marked with flags by the life guards. 
NiveditaSamanta,98 contributions,May 2016,Sandy beaches and blue waters- can't complain. It's clean and has some really nice views. Take a bicycle and explore!
AlkaSingh1120,"Faridabad, India",Mar 2017,"White sand, beautiful calm beach. Less crowded and very clean. Shallow water, can walk into upto few metres, in low tide its just knee depth water. Nice to take beach side walk with beautiful and calm surroundings."
Stelios M,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Mar 2017,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt hotel for 5 nights but every morning we were starting the day with long walks on the beach. The water was not very interesting for us (as we live in Cyprus where we have some very clean waters) and the tide made things worst at times.Nevertheless only seeing how long and clean the beach is, is an experience on its own. Sometimes jet lug is good as you wake up from 05.00 in the morning and you get to see the sunrise :)"
Michellecorrey,"Copacabana, Australia",Mar 2017,"White sand, crystal clear aqua water. Good for snorkelling. Very clean beach.  Each hotel has their own section of the beach with Su lounges. Not many beach sellers. "
Guillermo F,MEXICO CITY,Aug 2016,The ocean is aquamarine blue clean beautiful with very low tide you can walk 500 feet and only being knee deep the sand is soft white powder one of the most nicest beaches i ever saw .the beach was secluded at the hotel we stayed weather was sunny the sunset to look just impresive a very romantic place seems like paradise.
Azma O,"Toronto, Canada",May 2016,Definitely more for romance! lol I was unfortunately here on a work trip and the tide was quite low during the time I visited. Beautiful beach nonetheless. Way less touristy than other beaches in Bali. 
P M,San francisco,Feb 2017,"you can walk 300 feet during low tide and was is only knee deep.  beautiful white sand for miles.  There are areas with water sports as well, area outside our hotel is secluded and has few tourists."
Lookwhatlauraloves,"Doha, Qatar",Mar 2017,The water on sunny days was absolutely beautiful however when it was raining the water was very rough. I would not recommend this beach for a family with children due to how strong the tide is. My husband and I who are very strong swimmers were quite nervous with the strength of the waves. It is beautiful to dip in and look at but not the best swimming water. 
michaelt602017,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2017,We enjoyed our daily walks along the beach. Plenty to look at and always nice to have a swim at the many different locations. Never crowded !!!
Priyanka Kwatra,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2017,Beautiful calm beach with lovely places to eat. Good crowd and very clean. A must visit if you are with kids
Natalie K,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beautifully maintained, the sand was raked each morning by various resort staff.  Was very clean & secure"
Karin V,"Zhuhai, China",Mar 2017,"Great beach for swimming, very clean. Great for surfing and walking on the beach, great sunsets. Sales people on the beach a bit too pushy..."
Yacine,58 contributions,Mar 2017,"The beach is very beautiful and calm. Mostly only high end hotels here, not crowded. Was great to enjoy the camel ride on the beach."
Martin M,15 contributions,Mar 2017,Nusa Dua beach is amazing. The water is so blue and like swimming in a bath. There are various bars along the beach and you can walk from one hotel to another 
tlfraser,"Kelowna, Canada",Mar 2017,Clean lovely 😊 Indian Ocean 🌊- great restaurant on the beach to choose from.  Massage tables by the locals -❤️
Virrr777,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2017,This beach is on the West coast of Bali. So there is no Sunset & as it goes NO Crowd :(  you often see people in morning hours & most of this beach is broken down into private Beaches of the Properties around
The Wandering Reviewer,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"There are a number of hotels sprinkled along this beach and I've stayed at the Sheraton myself. It's a gated community and was designed to be an ‘all-inclusive’ type of tourist destination. The complex of world-class hotels, an up-market shopping complex with well-maintained facilities, a luxurious 18-hole golf course, white-golden sandy beaches and much more. The name Nusa Dua is derived from the two small islands to the east. Though it’s the most developed area in Bali, it still houses many temples, a museum, and lots of other attractions. Many people come here for their honeymoon. I found it 'just another' resort in an idylic place.The beach is good and I did see a great sea snake when snorkelling here. Also learnt to windsurf here. There is a reef about 200m off shore which means there is no surf.You will find local vendors trying to sell you stuff but they cannot enter the beach in certain areas so they try to haggle from a distance."
Zoe B,"Castleford, UK",Apr 2016,"not much shop/bar wise but loads of water activities!! jet skis were very good, can start to get pricey!"
KronSlater,38 contributions,Mar 2017,Number 9 gives a great strong massage and is also a great one to bargain with. Always look for number nine!
Mark P,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,"Quiet, peaceful and away from the hustle of other beaches in different resorts. if you want relaxation you should head down to Nusa Dua  "
Liz C,"Clayton, Australia",Mar 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is a beautiful and calm beach, great for swimming and spending the day.We had some lunch at one of the resorts and walked down the beach.Highly recommended :)"
Travel Beyond,"Honolulu, HI",Feb 2017,So nice with lots of restaurants...  This beach is so neat to walk along.  Lots of restaurants and vendors so we can never get hungry.  Hope to return soon.
philjanal,13 contributions,Mar 2017,"Beaches not so safe for anyone unless good swimmer, drop off pretty quick, but there is a safer part near Bali collection, good for kids. "
woo d,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,Beautiful backdrop of the ocean. Clear sea and clean beach. Security on the beach ensure the safety of the visitors staying  
domo82,"Newmarket, UK",Mar 2017,Would be great if not the sea weeds that are verry close to the shore ... not the best beach on the world but nice enough ..  
mxhdapxt,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"Easy access to the beach, no payment required or whatsoever. Beach is clean with beautiful sand and waves. Stretch of beach bars (area is fill with resorts). Beach is not as crowded as Kuta therefore it is worth going to. Good spot for suntanning. Water activities are available there too. If you don't intend to get wet, do not visit the beach. You'll get tempted with all the activities happening there. Ps, they have flowriders there too. Get on to their tiny islands and get to the edge of the cliff for a beautiful photo. If you're a fan of the water and the activities, you'll probably end up spending the whole day at nusa dua beach. Definitely a must place to visit when you're in Bali."
joyance,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"We had our own private beach area, although you can walk down the clean beach to the other side infront of other hotels or resorts. The sand is clean and beach area not to crowded. The waves were huge and since the red and yellow flag was up, we were just by the side to play in the waves, didn't swim out into the sea. With the rushing of the waves, my children had a great time jumping around. You can see many surfing too, I guess the waves are large enough for them. As the tides are strong, you need to be careful with very young children and not let them play alone at the shoreline."
balichick47,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,Clean water Clean sand but our was a private beach Lots of wedding pics being takenGood to people watchLots of choices for food etc
Harshanath I,4 contributions,Mar 2017,Nusa Dua beach is very clean and less crowded.  We stayed at Inaya Putri and had the beach access from the resort. Beach is safe for a swim and ideal for long walks.
Nicole0999,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,"Great clean beach and less touristy. Top restaurant on beach called Kauputi that I would highly recommend. Spectacular beach side view at ""the St Regis"". This area has the best resort hotels in Bali. More upmarket, clean and safer than other parts of Bali. Great shopping nearby with quality shops and restaurants. Ubud would be my second choice but for a different more laid back quiet experience. Enjoy!"
Xavier007_04,"Paris, France",Feb 2017,The beach of the south of Bali the water is clean the sand also.You have a lot of nice restaurant on the beach You can rent surf paddle ect ...
JaneMcc1965,"Manchester, UK",Mar 2017,The beach is huge great for long walks along the sand as well as a bit of beach combing. Very clean & unspoilt Lots of hotels at the back of the beach offering lots of places to eat or get a drink 
shashiwithlove,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2016,Most of the beaches in Bali are clean and they shine blue in afternoon. This beach is also safe and some activities are also done here. This beach is one of the safest to swim beaches in Bali. The sand are soft and great for a visit.
Michael Anbumani,"Seremban, Malaysia",Mar 2017,Beautiful beach with cool clean water. Nice beach to experience with children & adults. One of many popular beaches around Bali. Tourists love this beach.
junior g,Singapore,Mar 2017,A good place for anyone who enjoys white sand beach and clean clear waters. Good for swimming and on certain times for surfing.
Thecoventrykid,"Coventry, UK",Feb 2017,"Watch out for beach sellers selling Kites and dodgy watches. The sea is warm but a little rough, the red flag was flying through out our stay. good for surfing."
TrevorT-Bone,Male,Feb 2017,"I enjoyed the relaxing environment we had here i enjoyed  my pot of coffee just watching the beach and the sea go back and forth, and people watching what more is there todo."
ivan_darius,"Sanur, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"White sand beach, clear water to swim, plenty choices for beach activity, great cocktail at the nearby beach bar. Overall is good."
Mat G,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,I found this beach one of the cleanest (and quietest) in Bali. Sand is white and soft and great for long quiet walks with the one you love !!
Sachelle H,"Paris, France",Mar 2017,"An absolutely beautiful and relaxing beach! The water is a great temperature and nice and flat.There is alot of resirts on the beach that offer different settings, Ayodya resort has the best atmosphere.We hired some bikes and rode along the beach pathway which was lovely."
LILLY_BBB,"Belgrade, Serbia",Oct 2016,"White sand, turquoise water. It's only bad that you can not swim far from the beach. There are warning signs and when you reach them the ocean is still not deep enough. Local residents cannot reach the beach so it's pretty empty. Sometimes you can see few local woman selling souvenirs."
krummeltw,Perth W Australia,Feb 2017,"During our 13 day stay at the Westin Resort Nusa Dua we spent nearly every day swimming at this lovely beach.Water is not the same as you experience in Aussie beaches but is best located beach around Bali coast. Staff work hard to keep beach free of debris, day beds etc are kept clean and you can ask waiters for drinks or snacks.Plenty of activity on the water, snorkelling, jet ski, para gliding, etc. Nice beachfront for a walk, bike ride or stroll along to see the connecting Hotels. Only negative is the constant hassling from the Hawkers."
Terri T,"Calgary, Canada",Feb 2017,Beautiful aqua blue water. Perfect ocean temperature. Not too many peddlers. Lots of great places to eat and drink along the beach.
arievo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Good place for relax in the beach with white sand with long beach line. Located in the heart of Bali and many luxury hotels, make this beach so popular to visit."
RuxtonSun,BC,Feb 2017,"The beach drops off quite quickly at the shore line and then remains the same level for a long ways out.  It is like a huge swimming pool that empties when the tide is out, but then you can explore the tide pools, which is lots of fun!  We aren't surfers, but every day there were people out there catching waves.  It looks like the surf accommodates beginners as well as more advanced surfers.  Being near the equator, the water is always warm!"
Jolandita,"Stara Zagora, Bulgaria",Mar 2017,"One of the best beaches in Bali. Long beach line.Very clean water. Beautiful white sand. There are also lots of water activities especially if you are a beginner. Very good location to watch the sunrise, as well as the low tide periods. We saw some newlyweds taking photo sessions :) The area is quite safe and not overcrowded since most of the luxurious hotels are there. Maybe it is because most of the tourist think it is a private beach only for the hotel guests, but it isn't. There are also some locals selling paintings, wood craft etc. Be prepared to bargain if you want a fare deal :)"
varun b,2 contributions,Feb 2017,Hey friends beach sites view are beautiful so much clean and clear beaches really had so much fun at there
CorporateSud,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2017,A nice peaceful beach for a morning and evening walk with your partner....We enjoyed watching the sunset.......
MrsWarrior,"Birmingham, UK",Nov 2016,Lovely beach. Relaxing. The staff at the villa we were at had recommended this beach to us. We are glad we went. Friendly staff. Happy to help. Plenty of areas to sit and sun bathe or just relax. Drinks available to buy with ice. My husband went for a swim whilst I admired the sandy beach and breeze. Managed to find some beautiful shells that I bought back with me as souvenirs :)
ChristineBALI2016,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,Beautiful white sand (like in Perth Aus) clear water and lots of water activities but all round expensive for Bali
sophiejeffs,3 contributions,Mar 2017,"Great spot for families to stay if you want to relax. Not the best spot for the cheap shopping or cheap massages that most people come for. Here, you will pay a little higher price than in Kuta area but it's a clean sandy beach."
mikemcdowell2014,"Jarrow, UK",Mar 2017,"Great beach that has a gentle slope that is great if you don't want to out of your depth. Lots of sea grass underwater so the shore needs constant cleaning by the hotels...and gets itAll water sports can be catered for with numerous places on the beach offering their services. Don't settle on the first price as they will negotiate even if a few dollars. Bartering is fun so smile and enjoy,don't get annoyed but be prepared to have a walk away price Our friends went on the""flying fish"" and loved it. Hover boarding looked fantastic, looking in the hands of experts, like a scene from the Spiderman moviesPlenty of choice all the way alongLoads of food and juice available all the way along from the blow hole to Holiday InnLast tipTake water...it's gets hot"
JuliannaD,233 contributions,Feb 2017,"...all the visitors no natter from which hotel they are. Nusa Dua beach isn't private but meant to be used by tourists. It's clean and safe as there are security guards everywhere around the area. I'm not sure you'd be offered a hotel sunbed if you're not this particular hotel guest, but you definitely won't be asked to leave once you decided to stay at this beach. Night lighting is lovely)"
George P,"Budapest, Hungary",Jan 2017,"Then youhave got it. One thing you should make sure of though: go to the beaches by the hotel resorts! Those are the real thing really. There are entry points for any tourist, just ask or look for it.Then enjoy!"
636Debbied,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2017,"We spent many hours strolling down this beautiful beach.  Loved it!!  My husband tried his hand at waterskiing, an activity that he hasn't indulged in for many years.  The beach was kept immaculate by many bali workers.  Loved watching the cruise ships that anchored there."
KBJBWM,46 contributions,Feb 2017,Love this beach so much; there are many hotel around this area ! There is the water blow too !! Love it 
kirstyjane,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"Beautiful spot to walk along. Swimming 3/5 and snorkelling not possible. Great location, clean and presentable but don't get excited about tropical island. "
Diogo B,"Munich, Germany",Mar 2017,You cannot swim in the water because it's not so deep. No waves either. Great if you don't like crowded beaches and waves. Good beach for kids too due to the shallow water.
saraleenah,"Velika Gorica, Croatia",Feb 2017,"It is a gorgeous long sandy beach... but all the sunbeds and umbrellas are reserved for hotel guests, from different hotels. It is way to hot to be out on the sun, so you do need a cover, and the only way to do it is to walk all the way to the far end of the beach where the sunbeds can be rented for 50 IDR, however bear in mind that this part of the beach has a red flag for dangerous and it is not for children at all, since the waves are high and they push you back and forth in the shallow parts of the beach. It has a free shower which is great, and the taxis are nearby"
Leah H,24 contributions,Mar 2017,Clean with clear water in February and heaps of water sports.  Beach was kept clean and no hassling however you still could get massages or buy nick backs. 
Saveen S,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2017,"Visited in Feb 2017 and was very very quite during the day time.... believe it, was making some sounds during late hey...."
Tommy C,"Maui, HI",Feb 2017,"Located behind the resorts in the ""resort town"" of Nusa Dua, the beach is a popular place for tourists due to the proximity to their hotels.  The beach is polluted - trash and plastic debris can be found along the shoreline and in the water. Some spots may appear cleaner as some of the resorts rake the trash up each day. Heavy boat and jet ski activity in near-shore waters. The pollution situation on Bali beaches is significant and does not seem to be improving. There is a nice walking path along the beach. Great spot to catch the sunrise."
Ginny M,"Hartford, CT",Feb 2017,"This beach used to be a gem. Unfortunately ocean trash is ruining the beach. Bali needs to figure out how to dispose of its trash in a sustainable way. I don't think I would come back again. Years ago when I visited this beach , the beach and the water was gorgeous. At low tide I walked in tidal pools which looked like they came out of a Natural Geographic magazine. That is all gone now."
travelbugPJ,PJ,Feb 2017,"One of the best beaches around. Beautiful location, fine sands, clear blue water. A great place for a swim or just laze in the sun."
Muhammad Salman,"Lahore, Pakistan",Mar 2016,"It was Great experience to be in Bali for my Business Tour. Great Place, Great food  Great Place. Nice place"
Mukesh70,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2017,"This is one of the beat beaches of Bali. The site which I visited is close to hotel Hyatt. This beach is having slight rocks. Water is slightly dirty, not suitable to bath. Lot of people are visiting here. Good location for photography. There are some shops which are selling food and dresses."
Travelfreak2401,418 contributions,Jan 2017,This is a lovely beach for doing watersports activities...loved the water here...better to visit early morning...becomes very hot in the afternoon
victorl654,"Yucaipa, CA",Feb 2017,Nice beach but if you visit the south or southwest beaches you will be blown away! Visit Sunday's Beach club. 
Grace ܔ,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"This beach is full of water sports equipments, and I thought it would be a nice beach since the tour guide said its one of their top beaches but I cant see any special on this beach. The sand is more like of small stones and brown and painful to walk without sippers. Barely even have a place to chill without getting ask 10 times if you want to do water sports activity."
Gary B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,Very clean beach both sand and water sand is very white and clean water crystal clear and great to swim in walking track along beach or stroll on sand we stayed at grand Hyatt and direct access to beach never busy and not hassled by sellers but there around if you want something
Jenny B,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Feb 2017,The beaches are as beautiful as the photos shows unless the have just had a massive storm!  It's a lot quieter down in Nusa Dua which is great for families!  Be careful as there can be rips so swim between the flags!
mfitriani,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"You can still find a quiet hidden spot in Nusa Dua. It's never as busy as the one in Kuta/Canggu. Lovely beaches with great people. Please pick up your own trash, or other that's around you. We need to take a good care of the places that we visit, even the smallest gesture counts. We come here at least once a week from Ubud."
viktorija,"Hvar, Croatia",Jan 2017,I was there in January and its amazing.... beach is so clean and sea is so green ! Only peace in Bali worth visiting 😄
Refiloe B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Staying at the St Regis meant that we had access to the private beach with its beautiful sunrise. As a runner, I went out every morning on the beach running trail and the beach is just beautiful, Im glad that I stopped to enjoy the sunrise most mornings. Even when it rains its pretty."
Ayman A,10 contributions,Feb 2017,I went to the beach in seminyak and nusa dual and for sure nusa dua is better regarding waves and scenary and the sand 
Bence V,"Budapest, Hungary",Feb 2017,"The good part of this beach is before you hit the water. It is not crowded, clean and nice, the tropical atmosphere is very relaxing.Unfortunately the water is barely transparent, and it is full of jetskis, speedboats and everybody seems to be in a hurry (or rather show off). This makes the beach practically unusable for more peaceful activities like snorkeling, kayaking or swimming."
Petros Ioannou,"Nicosia, Cyprus",Feb 2017,The most amazing and fantastic beach on the whole bali!clean sand that is cleaned every morning and relaxing beds for everyone
zerrin3,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,very clean the sand and the water was just amazing.  Great place to go swimming or go for a long walk
cajafjones,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,Very clean beach and a great place to enjoy the water or just relax. There are a lot of great resorts along this beach with the Inaya Putri  resort one of the best.
YDai,"Shenzhen, China",Feb 2017,"Compared with other beautiful beaches like those in Maldives、Mexico or Sanya, the beach at Bali may be a disappointment. Sand is rough and the color is almost gray, with lots of dirts in the water. "
Gary M,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"Best beach in Bali, this beach is on a very long stretch and is very clean and nice. The sea is calm and there are lots of activities which you can participate in also. "
Christopher V,14 contributions,Sep 2016,"Nusa dua beach is beautiful, it's not the finest sand but the views more than make up for it, some interesting sea life is easily accessible straight from the beach, we went snorkeling in the bay just off the beach, saw many fish."
Sibasish D,30 contributions,Feb 2017,"One of the best beaches in Bali ,Where you can hang around with your family .Altough most of the hotels have their Private Chairs which are reserved for their guests.But still you can hang around there .Great Place we spent almost entire day .You can also do sea surfing there ."
abbeyjennifer,"Cronulla, Australia",Feb 2017,"We visited Nusa Dua Beach yesterday and it was beautiful! Clean sand, clear blue and very warm water! It is a nice beach to swim at, although the waves were huge and if you don't go out far enough, your feet get swept up underneath you and you end up getting dumped in the wave! Very nice beach though! "
Tengiz_D,"Jurmala, Latvia",Feb 2017,"Clean, soft and beautiful, nice sand and water, so you can not only photo it, but swim also with your children"
soodprashant,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2017,Its a beautiful beach with many bays. Slightly rocky. Many water sports are available. Must for a run! 
Mithun S,6 contributions,Jan 2017,This beach is usually very crowded as it is visited by the locals too.However it wasn't dirty and was well maintained. A good place to visit but definitely not mandatory. 
peyman s,"Tehran, Iran",Feb 2017,"It has white sand, very clean, various hotels and bars, soft sand, its not as lively as other beaches is bali,  yet it depends what you are after."
Carmigcar,Spain,Jan 2017,"We spent the day here with our balinese friend butu and his family. Very crowded but well worth the visit. Rented some loungers & spent most of the day in and out of the sea. Legs quite raw by being tossed around in the waves. Quite rough golden sand, boats to rent, massage etc."
terrykow,189 contributions,Jan 2017,"We were brought by a tour guide to nusa dua for snorkeling and water sport. Really dissappointed. The water is not clear at all and strong wave. Snorkeling and diving are wasting time. The boat for tourists are old and handled by local ppl. The safety awareness is very low. We realised there were only 5 life jackets for 7 ppl and 2 of the jacket were broken. Later, I found out from local ppl that the sea water at nusa dua is only be clear at August but strong wave plus dark at January. OMG,  tour guide and the water sport staff were never inform us about this. They just encourage you to go go go to earn your money by jeopardising your safety."
Beca15Ler,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,Nice clean water and white sand is suitable for relax and get sun during see the blue ocean. also close to the many restaurant 
Rosario E,47 contributions,Jan 2017,"I would avoid Nusa Dua, the sea has oil and the beach is so so, is better to go to the other side of the peninsula, Padang Padang beach - Rock Bar and if you want to go southern the best is the Sundays beach club, on both options you need to pay but it worth it. Nusa Dua is done! "
ArneMid,"Oslo, Norway",Jan 2017,"We are taking a few days of during CNY from Kuala Lumpur, thus wanted to try Bali this time. Nusa Dua beach is very nice by sand and water quality. Nice promenade along the beach also. But, the tide was a bit hefty, thus at low tide, it was not possible to go for any swim."
WWong77,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Also like a private beach as it mainly only the resort guest uses it but disappointed with cleanliness, lots of plastic bags and plastic bottles in the water."
bamunited2017,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"Beautiful idillic area, gorgeous.Views are beautiful of mountains and islands in the distance.Quiet for the majority of areas that are private for the resorts.Shame about the rubbish, particularly in the areas that aren't private, as the majority of locals and kids seem to swim in these areas but there's so much rubbish everywhere :("
H109,"Lund, Sweden",Jan 2017,Fantastic beach! Clean water and shore. Well organized service from the hotel.Perfect for long walks.
Wisnu A,16 contributions,Jan 2017,"I always come to this place like 2 times a month. Calming atmosphere, and sometimes I do jogging on the Peninsula Island. And if you wanna watch the sunrise, go to the waterblow"
Mathurahan S,"Vavuniya, Sri Lanka",Sep 2016,"Born and Grown in country full of great beaches,  I really enjoyed my trip to Bali. Especially for it's water games. Very clean beachesNot much disturbance from sellers. You will enjoy ur time in Bali... "
Kepr,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,"Beautiful beach..clear water, lovely sand. Excellent beachfront walkway in front of all of the luxury resorts & their restaurants, which are open to the public. You pay for the upmarket area, but still a great place to sit back & enjoy. Nusa Dua means 2 islands (they are actually headlands) that are interesting to visit. One has a temple  on it & the other has a big park with a huge statue & ""the blow"". "
GuideSabina,"Prague, Czech Republic",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dua is long stretch which I would describe in two sections.The first/northern part with the promenade marked on maps is beach with pricey resorts which take their section of the beach and water sports.The second/southern part (Mengiat beach) we liked much better as there is no section designated to a resort. This is nice long stretch of clean sandy beach where you can get sun chairs and umbrellas (or not if you do not want to), you can hire a kayak or just enjoy swimming or snorkeling. This was our favorite place which we have visited several times."
zjv76,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,By Balinese standards this is a very nice beach for families.  It's very calm and quite clean.The hotels ensure they clean their strip of beach daily to keep it looking good.
DITSVK2016,"Kozhikode, India",Jan 2017,It's nice and clean beach Especially for surfing Who love surfing can choose it Local Peoples are nice and honest Regards Vk
Nihar Shah,125 contributions,Jan 2017,"I would recommend Nusa Dua beaches for swims and relaxation.. Much better than Kuta or Seminyak where there are hundreds of people, vendors, etc. to bother you.."
Intan_edinin,"Semarang, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"Nusa dua beach was very beautiful, it has beautiful white sand and very clean. It very comfort to play in nusa dua beach with your children and nusa dua beach not too crowded."
glust,South Korea,Jan 2017,This is a calm type of beach. The sand is good and the water is kind of clear but not for too much snorkeling.
Sandy_Roadwarrior,"Ooty (Udhagamandalam), India",Feb 2016,Decent experience. But there are definitely better places/beaches in Bali. Avoid watersports in this area. Not the best of equipment used 
CarlyLovesCoffee,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2016,"Stunning! We stayed at Holiday Inn and wandered along the beach. You can buy corn and sarongs etc from beach vendors, but it is not overcrowded. Action and adventure water sports are popular here. We loved it. "
JessPattoAUS,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dua beaches are by far the best in bali.. white sand and blue water! If I was to return to Bali for another beach holiday, Id go back for sure!"

Tanuj Goyal,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2017,My resort was on Nusa Dua beach only.  Water is clean and calm. Not much crowded (atleast the resort where we stayed). Enjoyed the place.
Barbara L,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,"I think this beach has both beauty & tranquillity and offers a beautiful sunset in the evening.  The sand and surrounds were clean and the kids enjoyed playing and swimming.  There was a few waves, so keep an eye on the less strong swimmers.  A lot of beautiful hotels share this beach."
peterkrisjones,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,great beach that is clean and free from hawkers. protected reef allows for calm swimming. coral can be uncomfortable under foot but great to just sit in water and float.
travel_yoda_aus,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,"Came here for swimming as Kuta / Legian beaches in Dec / Jan are literally swimming with plastics and garbage. Nusa Dua was great! Clean waters. Two chairs and umbrella 100,000 and same prices you would find anywhere in Bali..."
GeordieGirl71,NorthEast,Jan 2017,"Melia Bali, Indonesia is well worth a visit! Beautiful beach, lovely hotel and friendly and attentive staff, from reception to waiting staff, they are all helpful and efficient "
Joanne J,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Without a doubt this is the cleanest, calmest, coolest beach in Nusa Dua.  They trek in new bags of pristine yellow sand every so often, and on an early beach walk you ll be meeting the guys that rake and clean the Bay every day. The currents are manageable and safe for most swimmers. There are only ""hotel approved"" hawkers, so you aren't in for a bun fight if you need to grab the odd new Sarong. In fact, they became friends of ours over a week's stay, beautiful and peaceful locals. It has back to back, immaculate beach dining too. Such a lovely place to spend the day."
susanlK5543WN,Darwin,Jan 2017,"We didn't pay for any water sports, just sat in the beautiful water and enjoyed the sun. We also did not purchase food but it was available for guests from our hotel ( private beach)."
Sarah D,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2017,"We did a tour of Bali's beaches, and this was by far the cleanest and nicest.  It didn't have any rubbish on it, or in the water that we could see.  It's in a private estate of 5 star resorts.  As opposed to Kuta, Sanur or Seminyak beaches it was clean, it looked nice and blue, and it made us want to swim.  It's got a little bay area, where it's great for kayaking and stand up paddle boarding."
Mary C,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"I'm not one for the beach however I have fallen in love with the beach at Nusa Dua.It's like swimming in a warm water bath, the sand is clean, the water is clear and the warm breeze just flows over your body.  Just Devine.You can hire a lounge under a tree or umbrella for around $5.  There are outdoor showers to freshen up and toilets.There are plenty of eateries around.   In our first visit to the beach we were on the side closer to the blow hole.  Where we ate at a place located on the beach.   On our second visit we were closer to the beach near Inaya resort.  I preferred this location. We had lunch at Inaya resorts Ja'Jan cafe, all I can say is wow, amazing.Didn't want to leave this place it's truely a little piece of paradise."
Senior Writer,"Vancouver Island, Canada",Dec 2016,Lovely white sand beach itch access from numerous hotels in Nusa Dua. Not a surfing beach as waves were small.
btwatkins,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"Take a stroll ,sunbake or a swim...fresh ..relaxing Devine way to spend a recharge ...gorgeous beaches"
harjeetb2017,"Dehradun, India",Dec 2016,Nice and beautiful beach with  five star hotels nearby. The restaurants at the hotels   gives you a good deal of choice. The water sports available include para-sailing and jet skiing as well as snorkelling and good for swimming.
Gaurav B,11 contributions,Jan 2017,Best beach in Bali if you want really good sand and sun. Advisable to go by cab as we were staying in seminyak (45min drive). Had an amazing day at beach. Be careful of prices as this is a premium beach. Would advise shoppers to do shopping in Kuta and Seminyak (we brought stuff which was at 50% cost in other places)...
MiamiTravelBug,Miami,Jan 2017,"This is the 4th beach I visited in Bali.It is also the cleanest and calmest. Sand is nearly white and very soft. Staff members are constantly cleaning up any seawead that washes ashore.Although there are a few hustlers here, they are regulated and don't persist as heavily as they do at other beaches."
willy219,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"I visited Nusa Dua beach directly from my hotel (Inaya Putri Bali). The beach is amazingly clean and fully maintain, because I saw a man who always do clean up whenever the wave bring some trash to the beach, he will collect them and put to the proper place. My kids are really really love this beach..."
locsnfreckles,"England, UK",Jan 2017,"I spent my entire afternoon on the beach, which was so amazing for me. I didnt have to move for food or drinks; only to get in the water and relax."
Dawn N,Mauritius,Jan 2017,Great beach. Soft waves. Lots of small be cases to choose from. Vendors available and lots of hotel restaurants to have coffee and chill. Quiet and peaceful. Plenty of water sports available. 
Larrabarb,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2016,Excellent area to compare with the frenetic Kuta Legian area.  Calm and beautiful where you do not need to go far.
t2lae,"Richmond, Australia",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dui beach is not bad, it's swim able with clear enough water. White sand but the tide was very low at the time I went. Not much waves, more like a swimming beach than surfing. Lots of Russian tourists sun tanning on the beach. There's better beaches in Bali. Average but not great, cleaner than seminyak beach. "
Swati C,3 contributions,Dec 2016,"This beach is just behind the Ayodya resort where we stayed, had access to it 24 hours. Nice clean and clear water. "
Loves2TravelALOT_11,"Huntington Beach, CA",Jan 2017,This beach is peaceful and exotic. The sand is fine and feels so goo on bare feet. The Indian Ocean water is warm and relaxing. A perfect place to spend the day.
Carol P,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Dec 2016,"Nusa Dua is a lovely beach which is surrounded by five star hotels.  The restaurants at the hotels are available for all to eat at, which gives you a good deal of choice.  The water sports available include para sailing and jet skiing as well as snorkelling.  We also got on the glass bottom boat which allows you to see in the water.The areas are quite separate so no issues with swimming.  Most of the hotels offer massage and spa but on the beach there are many locals that offer massages for a fraction of the price.  It depends on what you are looking for.  My husband and son went to the Sofitel for theirs.  They only take local currency but there is a money changer in the hotel."
RajaSmoothie81,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,"This resort has it all...manicured gardens, yoga, spa treatments, 4 pools, beach, restaurants, child-friendly and other physical activities. The staff are friendly and helpful and I had a very relaxing holiday."
debgods,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"While staying at Nusa Dua we walked the beach every morning & found it to be clean & free from rubbish, unlike Jimbaran beach."
Chris H,"Munich, Germany",Jan 2017,"We stayed in Courtyard which offers a free shuttle to their ""private"" beach or you can walk there in 15 minutes. Lots of hotels have their private section where you have chairs, drinks etc and the sales people don't approach you. With small kids it is nice as the water is very shallow.The beach itself is public but obviously the hotels do a good job cleaning it up from trash. The opposite you'll find on the northern side where there is a mix of erosion from the water and also lots of trash that noone feels responsible for. Though in the water on both sides you will swim with a lot of plastic particles! Quite sad also to see that a lot of locals throw their cigarettes at the beach or in the waters or have Picknick and don't bother to clean up after. Nusa Dua is supposed to be one of the nicer beaches on Bali but if you want to go for a beach vacation find a cleaner beach somewhere else."
saltis,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jan 2017,"Nice to walk on and nice to swim in morning when sea is less wild, water in january was very warm and not so clear"
Raps95,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,"Great surf and very family friendly beaches. Hire a surfboard or SUP, or grab a bike for a ride around the hotels."
Elizabeth B,9 contributions,Jan 2017,"this place so amazing, quiet atmosphere with white sand make my heart peacefully fallin love with this beach. sitting down, relax and get meditation then i've got a great day."
raghav_kapur5,"Dehradun, India",Jan 2017,"The beach is beautiful, clean and well maintained. It has been kept clean and green and serves as a reminder of the beauty of this beautiful country. "
Philip C,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,"These are amongst some of the best beaches in Bali, great surf and surrounded by luxurious 5 star hotels. A must visit on a trip to Bali "
Hanan H,"San Ignacio, Belize",Jan 2017,By far the best beach in Bali we have seen. If you are here it's worth checking out and once you do you won't leave you will keep coming back. Even if you are staying in another hotel make sure to come here. Blue water white sand everything you need. Great food and drinks you can pay to sit at one of the hotels umbrellas if you order food and drinks and spend the day there. We checked out a few beaches and this was by far the best. Also if you fancy a surf lesson you can do it here. 
Nicole M,"Jarrahdale, Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2017,"Gorgeous, clean beach beautiful blue water, was lovely to swim in much nicer than in Kuta / Legian area."
escapebo,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"It was calm conditions when we were there and also clean,we saw lots of beaches in Bali, extremely dirty, unpleasant . This is well protected."
Masud_Odvut_Dunia,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Sep 2016,Beaches are with different view in different part of Bali and this one is an excellent one. This is a bit quiet one. You can enjoy sun bath or just see the low tides here...its a place of scenic beauty.
Eizel7777,"Tavaksay, Uzbekistan",Jan 2017,"Premium place in Bali! Expensive over 2-3 times then Kuta, but for premium you have to pay. Security level is high."
Liambo,"Belfast, UK",Jan 2017,We found the beach to be grand if a little 'untidy'.  It is a shared beach with other hotels and could probably do with litter picker every day. 
moju72,Delhi,Dec 2016,Beautiful beach that is cleaned every morning. Safe. We weren't bothered by hawkers either. This beach fronts several 5 star resorts.
Tonyrandall3,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,"This beach is nice and quiet, clean and very nice to just lay around on for hours and hours. Its great for kids, and its quiet safe. There is not a lot of waves so its a great place that you can just wade around in for hours.When you are looking for lunch or something to drink, you can just walk up the beach and there is a variety of options for you and your family to choose from."
Shane71WA,perth,Jan 2017,Nice clean extreamly tidy beach that was quiet.Not many people on the beach no matter what time of the day or night we went
55scott,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"Hi a Guys, were staying at the Bali Hyatt, which is on the beach, nice beach gutter to swim in, the sandbar / reef effect puts the surf about 60 mts out, so if swimming isn't your strong point or the kids want to paddle this may be for you. There's a surf school outside the Hyatt grounds, so get the kids lessons, you won't regret it,  So do yourself a favour, get out of the banana lounge walk to Nusa Dua beach, put on the budgie smugglers and have a dip.  Regards Scott Land of Oz 😁😎"
0jaya,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"Great place to surf. Warm water. Lots of great places to eat along the beach!!!! Had a great stay!!!Sincerely, Jaya"
POLARBEAR81,"Kerobokan Kelod, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"relaxing beach, not so crowded and very nice view with clear water. There are hecklers on the beach but not as bad as thailand..."
easterntreker,"Halifax, Canada",Feb 2016,This is a lovely beach and a really peaceful place not too crowded. The beach is wide and water was warm . Really clean and a safe haven for sure.
Yohan Thilakaratne,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Jan 2017,The beach is very clean and well maintained along the Grand Hyatt area... ideal for jogging and walking in the morning. The people are nice and friendly.
tinapanayi2016,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2017,Another lovely beach however if you are not in a hotel on the beach there is very little non-hotel guest facilities such as deck chairs etc. area typically used by hotel guests  only.Non-hotel residents only have a very small area to make use of or sit on the sand where there is no shade. 
medvtan,"Manila, Philippines",Jan 2017,"If you have done your research then you would know that this part of Bali was developed for the tourists. I feel safe in this area. There is no traffic. It offers a quiet escape from reality. It is only 25 minutes away from the airport. The beach itself is clean, the whole area is clean! I love the feeling of walking along the beach then going to the mall by foot with sand on your feet. The mall itself is different from the usual mall. It has an open air vibe. "
Jarosław M,75 contributions,Jun 2016,"A lovely beach, not crowded and very clean which is EXTREMELY important to us.Simply beautiful, but definitely not the best beach we have ever been as it is hampered slightly by the use of noisy jet skis."
Giovanni G,"Florianopolis, SC",Jan 2017,"It depends what you are used to (we travel full time), and while one of the best beaches in the area, it's still an average beach at best compared to many other places. The good news is that it's clean in front of the resorts, many of them are great quality resorts. Snorkelling is not really worth it, but there are plenty of opportunities to go diving, 45-60 boat rides bring you to some great spots.Lots of people on the beach selling water sport activities, diving, boat trips etc. Avoid booking with them.All in all, ok-good beach to Bali's standards. "
Oh Huds,Singapore,Jan 2017,It's a beautiful place to visit especially with family and friends. It's really a relaxing place for panic and sea activity. Chill by the beach. It's lovely. 
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Very clean long stretch of beach with numerous luxury hotels built along it...water sports are nearby...
natnoodle11,"Norfolk, VA",Jan 2017,"It was perfect for my son to play in the beach as well. The waters were calmer toward the beach, there was plenty of space and beach options all around. We also had lunch at a very nice local place close to the beach. We walked around at the shops afterward and had a nice Starbucks drink as well. It was a really great beach option in the southern Bali area, and you can also see the Water Blow area by there. There is a nice, large park with a monument right by the beach as well."
Len D,"Miranda, Australia",Jun 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is nothing like any other part of Bali 🌴🌺 it's perfect beach and unbelievable Resorts and a beautiful walk way that's so good to walk along morning and early afternoon , you always get a fabulous breeze 😀😀😀😀😀🌴🌺🌴🌺All of the Resorts are Fantasic, Iv stayed in every single one of them 🎈🌺🌴❤️🎈🌴🌺🎈😀😀😀😀👍👍👍👍The Grand Hyatt is the bees knees if you stay in a Club room, the evening cocktails, private Club pool and gorgeous rooms makes it hard to beat !!! 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 Ducks walk around and the birds and fish make it tranquility and relaxing The Sofitel is also hard to beat ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️🌴🌴🌴🌴 again if you stay room you get all the additional benefits of evening cocktails 🍷🍸🍹🍺🍾🍷🍸🍹🍺🍶🍷🍸🍹🍺🍾🍾🍾🍾🍸🍸🍸🍹🍹🍹🍷🍹🍷🍹🍾🍾🍾🍾🍾 they don't have a separate pool for Club guests, however the mail pool is to die for 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍 it has a swim up bar, great music playing, a lounge pool area where you can have tapas and the lagoon rooms wrap around the pool which makes it so cool enabling you to swim from your room to the pool and bar ❤️😍👍❤️😍👍❤️😍👍🌴🌺🌺🌴🌺🍷🍸🍷🍸💃🏻💃🏻The Nusa Dua beach resort is also fantastic, the Club room is very special with beautiful green grounds, Ducks come to be fed at certain times of the day, breakfast is Amazing ☕️🍏🍎🍐🍊🍋🍌🍉🍇🍓🍒☕️☕️☕️ all rooms are lovely the club pool access lagoon rooms are just beautiful ❤️😍😀❤️😍😀 The restaurants are all fabulous !

Seira R,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"The beach is clean, but I think it's got abrasion since the last time I was there 10 years ago. Totally different, but still beautiful. Not too crowded, local people can visit and interact with hotel guest , nice place to go"
Kris B,"Canet-en-Roussillon, France",Jan 2017,"Great place, great people, perfect relax. We were on two day tours and diving trip. There is plenty of massage places, very tasty food and lots of sun!"
Reisende_Sun,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2016,"The beach is clean and well maintained, but there are a number of locals in blue shirts with numbers on their backs who walk around trying to sell you everything from a ride on a boat to cheaply made dresses. I understand that is how they make a living, but I just want to enjoy the beach, not have to tell someone every 5 mins that I do not want a ride a banana float."
Kitkat071,"Canning Vale, Australia",Dec 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is clean and feels lovely on your feet nothing like the kuta beaches where the beach is bulldozed every day to clean the rubbish that washes up from Java.  nice to see the sunrise from in the morning.  
surasen2012,43 contributions,Dec 2016,Was not impressed with the beach....alot of coral and rocks...stayed at club med and only explored that stretch of beach....
jacquelinemdunn,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,"Found the beach to be clean, was unable to swim as it was rough and strong current. Life guard on duty. good to lay down and relax by. "
IslanderWC,"Sedgefield, South Africa",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is great any time of the day. We have been there at sunrise, sunset and in between. Safe for swimming and plenty of activities if you are into that sort of thing "
Adrian L,"Munich, Germany",Jan 2017,"Almost white sand, clean water and clean beach (even at rainy season / Dez. 2016).Difficult to find, but when you are down the stairs, it's awesome! "
tracey k,"Legana, Australia",Dec 2016,"We love Nusa Dua because there aren't such crowds as at Kuta Beach.  If you're after surf waves you won't like Nusa Dua, but if you want to enjoy the water and maybe a little water sports then Nusa Dua is the place for you and your family.  Some parts of the beach are very well maintained while other parts are a little dirty.  I think it depends on the hotels which have beachfront access."
imadedwijananda,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"i reallly enjoyed to walk through this beach line. people so friendly and fantastic. i love Bali so much, "
Leslie D,"China Spring, TX",Dec 2016,Beautiful beach. Very few vendors- but the ones there are have good stuff. Get a Bali massage on the beach in a private tent! Trust me in this!
Nick T,"Salmiya, Kuwait",Jan 2017,"The beach is really nice and sandy. The waves break on the reef just off shore and its gets really shallow as the tide goes out. The coral is sharp so watch your feet! There are plenty of water sports however, with the exception of surfing you will be taken to another beach if you want to do water sports. The public beach has life guards on duty so if you are in sight of them you will be looked after should you get into trouble. Massages are available as well as cheap cafes or more expensive hotels."
Colomba S,13 contributions,Dec 2016,The beach looked great but I couldn't see any life savers on duty. Especially when the sand in the beach in the water is like quicksand and if your not a strong swimmer you would be in trouble. There should be signs with warnings and lifeguards on patrol 24/7. It's an accident waiting to happen. I suggest you swim in the resort pool its much safer. 
Trent890,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,The beach is not crowded at all and very clean. Great for some nice pictures. Does not have big waves which you get in other beaches such as Kuta or Pandawa. 
Stefan S,"Shenzhen, China",Dec 2016,"We went to Nusa Dua Gerber Beach.  This is close to St Regis Hotel (if you have a car put St Regis in your GPS, then just pass the hotel and turn left).The beach is really clean.  You pay a small 3.000 Rp p.p. entrance fee, then u can enjoy a nice afternoon or day in the clean water and white sand.Relax is the name of the game!"
Charlette Bree,"Wollongong, Australia",Dec 2016,"Nusa Dua beach was much better than I expected. We had been to Bali a few times before but had always stayed in the Kuta area, so Nusa Dua was a nice change.The beach is very large, clean, safe, and convenient for us as we were staying at the Grand Hyatt. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."
Divyendu,"Navi Mumbai, India",Oct 2016,"I liked the Nusa Dua Beach. During my stay in WestIn,i regularly jog  in the morning. Yes, they also had jogging track along the beach.Nice."
Ts S,399 contributions,Dec 2016,"It's worth the one hour trip from Legian. Clean water with warm temperature. Nice area with bars and local food.great surf area,you can take surf classes or rent a surf board for the day."
yesduhh,"Cochabamba, Bolivia",Dec 2016,"Recommended if you have no place better for the beach.  Came here  after disappointing experiences in "" Dreamland "" beach as well as Padang Padang Beach, where there was too much garbage or too many obnoxious people.As far as I know, this might be the only beach in Bali that is not covered in litter.  It ranks up there with average beaches in Thailand.  Only one public vehicle access so unless you are staying at one of the expensive resorts, you must rent a chair at the one smallish area near the public parking, but really not to bad.  Average food fare and beer prices.  Loungers with umbrella, 50K.  Trasnport Cost from the airport (Kuta) area:  we paid a driver 50K for 5 hours at the beach.   Tell driver to take the toll road, and arrive before 11 in good weather to if you want a lounger."
Billie F,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Dec 2016,I love the Nusa dua beach. The white sands are incredible. Not too crowded in the beach and so we could relax much better
Igor S,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2016,"This is the beach for people looking for a quiet and relaxing spot to enjoy sea, clean sand and some snorkeling. Very clean and safe, unlike some of the beaches in much busier nearby Semenyak."
Aisha W,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,This beach offers a variety of water sports and an opportunity to sun bathe or relax. It was part of our hotel in Nusa Dua so we had access to the spa as well. There are drinks and restaurants for food. Entry into the waters can be a bit rough due to shells and pieces of stone. However once in its perfect. There are women selling sarongs and dresses and they are reluctant to accept NO as an answer which leads to them becoming tiresome. Enjoyed this beach very much. 
fly fly away fly,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2016,Bali is just abeautiful place u just have to visit it the people are amazing the sea is so calm and nice nusa dua is abeautiful area amazing 
Bo Q,"Shanghai, China",Jan 2016,The beach is not top level comparing to the onces in Thai or Phil. the sand is not very soft you can feel small stones and dead coral shells. I don't know why but the wave is very small beside the beach. it's a great place for family with kids
JIMMY C,9 contributions,Dec 2016,"Bali. A land of gods & beauty. About 90% of the locals there are Hindu and the places there are surprisingly cleaner than some other south east Asia countries we have been to. Tourist attractions are in Ulu Watu, Jimbaran, Ubud and shopping belts are mostly centred around Seminyak & Kuta. We travelled in mid December and weather  is hot & humid without rain.With 3D4N, we covered almost all areas in south Bali except Legian."
NowAngeloti,"Genoa, Italy",Nov 2016,"I was in some beaches in Bali but I think this one is the nicest and calmest to swim ,was staying  a bit far (about 16 km+) but almost every day I was coming here!!!!!"
Anil12TRIP,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2016,Nice private beach great location. You can swim and it's perfect location for a family outing. Close to the hotel restaurant. 
jean1louw,"Beijing, China",Dec 2016,Nusa Dua beaches was clean and mostly protected from the December weather conditions.Nice for swimming and can also accommodate surfers.
bmayet,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2016,Lovely beach. Great for romantic strolls and spending the evening under the stars. The waves are not great for snorkellibg or diving but great for young families anf couple.
Boyd J,"Maleny, Australia",Dec 2016,There is a small public beach area and many luxury resorts have sections set aside for guests to relax on the beach.  It is regularly cleaned and consequently is largely litter free and the sand is soft.
Michael A,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,Has the advantage of reef then a drop off and all that brings and less plastic than the rest so better than all the beaches in the south.Authorities need to do much much more about plastic and other filth in the water than they do.We will not be returning until we hear there has been change as water sports are important to us.
Humbirdi,"Caloundra, Australia",Dec 2016,"The beach is lovely and the water is clean and clear. The walk along either end of the beach is good for a work out as the sand is soft and like quicksand closer to the water. Really loved walking along looking at the shells and saying hello to the fishermen.  If it is really hard going you can also go along the footpath that runs from one end of the beach to the other.  At the blowhole end there are markets.  Its great to walk along and check out each hotel and then stop for lunch or dinner.  You can get to the Bali Connection shops through the Hyatt, which may not be allowed but we snuck through!  I don't know what the beach is like during high season but we found it great and not crowded. Lovely at night too."
Marioncoburn,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Dec 2016,Beautiful beach with white sand and very safe. Lots of surfers out with lots of learners as well. Nowhere near as busy as Kuta which makes it so much better.if you are not staying in Nusa Dua take a day trip out here. The Grand Bali have a private beach club at the blow hole end of the beach and you can pay for a lounger to use with umbrella. They also have a bar and food available. 
Samuel D,"Solo, Indonesia",Dec 2016,This place is one of our favorite beach to be visited For it is clean and white sand.Children are enjoyed playing by the beach.In the evening the wind is a bit strong so you can have quite a big wave .Overall it is really a nice place 
Shan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,Very clean beach compared to Kuta lots of expensive 5 stars hotel situated here. But the cleanliness of the beach was really pleasing and less crowded compared to the others:)
roberthklein,"Kamala, Thailand",Dec 2016,Stunning little place on earth - lovely paradise. Had a great time on Nusa Dua beach and really like my time there!
Yogananthan D,"Bangalore District, India",Dec 2016,"Great time at the beach, clean and not very crowded. The water is very clear. A great beach for family."
Annette L,"Daytona Beach, FL",Dec 2016,Great beach lots to see but really more for relaxing in Bali check out resorts to see artwork and fine dining all resorts have something good to offer 
Shazonthego,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"Better than beaches in Seminyak, Legian or Kuta for cleanliness but nothing compared to endless white pristine beaches on the coast of Western Australia.  We are very spoilt there. "
ali1610,34 contributions,Dec 2016,"Great , clean , beautiful , with all you need there .Enjoy with sun but don't forget sun protection .If you love beaches you reach your order .Some of water sport there .If some beach vendors come to you buy from them ( after some negotiation ) trust me you get a good price than shops ."
Harianto C,12 contributions,Dec 2016,"Overall the the beach is wow, clean and peace, beautiful, the sunrise is good. Want to visit again and again !"
Gvv V,53 contributions,Sep 2016,"This space is very nice ,water and area is clean ..to many people's but ok is normal ..if you visit Bali visit this area"
Abheesh E,Mauritius,Dec 2016,"We found the Nusa Dua region when going to the Devdan Show and decided that we must come back to the quaint little town. Te town in itself is very scenic and very clean, almost too picture-perfect. The Nusa Dua beach is by far my favourite beach in Bali as it is very very very quiet and one can access a small temple which is hidden amidst the beach. The view from the small temple is spectacular. The beach is also very quiet unlike the other beaches in Bali (i.e. Kuta and Jimbaran) so it is a nice change  and its a great place to lazily lounge around and do nothing! For lunch, there is a small mall not far off the beach and there are a few local street food stalls near the beach. "
Sannyasin,38 contributions,Dec 2016,"Beautiful beach, soft sand and small waves.. Had a great time at the blow hole and looking at beautiful hotels, water park and restaurants"
Marjen183,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"We visited the stretch of beach reserved for Amarterra Resort guests and found the sand to be clean and the small waves manageable. We were offered various craft work by beach vendors but they didn't push the issue when we showed we weren't interested. There are plenty of restaurants along this stretch, so if you are peckish or thirsty you don't have far to go. Our only gripe was the rocks and loose coral in the shallows, but once you navigate over these, the swimming is fine."
Gsouan,"Santorini, Greece",Nov 2016,Nusa dua beach is very nice and clean beach!the water is not deep and its perfect if you like SUP!you must visit it if you go to Bali
Pavli,World,Dec 2016,"Nusa Dua is generally nice part of Bali (definitely nicer than Kuta) and its beach is beautiful, long, shallow and clean! We came across Nusa Dua by acciddent and didnt know where we were driving, we ended up at the entrance to Nusa Dua hotel resorts and as there was free entry we went in and park our motorcycle near hotel resort called Melia. We found an amazing beach!! Beach is really long and I would say that each part belongs to different resort. Our was with free entry but I am not aure about other resorts. We also had a lunch at Melia beach restaurant which was not only for its guests but also free to public. Food was good but quite expensive. Both beach and the resort looked very well looked after - spotless! There were lots of locals offering us a sun bed or water sports. I highly recommend Nusa Dua beaches to visit! "
HishamZarinaAnwar,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,"If you want a quite place and just relax by the beach, this is the place. Good for family and couple. Clean and nice view."
Jade O,"London, UK",Dec 2016,"First of all this is a very long beach! So don't be put off Incase you visit the wrong part. We visited the part near the St.Regis... absolutely stunning... clear water and clean sand.We actually stayed up at the Bali Tropic, where the stretch beach is nowhere near as nice...dark water and dirty looking. Be sure to visit the right part and you won't be disappointed!"
jenabaintheworld,"Washington DC, DC",Dec 2016,lovely white sandy beach with gentle surf.   long expanse of beach along  multiple hotels.    felt very safe to walk along.    lovely views.
Shaun S,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2016,"We enjoyed the beach as there are many places to relax. Good food and drinks everywhere, but I will say pick your places as the price for drinks change greatly. Never got hassled like Kuta, which makes a difference. Good to ride a bike along the beach. "
Adelia R,26 contributions,Dec 2016,We went here with motorbike and found shortcut next to Hilton Hotel. The road is still unfinished so you have to walk down some stairs but the view is totally breathtaking. I would recommend coming here in the early morning.
Keti G,7 contributions,Sep 2016,"The beaches are beautiful with white sand in a calm bay so perfect for swimming in the sea and for families. The hotels are generally international brands with a great choice of facilities, immaculate gardens and relaxed ambiance."
diwoll,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,Sadly the day we went it was horrible.  Water was full of rubbish and some sort of oil slick was floating on the top.  We were hounded by hawkers - we were promised we wouldn't be.  Really disappointing.
Tulkara,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,Our hotel is not on the beach but has a private beach area here. Advertised as beautiful and clean off we went. On arrival it looked great but as we ran to the water things changed. Floating all over the surface as far as you could see was garbage and some unknown sludge. We have been to a lot of beaches all over the world and this one is firmly placed at the bottom of the list. It was back to the pool fighting past the hawkers that were lining up with their bags of wares. Worst of the worst. 
Fifi_Mothei,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Oct 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean. All the hotels with beach clubs are doing a very good job maintaining it and providing good service at the bars. When the sun sets, tables and chairs will be set out along the beach for those who would like a candle lit dinner by the beach. Very romantic, a definite must do while in Bali. "
Uncle_Vin,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,not the white sand type and quite coarse actually so you need to wear something walking on the beach. not in  tourist season so the beach is empty! my private beach 
917jodi,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Nov 2016,Clean sand and blue water made this a nice stop. The water became deep very quickly and there was only one restaurant in the area but definitely worth a visit.
grandbalitour,13 contributions,May 2016,"Very fantastic nice view of this beach, A nice and clean beach where no one bothers you. Enjoy, relax and relax. This is a must go place and an experience in itself. In the free time, go to some of the selection "
PJC19642014,"Lisbon, Portugal",Dec 2016,"Surprisingly nearby Dempasar's airport and surrounded by VIP Resorts, with  ""restricted"" access to balinese , these beach is clean, calm with no sellers following you, diferent to all other beaches I've visited in Bali."
Mpressnix,"New York City, NY",Aug 2016,"Nusa Dua Beach is an exclusive and beautiful stretch of sand in Bali.  This beach has amazing sunrises.  If you are there during the full moon, it is quite an amazing site.  The water is perfect, even at night. The little pools that are created when the tide is low are exquisite pools of warmth from which you can see anemone and see horses. It is just a beautiful place👍😃."
Kemoy C,40 contributions,Nov 2016,Warm waters.  Nice beach. I am a beach snob :) and from the Caribbean and have seen some gorgeous beaches. This was okay but nice. Clean beach. 
DrChandrakant,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2016,"A nice and clean beach where no one bothers you. Enjoy, relax and relax.  This is a must go place and an experience in itself.  In the free time, go to some of the select and high quality restaurants.  "
slwityk,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2016,Beautiful beach to stroll on especially in the morning or evening.  The beach goes for miles and with the pristine water to swim in is a must.
Pte_J0ker,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"A quite and reasonably nice beach, good if you want to just chill and take is the sun and a dip in the water or maybe try some beginners surfing or stand up paddle boarding."
SANJAYPATELDR,"Jamnagar, India",Nov 2016,"While the beach offers all sea activities , a special visit of  turtle island in a  glass bottom boat  is a must .Enjoy the beautiful corals on way , not only the turtles but so many birds and animals and quench your thirst  at the end with big big coconut water..."
Karen M,"Blantyre, UK",Nov 2016,"Without a doubt all the beaches in Bali are a gorgeous.Nusa Dua beach is stunning, water seems more calmer at the shore than Kuta. The beach is also very clean."
Tony,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Nusa Dua is ""the beach"" everyone tells you to visit in Bali, and yes it is nice but it is also covered in rubbish and has 100 hotels fronting onto it. Hey, that's Bali though."
Cristina_Dumitru,"Bucharest, Romania",Nov 2016,"Perfect for the ones staying in Nusa Dua beach resorts. Spectacular views, extremely hot water, plenty of corals and colorful fishes. Best for water sports."
SUBODHCAM,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,Best beach. Only for hotel guests. Superb view. Safe and hotel has provided bed on beach and chairs to relax
ClaudiaFDias,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2016,"Nice and calm. You have to try the massage at the Nusa Dua Beach. Very cheap if compared to hotel, and very good quality. Be nice with the sarong/clothes sales in the beach and they will be nice with you :)"
lluviagutierrez,"Avon, CO",Nov 2016,"its a nice beach very relaxing and quiet with nice resorts araound, it definitely needs some cleaning you find a lot of trash around. "
Katedrum,"Edmonton, Canada",Oct 2016,"It is sad to see how much garbage floats to this beach. Some hotels clean it up, some don't. I have heard this is also dependent on the season (tides). The scenery is beautiful though. It's worth going, but I suggest to be mindful and don't add to the pollution problem - respect our planet and put garbage where it belongs. "
Mustafa S,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Oct 2016,Good for a nice walk in the morning or evening. A good long stretch of sand. A lot better than Kuta beach. 
Nimish N,2 contributions,Nov 2016,"Beautiful Beaches, White Sand, Clear Water. Excited to see the Concerned Hotel staff keeps Beach clean, Plastic Free and Keep on Dressing the Sand..!"
LoveAtFirstSight13,"Washington Crossing, PA",Nov 2016,"I didn't like this beach at all. It was dirty, trash-filled and tons of water sports polluting the water and the air. Too loud too."
C555J,"Cape Town, South Africa",Nov 2016,"Into the 5th day of our stay...our resort is just footsteps away from this little bit of heaven.  Clean, white beautiful Nusa Dua beach...and what a pleasure to be able to say that you needn't worry about being interrupted by hawkers who are trying to fob their merchandise off on you! Perfectly clean...surrounding restaurants along the beach front offers a good variety of food at reasonable prices...highly recommend...& will definitely back in the near future!"
agusw281,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Feels so sad to learn that the beach not as sapcious as before when I live in Nusa Dua in 2000's. Peaople were often play soccer,  volley ball and  practicing jugling around the beach and grass area. Now those spacious ground are having a massive abrassion and I Think immediate action should be done to avoid bigger impact in the future."
matyabun,"Vilnius, Lithuania",Oct 2016,But still the Nusa Dua beach is not bad at all. Cleanness of water depends on oceans stream and daytime. Best time for swimming is early in the morning. Plenty of cafes and massage options on the beach.
ReshuTomar,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2016,"It is a very nice and clean and less people beach, mostly for the tourists from 5 star hotels which are abundant on the Nusa Dua beach. There are a lot of mangrove trees on the beach which caught my attention. I loved the park near the beach which has a huge Arjun and Krishna statue (i guess). We also spotted a very young komodo species there. A little market nearby, few shacks for drinks and shops for food. If you are not the guest of the hotels that are located on this beach then please be informed that you will not get a bed on the beach as they all belong to the hotels. But you can always sit on the chairs that belong to the shacks.Do explore the area near Nusa Dua beach, the theater, shopping mall and the beautifully kept roads."
BMDEE,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Bali. We only got to see it once - next time visit I think I will stay over this way. 
Penelope H,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Nov 2016,Wonderful sunrise setting in Bali for an early morning walk if you are staying in the middle of Nusa Dua 
LifeTravel96,"Puchong, Malaysia",Oct 2016,It's a nice beach and less congested. Clean and very nice for taking pics. It's a great experience to have dinner by this beach at night.
katie,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,"Visited here three years ago and there were still some areas for outsider i.e. People who don't stay in the luxury hotels within Nusa Dua. However when we went back this time, the entire beach is occupied by the hotel groups where you could only rent their beach chairs. Apart from renting the beach chairs, the ocean is nice and blue with clear water. "
Dedy I Santoso I,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,This beach is a private beach for BTDC members' or hotel's guest only. But mostly people who know this place will come directly and relaxing on the beach.Very excellent view and we enjoy day-time on the beach.But only 1 restroom for washing our body afther playing sand. Need more restroom.
Alexander R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,We stayed few times around nusa dua resort that have private acces to nusa dua beach and every time we came the beach were always clean.Recommended for those who wants a quite time and not crowded
Timmy T,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2016,The whole Nusa Dua beach area are basically controlled by the hotels/resorts and you are not allowed to even enjoy the sunshine while your own blanket. You will have to rent a beach chair from them which are of coz rather expensive.Anyways the blue ocean is worth the visit.
Rena G,"Nanjing, China",Sep 2016,"Very pretty - white sand, great ocean viewNice beach umbrellas for rent. Price wasn't too bad.Not that crowded compared to other popular beachesThere is a big shallow area with clear water and small fishiesNext to the beach was a park ish area where you can walk to a cliff - breath taking views there."
Denise Perkins,"Lismore, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach is reasonably pretty enough, but after coming from the east coast of Australia, we realised that we actually have nicer beaches close to home. They rake debris off the beach each morning. There are hawkers trying to sell you things and the footpath has been partly smashed away by (storms? sand erosion?)"
davieMar,"Tickton, UK",Oct 2016,A stunning beach. The tide lines are kept clean of seaweed by staff from the nearby hotels. There are very few people on the beach. Its a very long beach with shallow sandy sections and deeper areas but *Beware!* we found that there can be strong rip currents depending on the tides and wind direction. The tide times are posted on a boards belonging to hotels.
unnatural2u,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2016,Less people and a lot cleaner. Pay a visit to the water blow point (best time at noon or early morning).
Lloyd R,"Victoria, Canada",Oct 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is really nice. Not too many people but a great walkway along the Hotel row. The tide comes in and out a long way. I enjoy this area . It's very green and tropical. Give it a try
uwiee2512,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Away from crowded Kuta until Seminyak, we can happily spend good times in Nusa Dua beach. We really enjoy the beach"
Whizkid j,4 contributions,Nov 2016,"Not exceptional. But good for casual visitor. Lot of free chairs on the beach. Cleanliness 7/10. Always use UBER/Grab for transport. If you use the local transport in the area, they will rip you off 5X the uber rates. "
Sanjayshah912,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is lovely. Very clean, very inviting.Not very crowded. It is great for spending some leisurely time.Worth a visit."
Erin H,12 contributions,Nov 2016,The beach here is much cleaner than kuta beach.這裡的沙灘比庫塔漂亮，沙灘比起來比較白，這一區也比較沒有那麼的商業化，如果比起庫塔區的話，不會擠滿著出租海灘椅的小販纏著你。
mfarrags,Egypt,Nov 2016,1. The atmosphere was really good2. The water was full of rocks3. Good place to go4. Really enjoyed going there even more than kuta beach 
Lash0106,"Australind, Australia",Nov 2016,Stunning beaches-   clean and not too busy. Safe to swim in and very little beach selling. Much nicer than Kuta and Legian area beaches. 
sashena h,"Chicago, IL",Nov 2016,Absolutely great beach!! Clean water and sand!!! Was very pleasantly surprised at the beach quality - will definitely go back !! 
Rach C,4 contributions,Nov 2016,"This beach is really nice, very private. There are a few locals around asking if you would like a massage, to be honest they scared my children as they were in the bushes and just randomly spoke up. The waves are pretty strong, but very clean bridge. "
Karen P,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2016,"Having stayed in Bali previously I was impressed by beach at Nusa Dua, clean and beautiful.  Most hotels have security so not many touts. Easy access and good waves at times."
yogis26,pune,Nov 2016,this beach is quite clean compared to other beaches of Bali. The slope of beach is quite high making it dangerous for small kids but for adults it is great for swimming.
John M,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2016,"The hotels strictly control the touts and the cleanliness in front of their properties., otherwise the rubbish is noticeable. There are no lifeguards as such and you are advised to have footwear when swimming due to things that sting. The area is secure with a strong police presence."
FaddySue,"Kuching, Malaysia",Jan 2016,"We stopped at Nusa Dua beach on the first day of our Bali holiday for a bit of beach activity and water sport activity.Our tour bus took us to the end of Nusa Dua beach where there were many operators offering activities like scuba diving, jet skies, banana boat rides, underwater walking, water power jet etc. If you're looking for any type of water activity and sport, you'll find it here. Charges are pricey but what do expect when you go to such a tourist destination. Facilities; like changing room, toilet, lockers etc., are available but not exactly the best. A word of caution, keep your valuables e.g. cameras and hand phones locked in your tour bus, it's safer.We found the beach very crowded as literally all tourists come here just about to enjoy some water sports. We felt it wasn't safe as you get speedboats criss crossing among the banana boat rides and the jet skiers. Not sure if the operators have a safety guide when operating the various rides. Due to the excessive crowds, the beach is not that clean as a result. But you're looking for a bit of beach fun in Bali, then this the place to go. "
Ratna K,1 contribution,Sep 2016,"this place is beautiful with clean beach and Sunday market in the and of the month, also many restaurant."
zipconiac,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"It has everything that called pleasure. White sand beach with no trash. Low med waves so it make ur 5 yrs old children can play with.You can pamper urself with hand massage. 100k rp for 30 minutes, or maybe it need extra cash if you foreigner. I dont know why this discrimination exist, maybe foreigner have bigger body :)"
AussieKandA,Western Australia,Oct 2016,Beach had a fair amount of plastic garbage on the high water mark. The rest of the beach was clean and well maintained.
Ana T,"Muscat, Oman",Dec 2015,"Clean and crystal clear water, a perfect place for water sports such as jet skiing. Perfect for kids as well :)"
jigneshad,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2016,One of the cleanest beach in Indonesia. Lot of water sports activities keeps you busy throughout the day.
neelmap,"Panjim, India",Nov 2015,"Serene, peaceful, calm would be the only words to describe Nusa Dua beach in bali. Lovely watersports. had a great time."
ClaireBeeNYC,"New York City, NY",Oct 2016,"Very pretty, clean beach. Many people are here so it could be crowded. But I would def say it's top 10 in Bali."
sundara,Bombay,Oct 2016,"The sea is clean and inviting, not more than waist deep till about 10  metres from the shore, very mild waves making it a nice place to swim"
paddy13191,"Gold Coast Hinterland, Australia",Oct 2016,We stayed at Nusa Dua for 7 nights and were on the beach everyday. It is a very good beach but could be cleaner. The resorts have beach cleaners there everyday but they never were able to keep up with it. We went swimming everyday and there was always some rubbish in the water or on the beach. 
Kellyann1075,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"The Nusa Dua beach is a gorgeous white sand beach with plenty of water sports. It is safe for children to swim however there are a few hawkers around (not unusual for Bali). Lots and lots of weddings when we were there, seemed a little bit like a 'one size fits all' approach to weddings with couple after couple trekking down the pier for photos. That said, it was entertaining to sit and watch after recently getting married at the unique and quiet Komune resort. Loved the beach however and would defiantly recommend a visit."
Andrew B,Darlinghurst,Oct 2016,Quiet peaceful hot but gentle breeze service if you just lift your head. A perfect place to do nothing but just relax and get a great tan just hop skip and jump from any of the fabulous resorts that touch this amazing beach. The ocean is calm protected by a reef perfect for water sports and swimming 😎😎😎
Lucykeebs,"Essex, UK",Aug 2016,"Absolutely gorgeous, I felt like I was in paradise! However it is also the most expensive place I visited, a bottle of water cost £4 and in Bali that is an extortionate price, even in England it would be! "
taryn81,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,This was our first Nusa Dua experience and we were pleasantly surprised. The pathway along the beach that winds around all the beautiful restaurants and resorts was perfect for us. We also loved the quiet nature of nusa dua. There is not many people really hassling you to buy things and the ones that are there along the beach have a lovely manner. There is also a big security presence which adds to the feeling of safeness.The actual Nusa Dua beach water is a disappointment as it is quite dirty but everything else makes up for it😄
Tamsin v,"Durban, South Africa",Oct 2016,"Amazing! We stayed at Club Med and spent plenty time on the beach! Snorkelling, windsurfing, jetskiing and parasailing. Great walk along the beach past all the hotels."
medewiforever,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"The Mercure Bali Nusa Dua, transport you  to the beach. They have a section under the trees just for guests of the Hotel. Its a lovely area. The water is beautiful. It is a very pleasant area to visit. "
LeanneJ721,"Hobart, Australia",Oct 2016,The beach is used for entry to water sports and where I was all the accommodation was right on the beach but the beach itself was very covered in seaweed and not very clean looking. Hotels had pools.
LilysMum0723,"Clinton, WA",Sep 2016,"Loved this experience, sands are beautiful lovely beach and water is so warm.  Paradise and more, nothing short of amazing"
pjworldtravel,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2016,"Secluded, peaceful, calm would be the words to describe nusa dua beach. Having said that, its not really that secluded, there are lot of tourists, but a different group of crowd. This part is slightly upscale side. No much hawkers or groups of guys etc. And it is pretty safe too. There is lot of nice sand shore. Its better to stay in resorts around nusa dua if someone wants to really enjoy. There are water sports activities too. Waves are not that strong because of corals. Its safe to get into water and play even with small kids. For swimming one need to check the tides and water level. Need to know which parts have corals to avoid swimming those areas.Overall this is a beach to relax. For partying you need to go to other areas like kuta and seminyak."
Christine Paterson,"Scotland, UK",Oct 2016,Lovely clean beach. Some of the hotels should take more pride in there part of the beach thou. Our hotel had it cleaned every day at Inaya Putri. 
tanasha_farhan,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2016,Wow must see clean neat and more relaxing after long some tiring day you can sit at the beach relax and and enjoy
Imraan_000,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Oct 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is the best beach in Bali.Clean and private. Be aware of which hotel you book as some strips are better than others.
Mark W,"Basildon, UK",Oct 2016,"First place wanted about 2 million to do both git them down to one then failed the medical they don't like diabetes type 2 for some reason anyhoe went down the road paid 1.2 million and went straight to induction lol no medical so you can slash prices massively if you ask !! Sea walker is ok but the pressure build up does get to you when you go down further it's not deep but it's uncomfortable but good, snorkelling is snorkelling the people are all nice and chilled just don't pay the price on the sheet !!!!!! Sorry it's a pic of me only had two lol but that's the wet suit you get "
637juneg,"Tumbi Umbi, Australia",Oct 2016,"The beach was lovely with white sand and shade from trees, great place to read your book until being interrupted by people selling things. Hard to communicate that I only had my towel glasses and book with me,  no money. I had to promise to come back tomorrow for them to leave. There was also quiet a bit of rubbish on waters edge, plastic bottles and wrappers that had been washed up. I didn't actually swim there."
Nouzab,"Viti Levu, Fiji",Oct 2016,A great beach to hang out but the not the best for swimming. Lot of food outlets as well as bars. Very important for o do morning as well as after sunset walks.
Loum613,Connecticut,Oct 2016,"The beach is fronted in some areas by a reef which keeps wave activity controlled. Be sure to visit the ""water blow"". Some of the walkway areas in the more public area where washed away by the last Cyclone, but still ok to walk. Also an easy beack walk to The Collection shops, with nice restaurants and shopping."
NinaKrohn,"Taipei, Taiwan",Oct 2016,We spent almost a week at this beach and we loved every minute of it! We are looking forward to coming back next year!
sirmapetrova,"Varna, Bulgaria",Apr 2016,The beach is really beautiful. I love to walk around. It is really romantic. There are women who sells different interesting things. You can enjoy a four hands massage there. It is awesome.
Travel Bug,"Canton of Zurich, Switzerland",Oct 2016,"Ok Beach but some trash in water and on the beach like plastic bags, wrappers etc. It is fun to walk out on to the little peninsula with temple on it."
A forever explorer,"Samford, Australia",Oct 2016,We love Nusa Dua and choose to stay here as its lots quieter and pretty and clean. The front of beach all the resorts link up and its just beautiful to walk along. You feel very very safe and no one hassles you on the beach as its all private. However particularly towards the benoa end its  ery average beach.flat calm but shallow and at low tide turns into long sand flats. Towards the hilton the beach is much better. To catch cab to kuta is about 10 dollars to 15 dollars.
196A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"Located near to Nusa Dua hotel complex, this is a quiet and beautiful beach compared to Kuta. Not like other beach with high waves, this beach is great for family with kids."
shah,Wales,Oct 2016,"We atayed at the Hyatt, beach was nice quiet and clean ,sea looked clean and was nice and warm. It stretches across a few resorts "
DarreninHK,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2016,"Backed by luxury hotels, this is a great beach, with penty of places to eat and drink, or to have fun. However, as all the hotels are expensive, expect everyting to be pricy."
Thomas O,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2016,Very clean & Clear water beach with not so huge tide..Very well maintained. Some companies like Thirtha Harum operate water sports.    
Carey,"Taunton, UK",Oct 2016,"Beach was kept clean by the beach cleaners, though they buried the rubbish, rather than taking it away, at high tide it's a lovely beach, and low tide though slightly disappointing"
TrishAdrian,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,The beach in front of the Westin resort was a beach not to forget We loved alternating between our pool and the beach! It was always clean and a real treat to swim in but also enjoy the walk along side it.We loved sipping cocktails at any one of the resorts whilst sitting on the beach!Some nights at the Westin resort they had a dj playing very cool chilled out music which really set the mood. 
Mankj65,19 contributions,Dec 2015,White sand beach with clear water. Good for jogging track. the wave is not so big and perfect for swiming on the beach. On sunday afternoon Will more crowded with local people. But nice can see how to know the balinese people activity.
markbeck89,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2016,"It is beautiful and clean. Everybody can spend a beautiful time here. Although I didn't try any water sport, but I could see how the people were satisfied with those amazing experience. "
Elisa_unterwegs,"Moneglia, Italy",Oct 2016,Nice beach but in my opinion not the best of Bukit. Honestly i prefer the beaches in the area of ulu watu.
Yurong,Singapore,Oct 2016,clean and nice beach in front of luxury hotels. minimal spending is more compared to other beaches but less tourists along the same stretch so it's more quiet. 
tousax737,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach was amazing. The sand was white, the water was clear and it wasn't crowded. Hardly any hawkers trying to sell us things and it really made a difference. More amenities could be good such as public toilets etc, but other than that I cant fault this beach. amazing"
Ian M,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2016,"We visited during the 'shoulder' season for tourists, expecting very little activity. But, we were very wrong. Lots of action with glass bottom boats, paragliding, banana boats and much more. There was still space to relax on the beach as well."
Sunny M,Sweden,Oct 2016,we have been there just a day trip was really nice and clean beach and good for water sports the people like water sports will like that place a lot of restaurant and hotels there good view and so clear water 
Stephanie Smailes,26 contributions,Oct 2016,"Beautiful beach! Suitable for swimming. Great massage place between Lagoona and Inaya Putri - 200,000 rupiahs for 1 hour and 2 masseuses!"
Sanath Kumar,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2016,"The best beach in south Bali.. Has water sport activities and also secret coves, where one can spend time with loved ones.. Very clear water and shallow for the kids as well. Could get dirty at times when the waves wash up the weeds.. "
Em P,"Prague, Czech Republic",Oct 2016,"At low tide this beach is full of rubbish, water stale and not super clean. I can imagine, though, that on high tide it is a gem. Beautiful, long, sandy, with pretty little peninsulas on each corner. We went to the stripe called Melia or Pirates bay and in between that and pantai Samuh there is a magical little peninsula. Explore it a bit for beautiful cliffs from other side, if you swim around on the sea level, there is gorgeous tiny hidden beach, also lot of corals for snorkelling. The beach surroundings are only being in construction (like concrete path I mean), so there is no fee (might be in future when they make it better). Restaurants not the cheapest, if you travel on budget, bring your own snack and drink.It was not very crowded, more locals than tourists, and there were few spots where to find shade which is always great bonus ;)"
Rouge_fairy,"Makati, Philippines",Oct 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is quiet and picturesque but that's all. Lots of seaweed, and sharp rocks at the bottom and the beach stench in late afternoon is almost unbearable. The waves are really strong too it's hard to enjoy swimming. "
YingChang,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2016,Went during low tide .... could walk a long stretch before the dropoff. Water is clear and warm !Good for an early morning n evening dip.
Turabali M,40 contributions,Aug 2016,Our hotel was on this beach. A long stretch of beautiful white sandy beach warm waters great waves and choice of activities 
Emil J,1 contribution,Oct 2016,"The late afternoon sun shining on the white sand to spoil the eye, it was an amazing sight.Wonderful Indonesia"
davidtamlyn,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2016,"Its a Beach. Clean, sand a bit gritty, Locals are surfing and swimming so must be safe. Occupied by mainly hotels."
Sandy A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"it is recommended if you decide to swim, the beach and the sands are clean. jogging would be ok while breathing fresh air from the sea"
AUvWorld,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2016,Not the best swimming or surfing beach - but good for a sunbathe and a walk around the many hotels along the beach
Nilesh A,10 contributions,Aug 2016,An ideal place for water activity in bali... really loved the place and all rides.Rides are totally safe and under professional guidance.
Dennis T,"Sligo, Ireland",Oct 2016,"Was taken by our driver to the most northern point of Nusa Dua. Great stretch of the beach, all taken by boats jetskies, them other parachute-paraglide-parasomethings. Definitely your choice for any kimd of boat trip. Trips to Turtle Island go from there, too (cheapest from hundreds of offers was around 250k local money).We were still in the searchfor a place to swim - this one is a big NO, so we moved further south. Next stop - Waterblow.2 beaches just north of it, small peninsula itself and massive beach to the south.Views are breathtaking. But - cant really swim, too shallow. "
El Liron Salvaje,Bucharest,Oct 2016,"It's a quite long stretch of sand, pretty quiet beach, some (small) areas are reserved by hotels in Nusa Dua, meaning they have sunbeds for their guests, but otherwise it's a free pass for everyone, including merchants.If you don't go near the rocks, there's not much to see in the water. At one end of the beach, there's a nice park, guarded by the huge statues of Rama and Laksmana. From this park you have the access path to the Water Blow.I believe towards the other end (opposite from the park) you can do some water sports. All in all it's nice and clean.Stay in the shade during dangerous hours (around 12-2pm) as the sun can burn you really bad."
Deborah,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,Fantastic white sands beautiful clear water couldn't ask for more. Could have stayed on this beach for days all within easy distance to restaurants and other resorts
320quc,8 contributions,Oct 2016,"I went in the morning. The beach is clean and quiet.There is a well built park beside, suitable for cycling or jogging. "
PinnacleTravel88,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is a beautiful peaceful beach. The beach is also where most of the big name hotels are located. Sunset is beautiful and during the day is not too crowded
Barsukolga,"Moscow, Russia",Oct 2016,"Second time in nusa dua and sea runs away from me:( Not sure if there is seasonal problem, but I preferred to enjoy swimming in the sea during my holidays"
Thomas Patrick Christensen,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Oct 2016,The beach is long and has lovely white sand and turquoise water. There is a reef about half a Mile out to sea so most of the big waves are dampened down by the time they are near to the shaw. There are lots of water sports and restaurants along the beach with some cheap lunchtime delights on offer. 
CyrusKM101,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2016,"If you are into nightlife and lots of shopping, then do not go to Nusa Dua. The hotels are mostly resort style and away from one another"
Teemu L,"Helsinki, Finland",Aug 2016,"Good clean beach, but swimming is not recommended because of the tides, they great strong currents and water level changes rapidly from morning to evening. For just fast splashes OK, for swimming not so much. Best for tanning or massages. Very good beach walk."
Anna-Maria_Kets,"Offenbach, Germany",Oct 2016,We went there and stayed for a few hours. The beach is very long and mostly clean. Some parts have sea weeds inside.  There are not so many waves so it is suitable for non swimmers. 
katrien420,"Antwerp, Belgium",Sep 2016,Very natural and amazing beach with lots of colors in the water where you can have a quiet swim. The big waves are far away in the sea. Sometimes you can do some snorkeling. Amazing views to the sea from a cliff.
Jazz657,"London, UK",Oct 2016,We are staying at one of the hotels on the beachfront and we have exclusive access to one part of the beach. its a beautiful beach and very quiet and peaceful. White sand and blue water!
abuyukkezer,"Istanbul, Turkey",Oct 2016,Very nice and clean beach . There is some recognizable tide during day. In afternoons you can snorkelling . Very nice underwater view.
anamorar8,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"beautiful beach with clean water and yellow sand , very peaceful .good to swim too as the water tend to be calmer then in other parts of bali "
Sam,"Weymouth, UK",Oct 2016,"We only visited here, we opted against staying here as we wanted to really experience Bali and its culture and this is just full of luxury resorts. However, we would return to Bali and stay here now that we have experienced 'real' Bali. The entire area is landscaped so beautifully, it is maintained to the highest standard and the beaches are second to none with their white sand and incredibly turquoise water. The whole of a Nusa Dua is beautiful!"
RMHMT,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,A short walk or jog from resort hotels. Not crowded and beautiful to walk along in the early morning.
hsinclair90,"Secret Harbour, Australia",Sep 2016,Lovely beach filled with many bars and cafes along the waterfront. Definitely worth an afternoon stroll! 
robertsK5211MM,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"Amazing beach, privacy from stall sellers great. Security is excellent and there are usually plenty of lounges to be had. The beach is cleaned regularly and the water is very clean."
June H,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,It was the 3rd time that I stayed at this hotel  and it just keeps getting better. Staff and facilities are excellent and nothing is too much trouble. Food is to die for. my name is George Hondris my wife June & I came back for the 3rd visit and loved it. We will be back.
Indy D,26 contributions,Sep 2016,"If your staying in Nusa Dua, dont give it a miss. You will walk past this beach on the way to Waterblow and youll probably want to stay here for a while too!"
IncognitoElias,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Sep 2016,Nusa Dua beach is an almost private beach. It is one of the cleanest private beach My wife and I have ever come across.
Mike R,"Woolavington, UK",Sep 2016,"This is a fantastic venue, it's September the water is 26c, at low tide you can walk out 100 metres. Walk for miles on beautiful sand, plenty of cover under palm and other trees. Call at the many 5 star hotels for a refreshing beer or coffee. Safe at anytime of day. "
OneTrueWanderer,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jul 2016,"Clean, scenic and without big waves except high tide, this is a perfect place to start ones day and enjoy couple of other water sports with family. The absence of big waves means, one can enjoy over a greater area with knee length water for longer time. Absence of big waves also reduces danger and eye burning sensation. So while extreme water sport enthusiast might be disappointed, the families would enjoy the place much more than most other beaches. Recommended to stay in one of the resorts on beach for awesome holiday so one can use amenities. Lastly beach is clean, well maintained and offers excellent view without much outside crowd apart from hotels."
Alfina C,13 contributions,Sep 2016,"Its great when the tides in, peaceful & clean.The staff at the Grand Hyatt even sweep the beach regularly & no problems with the hawkers, just say no thanks & they move on.  "
natalialee555,"French Riviera - Cote d'Azur, France",Feb 2016,"Watching the sunset is quite beautiful!�. Also the buzz of people communicating, the traders bartering, the music is all amazing!"
lovesweets2,"Avalon Beach, Australia",Sep 2016,"We are staying at The Mulia and have access to Geger beach but was told this beach is great for snorkelling. Our taxi driver drove us on a public road next to club med. from there, it was a short walk to the beach. There are diving pontoon close to club med. down there there are a lot of tropical fishes. It's quite deep but ok to snorkel. Highly recommend. Beach is nice and clean. "
Krisley,"Tarlac, Philippines",Sep 2016,"If you want to spend a day in the beach in convenience then this is the best place for you. You get a nice shoreline, clear water, and hotels/restaurants in walking distance. "
ninhursag,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,Nusa Dua is basically a gated community. A number of hotels are there including Club Med. The beach is kept very clean and tidy and is a great place to relax and take the kids.
amit265,"Indore, India",Jul 2016,"me and my friend went to explore the restaurants located along the side of Nusa Dua beach and we were amazed to see so many good 5 star properties having their restaurants along the beach side. The beach stretch is excelllent giving a good view. Its good to sit in one of these restaurants and enjoy the breeze, music with some drinks and good company"
Anand1351,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"We stayed in Nusa Dua hotel and explored the beach line there and were impressed.Waves are not strong and you can swim, the best stretch is in front of Nusa Dua hotel, crystal clear blue water, nice for a stroll in evening and morning infact anytime I would say."
AmarnathKamath,"Bengaluru, India",Sep 2016,"Went to the beach in the morning. No crowds, nice clean sand. Peaceful place away from the crowds. Unlike the other beaches. "
Rebecca D,"Mareeba, Australia",Sep 2016,Kicked back with friends. Not accosted by local sellers too often. Very clean. Security at either end and patrols so felt very safe. Tour boats leave right from the beach. 
Piyumi G,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Sep 2016,I visited Nusa Dua beach on evenings with my husband during our stay in Bali. The beach is nice and clean. The water looked beautiful. There was an average crowd in the beach and it was not overcrowded. We loved the beauty of the blue waters and the beautiful beach. Lots of people swam and water was not rough.We had a lovely experience there. I definitely recommend this beach over other overcrowded and polluted beaches like Kuta beach.
Anky99,"Houston, TX",Feb 2016,This is the only private beach in Nusa dua and you can access this beach only if you stay in one of the hotels at this beach.Really peaceful and one of the cleanest beach. If you are expedting crystal blue waters.. this is not the place but still one of the best beach in Bali is what i would say!
Julian S,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Sep 2016,We stayed at Kayumanis private Villa and had a short stroll to the beach. The beach near our accommodation and many others was a surprise. The tide goes out exposing what are essentially mud flats. When the tide is in there are no waves which is good and bad. We did see another part of the beach around the corner near the St Regis hotel (where we had dinner). This water apparently does not disappear at low tide so consider accommodation  near here if you love a white sand with water there 24/7
Moser222,"Aarhus, Denmark",Sep 2016,Very beautiful area. White and very good for swimming at high tide. Sadly a tad too much garbage in the water at times though.
Natasha S,"Newton Abbot, UK",Sep 2016,"We went to the public beach for a visit and there was just so much rubbish floating around that day it was sad..it felt very 'resort-y' in this area which wasn't really our thing, although I can imagine the hotels are lovely. I can imagine it could be very nice at this beach but it was ruined by swimming around with plastic."
XCSGMC,"Nieuwegein, The Netherlands",Sep 2016,"The water here is beautiful and quite, perfect for swimming. We loved this side of Bali. There is a lot to do here."
Khaled Hussein,"Tripoli, Lebanon",Sep 2016,Large beach with superb view and water. Always clean. Many staff come everyday to clean the beach from what the sea bring at night time. Very secure. Wonderful trees making shadow on very natural environment.
alamo07109,Amman,Sep 2016,"We stayed at Nusa Dua beach hotel, right on the beach. The beach is clean, lots of space to relax and lounge around. Water is not deep at all which is good for children. Definitely a great place to visit while in Bali."
Kim A,36 contributions,Oct 2015,"The water is clear and calm. More quiet that Kuta beach. However, it wasn't what I was really expecting from Nusa Dua as compared to the beach in Philippines  like Coron or El Nido, Palawan. "
Tiago J,44 contributions,Sep 2016,"This is one of the most nice beaches in Bali, fit for children and adult looking for some rest and swiming. "
MrsA-M-L-B,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2016,"the beach was beautiful,  water was clean,  and there is so much to do along the entire waterfront area, with restaurants, bars, music and massages,  i will def be going back "
ESalvador,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Sep 2016,"Rented 2 beach benches at 200,000 rupiah for 3 hours in a public beach, and enjoyed the beach with my family. Shallow waters were ideal for young kids, but walking  bit further and you are in ""surfing"" part of the beach. Public toilet available, 2000 rupiah to use and lots of food kiosk.Lots of sunshine, not many people and water was nice. Great time."
HunterCleo,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is one of well known beach in South Bali. The beach is clean and well organised with local management. Near here you can find tourist attraction named Waterblow. The beach usually full on public holiday.
RobG-Sydney,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Had a great stay at Awarta Nusa Dua Luxury Villas and Spa. Loved the private pool and gazebo area. Room was spacious and always cleaned to a high standard. Staff and management were very friendly and accomodating and went out of their way to help us find other places and activities. Food was also excellent, large choice for breakfast and room service was always prompt. Spa was also a very high standard, very clean and hygienic and masseuses were experts with great technique. Was a very relaxing and enjoyable time. Totally enjoyed the stay, would definitely recommend it!"
Gaye B,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"good surf ,  clean sand  good for walk buy something from the ladies selling their many bags of colourful sarongs dresses "
Rama A,10 contributions,Sep 2016,"I visited the Nusa Dua Beach during my stay at the Sofitel in Nusa Dua. There was a dedicated Sofitel beach area which was quiet nice. The atmosphere in general is rather relaxed and less populated with locals like the Kuta/ Legion beaches. I would recommend a visit to the beach if you prefer a cleaner and quieter experience. Plenty of water sports and activities available if thats what you're looking to do. Also this beach is relaxing for swim because there is no big wave. This beach also has bits of corals and stones,,,"
Zoran H,40 contributions,Sep 2016,Nice beach and refreshing to swim in - swim out past the reef and you will be within some big waves. At shore the waves are a trickle.
Andrew Gary K,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"the beach was kept extremely clean as workers continued all day raking & burying the seeweed, also physically removing the rubbish that washed up on shore. had a little bit of a surf but mainly just a paddle as wrong time of year for good swell"
55khz,Melbourne,Sep 2016,For an Asian beach it was relatively clean and clear water and sand. I spent most of my time around the Hyatt and it's really pleasant. There is a rip and if you're not a strong swimmer don't go far offshore. There's not really any rocks either where I was. 
Rod R,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Very nice beach for a walk, not that busy & the water is warm & calm, you can kayak or surf if you wish, no paragliding though, thank goodness"
SJC1957,"Cheshire, UK",Sep 2016,"The sea can be a little rough and you need to take care when swimming. Wearing water shoes is recommended as there can be sea urchins , we did see a couple of jelly fish. There is also bits of coral and stones in places so you need to be careful. Each hotel has sun beds available , there are locals selling kites,jewellery and the usual sarongs. They are all very good natured and usually accept ""no thank you"" eventually with a smile. They all wear t shirts with numbers on so its easy to recognise them. At one end of the beach you can walk across to a small island (when the tide is out) and see a lovely temple and super coastal views. Well worth a visit. Be very careful and don't try and swim across in the high tide unless you are a confident swimmer, you can suddenly feel as though you are being swept away. The beach is always being swept so is nice and clean. I think the beach is very popular for Wedding photos, we lost count of the bride and grooms having their photos taken. It was nice to see them in all their lovely wedding outfits on the beach."
MVarma,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"A lot of floating rubbish that some hotels (ayodya) chose the fury rather then pick up, the hotel beach clubs are nice, but the ocean has a strong current so be careful"
Mabel D,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2016,This is one of the best beaches in Bali. Quiet and less tourists around. The blue water & white sands are simply mesmerizing. Good for relaxing. 
Amish Mehta,"Vadodara, India",Sep 2016,The sports are fun. Very clean and good options for rides. My kid enjoyed a lot. There is nothing untoward to report on this location. everything is super best.
badmooie,"Milan, MI",Aug 2016,Too many jet skis but one of the most beautiful ocean views on the planet. Lots of pools and areas for snorkeling. I would like to see worldwide boycott against jet skis and noise maker boats near swimming beaches. They are a hazard and should e kept well off shore
YHN-ID,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"It's beautiful beach .. white sand near beach there are jogging track a lot people bring their dog there in the afternoon .. just be careful with any person who bring dogs there .. it's very often the dog will fight .. they are not bring small cute little dog type .. they are bring pitbull or bigger dog there and one thing i dont like of them ,they're let their dog to pup anywhere they want .. they don't have awareness to keep environment clean. Just open your eyes more when you walking in all thw way to the park ,the jogging track and the grass area. About the beach it was my favourite place actually .. like the sand and tree .. so you can sit and watch the wave and see the horizon .. BUT unfortunatelly some place of this place is not for public .. but its Private beach of the hotel.. if you stay in the hotel around here than you can sit and relax without worrying the hotel security approching to ask you out from the area..."
FiveVe,"Gravesend, UK",Aug 2016,Went to this beach when stayed at Nusa Dua hotel. The beach were cleaner and better view compared to Kuta beach.Good restaurants and shopping mall were within the walking distance from the beach.
vova o,6 contributions,Sep 2016,Perfectly maintained beachfront. Great for swimming at high tides. Clean and quiet. Peaceful place and friendly staff/ trinket sellers. 
azah A,Penang,Sep 2016,A place you should visit in Nusa Dua. There are another two in Kuta but i never had a chance to go. I will comw bacj
Tina G,Italy,Sep 2016,"In some reviews I have read, that this beach is discusting dirty etc. I gaven't found it sooo dirty. The dirt what was laying around was mostly seaweed (if it's too much than there is most likely a polution issue) and plastic bottles and cups. Please guess who throws them away whereever they are? Tourists probably?! I think so, I have seen it! So please stop complaining about a dirty beach if you are throwing away plastic bottles. If you want to do smth to help Bali to manage all the garbage issue please visit R.O.L.E. Fundations (it's also on TripAdvisor).By the way, you can swim there and there is plenty of space to lay down. I have seen several Balinese people cleaning up the beach. As I have written in the title: it could be better, yes! But it could also be a lot worse! "
Sumaiyya  L,London,Sep 2016,Hotel maintained strips are the best here. Lovely white sand and clear water. Wish I spent more time here 
Paul M,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2016,"We used the public area of Nusa Dua beach.  We hired two comfortable padded loungers with a small side table for only 150,000IR for the full day.Numerous places immediately behind beach areas for food and cold drinks - very reasonably priced.Beach is reasonable, golden sands with a very shallow area stretching out across the bay for a good couple of hundred metres out to sea.  Must be protected by a reef as very calm area. Lots of water sports going on but bathing area is roped off for safety.Decent option for a beach day, with Bali Collection shopping mall a few hundred yards away."
Chaïmae A,122 contributions,Sep 2016,We loved spending time in nusa dua having fruit juice and chili corn... the watter is clean and sand as well... go go you will lo ve it
DANAH,Kuwait,Sep 2016,the wather is nice the waves are sooo bige the bech was clean but full of see weeds the bech is divaided  to part eatch hotel gets a said with chairs if you are thinking of spending the day thire bring along swiming or diving shoose becous thire is some roks in the see but ober all its very nice 
worldcitizenPerth,"South Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and the beach opposite and on either side of the hotel as far as we walked is clean and with few touts and hawkers.  It is a beach for lying on and soaking up the sun.On the other hand, it is hardly worth getting into the sea.  The sea bed is only one to three feet below the surface all the way out to the reef about 250 metres out, and is covered in weed.  It does not invite any frolicking in the water.  You can, if you wish, find a weed-free 5 to 10 square metre patch and just lie in it."
shafeenan,"Guildford, UK",Aug 2016,"Beaches around Bali really are among the best in the world. The Nusa Dua coastline is no exception and a great place for those who like trawling for pretty bits of broken coral, or just walking for miles and miles along the shoreline. The tides are quite varied, offering an opportunity to walk out quite far at low tide but on a falling tide, the undertow is quite strong, particularly for children. If you like bartering, traders wander the sands with everything from glorious kites to pareos."
Lis,"Ramsgate, UK",Sep 2016,"This beach is just so beautiful.  The water lovely and warm but it is September and hot.  I was surprised that it wasn't too crowded and still quiet.  We stayed at the Laguna so perfect for us as so close to the pools and bars of our hotel.  Safe for swimmers with lifeguards on site, not too deep or roughy.  I like how the sand isn't too fine so doesn't stick to you! "
Lodko,167 contributions,Sep 2016,"We enjoyed this beach during our say at Club Med Sept 2016.The whole beach is well kept and seeming clean. There was a couple bits of rubbish in the water, but both the water and sand was extremely clean.Something to keep in mind is the large amount of tidal movement, if you visit in the after you won't be able to swim due to very low tides. Generally, 10am to 1pm is the best swimming time.So thing to be aware of this the possibility of sand lice/flea's. One day I got very badly bitten by sand lice/flea's. This results in a red bump like rash around areas the tiny shrimp like creates get caught in swim my tops and shorts. The rash lasts for a couple of days can is very itchy! Apparently they are more likely during times of higher amounts of seaweed and temperature. You can google it for more info, it's just something to be aware of.To be honest, I did not visit the beach again after this incident.Apart of that, there was nothing particular nasty in the water, no jellyfish or other stinging / overly dangerous animals.The area in front of Club Med also seems to be a popular fishing spot during low tide."
Sara K,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"A fabulous beach!  If the tide is up there is the opportunity for lots of water sports as well as playing in the sand which is still there.  When the tide is low, the shallows are wonderful for relaxing in and there are lots of rockpools to explore.  Wildlife is super!"
dhend85,"Newcastle, Australia",Sep 2016,"Nice clean beach but you have to go at the right tide, low tide exposes a lot of rocks and peak high tide creates strong rips on the northern side"
David P,15 contributions,Aug 2016,Clean and clear water! easy to swim even with crutches.one of the  Better beaches in Bali. Hope to come back soon!
mistermagoo2222,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"Our first trip here....Went snorkelling and did turtle island today with wife and 2 kids 7&9....Firstly reminded me of Kuta shopping strip with the vultures hovering... We booked a snorkel and turtle island...I have dived before so when they gave my kids masks that did not fit I had to step in and make sure they were going to keep changing them until they did... Same as mine....We jumped on a boat( just seaworthy).. The day was average( a little windy) but we didn't know better... After driving through the pandemonium he stopped us over a couple of rock... The daughter was sick, the wife was sick.. After we stopped he gave us life jackets....perplexing... They were for swimming.... We jumped over in the middle of a flotilla of boats ... Saw very little... A few little fish swimming around the rocks, grey coral.. Or what seemed to be coral...He told us we were spending an hour here... Ten minutes later I was done and over the chop...Turtle island was better, people there friendly ... Felt like turtles were in areas too small but what do I know...Coming home was ok till the driver beach the boat and nearly capsized us.. I got out and tried to get the kids out... Got the youngest out then the boat got slammed by a wave causing wife and daughter to get slammed inside the boat.. I got them out as quick as I could before the next wave slammed the boat ...We take safety very seriously in Aus for a reason .....Just be aware that in this country no matter how nice they are do not take safety anywhere even remotely seriously as we do..."
SamanthaNichole,"Baton Rouge, LA",Sep 2016,"A nice, clean swimming beach! Keep an eye out for fast currents, while the low tide water levels are a bit disappointing. "
LA C,27 contributions,Nov 2015,"Wife and I had our wedding on nusa dua beach! Absolutely wonderful! Clear and pristine water, clean and white sand covering the beach! "
ENES86,Idaho,Sep 2016,There are other places on the island that are better but this is easiest to access! Beach is lined with Resorts
VictorTHH,"Hong Kong, China",Aug 2016,"A very beautiful and quiet beach with no major water activity, so you can enjoy some good quiet beach time here."
Dameon G,"Mount Vernon, NY",Aug 2016,This beach was amazing nice white sand and beautiful location. Every hotel has the own private section to lounge on the beach. I stayed at the Amarterra Hotel. The beach is also public you just need to bring your own blanket if you're not staying in a nearby hotel.
M R,14 contributions,Sep 2016,"The first time I'm staying in a 5 Star Hotel with strong baldness properties inside and we'll maintainance. The food was good, the restaurants are nice as well as the great service in the Tamarind Restaurant. You should come and try. Cheers"
Musleh S,Saudi Arabia,Aug 2016,Nusa Dua beach is really nice and got nice view. It is not too crowded and great for swimming or laying on sands. It has trees nearby if it gets hot mid day where you can get shadow.
David E,24 contributions,Aug 2016,"Stayed in one of the resorts facing onto the beach, the beach is wide and expansive, water is safe to swim in.If you are not a guest at one of the resorts you will have to pay to hire a beach bed for the day.Be warned that there are sellers walking up and down all day selling goods and water sport activities.Drinks from the resorts are very expensive,"
Kriti R,India,Jan 2016,"Stunning beach with clear water. the beach is lined with hotels, their landscape areas add beauty to the beach. a great experience to walk along the peaceful beach during sunset."
mirtamay,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Aug 2016,"I loved the beach in Nusa Dua, really enjoyed the sunrises there it's absolutely mind blowing. The color of water is unbelievably beautiful. "
travellor194,"Panjim, India",Sep 2015,"very clean beach,crowded,very peaceful to spend your day and have a drink.lots of water activities can be done here."
joonee,Asia,Aug 2016,"Clean, beautiful beach to spend a whole day. Water is so blue and clear. A lot less crowded here as well."
Robert K,"Rockhampton, Australia",Aug 2016,Nusa Dua beach was a pleasant place to visit lots of places to eat and relax not the cheapest place to either eat or drink in Bali. The beach was nice to walk along however very shallow and lots of coral to cut your feet. I also did not find it very clean and was annoyed by the vendors constantly harassing you to buy their goods.
Travel.Stories.People,"Woodinville, WA",Aug 2016,Nusa Dua beach was great because of the following reasons:1. The beach was clean.2. The beach was not very crowded.3. Bathrooms were clean (paid).4. Sand on the beach was great.5. Hike to the ledge was fun.6. Surrounding park has great statue.Would definitely go back to this beach again.
AnaBee,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"I'm glad we chose to stay at one of the hotels along the Nusa Dua beach, because even though the water did feel a bit frothy and dirty with lots of bits of plastic rubbish floating about, I suspect it is still much better than the more crowded public beaches such as Kuta. Beach was relatively quiet with a few families about, the water was warm and best of all, we only came across two touts the whole morning we were there."
AvoJim,"Minyama, Australia",Aug 2016,"Great beach with swimming, snorkling, flying kites, and in Nusa Dua  area where people are friendly and safe."
RobDowling,"Sliema, Malta",Aug 2016,This is Bali beach....not more to add really. If you manage to get sunrise it's astounding. The waters are clean and refreshing. You just have to do this once in you life. 
LuxTravel321,"London, UK",Jun 2016,"This beach is very picturesque.  Yellow sand and turquoise, warm water. The beach was half-full but still very quiet and peaceful. The only downsides are the sand is a little grainy in a theraputic sort of way at times but not super soft and the sea has quite a few stones and seaweed so it can be a bit uncomfortable to swim in at times.  This beach is best for sunbathing on and if you want to take strolls on the beach."
chitra w,12 contributions,Jun 2016,"Clean, not too crowded with people, quite safe to swim. The sand is clean and almost white, kids will love to play there."
Shirish S,"London, UK",Apr 2016,"very large hotel, staff very freindly and helpful, breakfast excellent. On the beach, away from the congestion of the town, peaceful and relaxing"
cruisingayle,perth wa,May 2016,Great to get out and do some water sports the beaches are great to walk along has some f the best hotels with friendly staff 
Sarla T,"Wilmington, NC",Aug 2016,"Very peaceful beach, it does change depending on the tide some day is great for swimming some others not so much, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt and our beach area was very clean and lots of lounge chairs. However we did walk along the whole beach and noticed that some areas were not as clean, with a lot of garbage. The sand is not absolutely white but the water is very clear and sandy beach, with some coral areas that you can see very clear. We loved this beach, very quiet and peaceful. If you are looking for party atmosphere or surfing, this beach is not for you."
Jeanette O,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"The beach here is amazing, not too crowded, plenty of shade, awesome water and exceptionally clean. There are small food stalls and bars and not too many hawkers to annoy you"
Amit Shah,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",Apr 2016,I would not say this is a  very quite beach. You will find all kind of happening activities to perform with quite time in the evening with your loved ones.Just go and enjoy water sports activities here.
Damien B,"Officer, Australia",Aug 2016,I visited the Nusa Dua Beach during my stay at the Mercure Hotel in Nusa Dua. There was a dedicated Mercure beach area which was quiet nice. The atmosphere in general is rather relaxed and less populated with locals like the Kuta/ Legion beaches. I would recommend a visit to the beach if you prefer a cleaner and quieter experience. Plenty of water sports and activities available if thats what you're looking to do. 
iTravel-A2Z,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"This is a great beach with beautiful sea, hardly ever flat, expect waves and some sea wead. It is beautiful and quiet though compared with Kuta/ Seninyak."
baliyaya,"New York City, NY",Aug 2016,An incredible breathtaking experience through Kayumanis Nusa Dua. Sunrises around 6. Very quiet and serene. The breeze is cool to warm. 
jamnaeem01,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2016,When visiting bali please stay at nusa dua . Lush greenery .. direct access to beaches..kuta was crowded visited a few hours.. dinner jimbaran beach was good ..bubu was good. Para sailing took too long 
sourav g,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Jul 2016,The access of the beach is restricted because of the hotels being built.However we walked down one evening from Grand Bali Hotel took us 15 min walk.They have also a private beach we went one morning where we relaxed for couple of hours.The water looks blue as the eyes wander into the ocean.The depth is not much for couple of hundred metres as the waves break well before it reaches the shore hence the water is gentle and also the children can wade in the shallow water for some distance.The beach is clean with white sand.Enjoyed myself in the water
Sarah S,52 contributions,Aug 2016,Stunning blues at the Indian Ocean. Gorgeous. The beach is mostly lined with a a variety of hotels on either side of dharma island. If you get to the entry of farms island and take a right there are more party hotels and sand bar type locations. To the left are the resort beaches- not sure what access is like if you aren't a guest...but a bit cleaner and a little more quiet 
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"This beach complex is very well maintained, the road lead to this beach is very confusing because it looked like you are in a very expensive housing complex rather than on a beach complex. there are many access to this beach but most of them were privatized by hotel so you must follow the map direction not the direction from your gps. the entrance fee is free. but at the beach you will see that this beach was very commercialized from the hotel that stood on that area. the best place to visit this beach is when the sun rise as the tide will be high and you could see the amazing view."
Shrutee K,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2016,Rode on a 2 wheeler from Seminyak to Nusa Dua. The road connecting the two (through Mandara toll road) is breathtaking. Lots of hotels on the beach offering great variety in food. Strolled for entire afternoon and evening.Highly recommended for the Mandara toll road and leisure walk
Bruno R,13 contributions,Aug 2016,If you want a relaxing quite holiday away from your everyday city life come to nusa dua.Great shopping close byeBeutiful beaches 
yvonnecar,"London, UK",Jul 2016,"Spent a delightful afternoon at this beautiful beach.  Took the Kura Kura bus from Seminyak via Galleria Mall to Ayodya Resort.  You have to walk through this huge hotel to access the beach, then you can hire a beach umbrella and loungers for Rupiah100."
Grenville R,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2016,Good beach..not as crowded as the other beaches in Bali....would visit again if given an opportunity.
Mats N,"Trondheim, Norway",Aug 2016,"Clean super nice beach, it's worth the visit. Lovelely clear water, lot's of restaurants. Would choose a hotel there next time"
DavidS2969UG,"Warwickshire, UK",Aug 2016,Beach is lovely. Very clean with golden sand. Very shallow so kids can paddle around safely. Brought our snorkelling gear but tide was out so didn't see many fish as the water was too shallow.Many bars and restaurants set back from the beach all serving food at reasonable prices.
banyquatro,"Algard, Norway",Jul 2016,Clean and peaceful beach!It is a beautiful long white beach which fades into the distance to a peninsular which has a very large statue.  it was a wonderful way to spend the day.
carolkano,"Sao Paulo, SP",Sep 2015,"the calmest and the best beach ever, also is very clean. Perfect beach for every one and for all activity "
Prizzle,"Oxford, UK",Jul 2016,Really nice beach. Big resorts aren't really my thing but I hired a driver to visit some different beaches particularly ones good for swimming rather than surfing. Not too busy and quite peaceful. Would recommend 
cmwithers91,"Rugby, UK",Aug 2016,"Such a lovey beach! Very blue sea and white sand! Lots of places to walk along the beach and many restaurants! Would probably avoid the hotel restaurants as they are expensive. Walk along to the Bali bay part of the beach and there are a range of places to eat for mostly half the price. People are around the beach trying to sell things, however if you say 'no thank you' they always leave you alone. A must visit in Nusa Dua. Also if it's a windy day you should visit waterboom which is just past the Bali bay section.  "
Julia,"London, UK",Sep 2015,"Nusa Dua Beach is spectacular: beautiful blue water and fine sand, palm trees and tranquillity. Plenty of starfish if you like water life."
BdCTravel,7 contributions,Aug 2016,I could move here in a heart beat. Love the beach. My favourite place is Westin at Nusa Dua. Great restaurants. Lot of things to do.
Mayurpatell,"Jaipur, India",Jul 2016,This is a one of the nice beach for privacy and less crowd in Nusa Dua. Almost resorts having its privet beach area here.
Achibitsy,"Bucharest, Romania",Aug 2016,"As all resorts are there, the bars and restaurants on the beach are quite expensive. Beautiful beach though and great place to relax."
Jeremy W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,The beaches at the Nusa Dua complex are kept really clean as they are in front of some really expensive hotel. Lots of inexpensive warungs and beach clubs for those not staying at the hotels. If driving there it is one of the few spots in the south of the island where it is still possible to park without some locals charging for it.
garylamba,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"Stayed at Westin and chilled by beach on daily basis , beach has high tide from sunrise to around 2ish and then beach becomes more of rocky beach and tourists walk around and explore the rocky areas.You don't get harassed by people that much  trying to sell and all hotels have their private areas so you get constant supply of drinks , food , towels etc."
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"It locates in the corner of the island, beautiful beach, very clear water. Crowded people on the weekend, not only foreigner enjoying the place, but also local people with their children spread out the carpet on the beach, and enjoying their snacks and drink. No ticket to access this beach."
Globerwalker,"Seoul, South Korea",Jul 2016,"The beach was kept very clean, had nice white sand and blue water, deep enough to swim in and not too rough. There are places around to buy food and drink, but the roving vendors are a bit annoying.  An enjoyable place to visit."
ritascas,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,"Cannot fault anything... from staff, rooms, service and location.Paradise! Very relaxing soaking in the sun, beautiful pools, great food."
HansenDKK,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jul 2016,When the tide is not low Nusa Dua Beach is really nice and you can snorkel right as you get into the water. You will see around 20-30 different species close to the costal line.
Claire M,"Leatherhead, UK",Sep 2015,Beautiful and clean beach. One of the best things being there was very little litter or hassle from sellers like on a lot of beaches in Bali. 
DeHeavenTour Official,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2016,Bali has many beaches. But nusa dua is one of the best for family / honey mooner to visit Bali. The scenery is amazing. Wave is very friendly..even the sand is a bit rough. Many nice restaurants to hang out/chilling. No wonder so many 5 star hotel having the wedding ceremony on nusa dua beach. 
Danny T,"Newbury, UK",Aug 2016,"Nicest beach I have ever seen, pale yellow soft sand, warm sea and views for miles...There are a few hawkers selling kites, sarongs etc.  But they are friendly and gentle 'no thank you' sees them move on."
RAVI K,"Chennai (Madras), India",Aug 2016,I am yet to see such a long stretch of  a very well maintained and clean beach in these parts. Evenings are great for a 7 km walk down this beach.
Desislava D,Bulgaria,Jun 2016,"We stayed at Melia for one week. The beach was not overcrowded. It was clean and safe, perfect to swimming, before the low tide, with golden sand. It was perfect to taking pictures. Love it!"
Maureen W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Stayed at the NUSA DUA BEACH HOTEL  A complete relaxation holiday for couples families and singles. The Hotel staff are exceptional and caring, location is great you  have sun, sand beach, walks eat drink and totally relax and meet some new friends."
Lou C,"Havelock North, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"We went to the public area of the beach. Not many people on the beach infact about 4! A clean safe beach to swim in with golden sand. Back from the beach are the usual stalls selling food, drink and everything else."
Achmad Maulana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Stay In Bali National Golf Resort, walked along the Nusa dua beach, bliss full and quite place, nice sandy beach with food stall sell along the beach belong to each hotel in ITDC, very attractive and comfort place to hanging around with friends or family, as its equipped with jogging track along the coast, dont worry about the food and drink, from cheapest to expensive are available along the beach, from small hut to luxurious club also available"
khengsoon,penang,Jul 2016,This beach was very windy when I was there. I enjoyed just sitting there and strolled along the beach with many scenic corners for photo shooting. Worth visiting the place again
Hitesh Patel,"Harrow, UK",Aug 2016,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt and as expected you get what you pay for!Very large resort, may not suit everyone so please check if suitable for family."
Oleg S,176 contributions,Aug 2016,"Nice view, ocean with sand beach, lots of hotel on the beach, lots of security stuff everywhere, wonderful nature trees, birds, small animals"
Bipashyee,"London, UK",Jun 2016,"We stayed for a couple of days in Nusa Dua and checked out the beach. It wasn't amazing, as we expected. It was a golden sand beach - long stretch and wasn't much dramatic. It was still nice to hang out in, to swim and spend time with family, but I wouldnt go to Nusa Dua all the way to check out this beach. "
PrithviHaldea,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2016,"Worth a visit, a vast long beach...However, too many stones on the shore took some pleasure away. Nice beach eating joints."
Sharon W,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2016,"This is a lovely beach but my husband went body surfing and he hurt his neck quite badly.  He is an experienced body surfer, been around water for 40+ years but he still got dumped by the waves.  We were really lucky that he didn't do too much damage.  Those waves are powerful."
ulnirmal,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Jul 2016,This beach is a nice place to relax during holidays. Calm and quite beach with clean waters. mind relaxing
wendy j,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2016,Lovely beach. Quiet for Bali    Nice Cafes restaurants beach hire.   Cool and clean.  Nice for families.  Saw some flagged area.  Calm. Lovely.  Can get massage.  Not many hawkers.  
McWitch,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"It's hard to rate beaches highly when you come from Australia and are spoilt by beautiful wide beaches.  The sand isn't white like you see in all the pictures, but it's lovely and calm waters are inviting nonetheless.  At low tide, watch out for sea urchins!!"
Steph Y,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Clean beach with Ma y places to sit and relax. Minimal people harassing you and security along the beach as well as a life guard or two.
WW_Traveller_1965,"Milan, Italy",Aug 2016,This beach is long and nice to walk on. Most of the Nusa Dua best resorts are there. However we were very disappointed to find garbage like plastic bags and bottles as well as other human waste on both the sand and the water. Those hotels should pay  more attention on it!
Timo K,"Espoo, Finland",Aug 2016,The beach seems to be more or less restricted for the big hotels offering packages for chairs with food. You can still find independent places where you can eat or drink. I had an afternoon walk from my hotel and back. Luckíly it was windy and not too hot.
ztakacs1973,"Novi Sad, Serbia",Jul 2016,beautiful water IF no storm!!! otherwise full of plastic debris! the nearby park is worth a visit. the sellers at the beach are not too pushy. you can find great deals at the beach when people are offering nearby sports activities! bargain!!!
ruli,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"This beach is very nice,clean and not too crowded compare to kuta...the place is romantic if you stay in the resort of nusa dua...one the best beach in bali 👍"
Martin A,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2016,Sorry but it's a nice beach not a great one.  It's okay is how I would put it.  Make sure you have a good pool at your hotel and you will be fine.
pameilama,Switzerland,Jul 2016,"The Nusa Dua Beach is a very clean and tidy beach area with a lot of potential! In our one week holiday at Nusa Dua we spent about 3 days relaxing and hanging around at the beach and it was quite nice. The sand is brown, very clean but not that smooth. During the day the water level was low tide but clean. There a few locals trying to sell you stuff but they understand a simple no thank you and will then leave you alone."
Peter S,"Liverpool, UK",Sep 2015,"This beach is for lovers too, and you will leave your footprints. Clean is not a word, this place is stunning clean. "
Melly,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,Nusa Dua beach located in Nusa Dua complex. Most of the beach is in front of the hotel or hotel beach walk. Must visit water blow spot. Amazing view from wave blow into the reef. 
talven,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Beautiful for a walk or jog in the morning and water is blue and beautiful. However, when we were there there were warnings up regarding jellyfish and other sea creatures due to the winds so we decided to have a quick dip in the warm water and then move to the pools in our resort. But definitely a peaceful place to sit down and read a good book!"
Young L,"Cypress, Texas, United States",Jul 2016,"This is an OK beach, not great for swimming, but if you like water activities, this is it.  This beach is much quieter, not too crowded."
Domi Nik,"Ennetbuergen, Switzerland",Aug 2016,Very nice and calm beach with withe sand and beautiful view to the horizon. Perfect water conditions clean beach and ideal for kids as they can walk into the sea.
sevjenh,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2016,"Overcrowded, with lots of boats going around the snorkeling site, which made us skip the snorkeling. The site was also full of people seawalking, probably scaring off whatever fish was there in the first place. Saw nothing but kelp from the glass bottom boat. The area is close to some sort of industrial dock, and didn't smell good. The water is really dirty and full of trash. This is a horrible tourist-machine and complete rip-off!"
Timtamtummy,"Changi, Singapore",Jul 2016,"Lovely beach promenade to walk along (you can push a stroller along the path easily), and you get to see the different resorts. Beach is great too. "
RoystaDoysta,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"As most people will point out this is a great place to walk or hire a bike for a long ride. The beaches are good and there are a few places to see like the blowhole and the temple island. There are lots of bars and restaurants along the way north of the blowhole, and a huge open beach south of it. Great for chilling and spending a day..."
luiting,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,"clean beach, soft sand, free of rocks! Loved it! But the bars and beach clubs there are definitely catered to tourists, at a higher price of course! "
FastTreck,"Valsad, India",Jun 2016,"Beautiful and clean beach to spend valuable time with friend and family, Mostly visit in early morning or in evening time to get good weather."
robfratelli,"London, UK",Jul 2016,"The waters dirty with rubbish and lots of seaweed and isn't the crystal clear waters you expect from a place like Bali.Not much character either, safe to say we stuck to our hotel pool.We stayed at Grand Mirage."
hieronymus67,"Beachwood, OH",Jul 2016,"Beautiful beach. Very clean. Very friendly local people offering a massage, water sports activities, or to sell some local souvenirs. Undeep waters. Very safe. Very predictable tide. "
irwan e,75 contributions,Jul 2016,"I stay in the Grand Whiz Hotel, next to the Sofitel. So only 3 min walk to the beachThe beach is clean and the sea is calm. So you can swim around the area of near the Club Med hotel.The beach itself is a public space, but you cant use the coach/sofa in of the Club Med, unless you are the guest of that hotel.This is really a perfect spot to see sunrise"
amit s,"London, UK",Jul 2016,if you're staying in Nusa dua your resort will be connected to the beach. it's conviniently close by and enjoyable to spend an afternoon relaxing.
Husain R,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,loved the blue waters & tranquility. It was very peaceful & quiet and since it was a private kind of beach it was secure too
Priya P,"Leicestershire, UK",Jul 2016,"The beach itself is lovely and stretches out far beyond the eye can see! However, one thing I was quite disheartened by was the amount of plastic bottles, crisp packets and general rubbish floating around the shallows. However, on some days, staff cleaned this up. There is no shortage of water activities at the beach. You're generally taken a little speedboat ride away from the swimmers to avoid any accidents, where you can find banana boating, water sleding (or flyfishing), jet skiing, parasailing, etc. For dining, there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. Definitely worth a relaxing visit."
rubyroomaisymoo,"Bournemouth, UK",May 2016,"The hotel was wonderful and everywhere was very clean, the food was amazing and we were given a huge choice. I needed to change my room and they did this very quickly. Ideal family Hotel, 2 beautiful pools lots of places to eat and very safe. I would go back there on my next visit."
b4eve,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2016,Perfect water quality like an island not a main land beach but only a tiny bit of beach is public most belongs to the expensive resorts.  It's still nice enough for a day and the restaurant has all you need for refreshments plus 25k beach chairs or towels
VivekDalal,"Lusaka, Zambia",May 2016,nice and clean beach. too crowded in evenings. lots of restaurants around. live music was also playing in some of them. perfect for clicking pics 
jua83,"Paarl, South Africa",Jul 2016,Have been travelling all over Bali I would recommend Nusa Dua for families travelling with small kids. Nice family resorts can be found in this area.
potatolord 5,72 contributions,Jul 2016,Probably the best beach we saw in Bali. The sand was more yellow than other beaches we visited. There was plenty of trash in the sea and in the morning it appears that the various beachfront hotels rake up the trash and bury it on the beach. I didn't see any lifeguards. We did see a few fish in the sea along with one small sea snake although the water was a bit churned up for snorkeling.
Sonya G,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Stayed at Nusa Dua in Ayodya Resort which was lovely and had a well-maintained beach.  Staff cleaned the beach of rubbish washed up onto the sand and dug the seaweed back into the sand.  We went for a swim once in 7 days.  The water has seaweed and rubbish floating in the water.  We swam between the flags further down the beach - however, there was still an undertow where the flags were located and a strong pull - definitely not a place to lose your footing or have children have a swim.  The flags didn't move the whole 7 days - so rips and undercurrents don't move and are there safer areas to swim on certain days than others?I guess I'm used to the beautiful, well-patrolled beaches of the Gold Coast and Perth, Australia."
Sigitpramono,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"I prefer this beach than Kuta Beach due to quite and beautiful. white sand beach and good enough wave....laid down on sand and enjoy sunshine...I love Bali. the beach is clean and not many sellers move around offer their product. Indeed, more comfortable and love this beach so much. "
JakoMD,"Hovik, Norway",Jul 2016,"Stayed at the Melia. The beach was perfect for our kids 3, 9 and 11. Very shallow at low tide. Nice atmosphere. Good service at the Level."
Costi_Miu,"Heilbronn, Germany",Jul 2016,It's quite different from place to place. The beach by hotel grand Niko is pretty good especially for family with kids but there are some other much beautiful places. Especially for surfing and singles.
David W,Hong Kong,Jul 2016,Expansive beach with knee high wavesA bit of soft rubbish but nice enough. A few hidden rocks  but nothing dramatic and the bigger waves are out the back! 
MonaR24,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2016,I was there in Jan 2016.The beach is beautiful with alot of water sports activities to choose from.Definitely worth going.
travelbugsme,Singapore,Jun 2016,"Calm beach to be compared to some other benches in Bali. Not very crowded as each hotel maintain their own area. Seen a few locals trying to sell tourist their loots, was pretty alright when been rejected."
Vera N,3 contributions,Jul 2016,Some places are very dirty at the beach. So many plastic bottles and screwtops and plasticbags. At some parts of the beach where the top hotels are you get shushed away by security guards. 
Leah M,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"An absolutely stunning Beach, super clear water and so clean in general. Never over crowded, plenty of places to eat/snack in he enclave of hotels! The best private beach I've ever been to! "
gaylemac2016,"Glasgow, UK",Jul 2016,Stunning beach! Clean sand with turquoise waters.  Just paradise and good for families with only a small amount of water sports so it felt fairly safe. 
theRoamingMurphys,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2016,"This is a beautiful beach... white sand and not too busy, though it is public. We found there to be a little too much garbage floating in the water to want to swim, but sitting at the beach was lovely. Be wary of the beach vendors though, they are very nice but very persistent. "
manjeet a,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"The beach is wide and has mangrove trees at certain parts if you are looking for shade. It has a great walking pathway which is used by cyclists and walkers between the many resorts and hotels situated along the beach. There are a lot of food outlets and excellent restaurants for a really wonderful time at the beach, not to mention the lovely massage ladies and their attractive prices. Be sure to haggle with them."
katty403,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Most beautiful clean beach  lounges right to the sand and beaut beach bar and food available lovely end of day watching the sun go down 
Winnie19821987,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Stayed first week in Tanjung Benoa. DO NOT GO THERE. Went on the the beach  and all you can smell is the fumes from the boat engines and you can't swim. It's disgusting. Nusa Dua is quiet, clean sand, clear water and no water sports going on. Lovely, must see..."
Dianne H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"I visited the beach early June 2016.I was delighted with the facilities the Amarterra Villa provided on their section of the beach. Its a beautiful long white beach which fades into the distance to a peninsular which has a very large statue and roofs popping over the top of the surrounding trees. I thought it would be a great spot for photos of the sunrise. It didn't disappoint me! I had an easy walk along the beach amongst the sea shells, rocks and a small amount of seaweed. I captured some lovely photos of the sun rising, and the waves crashing around the peninsular which sent spray up into the air. A lovely white beach that was easy to walk on and very pleasant to look at."
rbhambha,"Santa Cruz, CA",May 2016,"Nusa Dua was my favorite of all beaches I visited during my time in Bali. It's super chill, clean, and lovely. I spent most of my time lying out on my chair under an umbrella, occasionally taking a dip, and it was a wonderful way to spend the day. Stayed here for a good 6 hours or so. The food being served was cheap and quite good, with the service also being good. All in all, I highly recommend spending a day here, and invest in an umbrella. It's worth it."
miralpatel309 .,38 contributions,Feb 2016,"I had been there from 12thfeb to 14th Feb. It is really a nice place for newly married couple. All places like hotel,restaurants, bars,and local markets are near to beach. And beach is also quiet good. And u can experience a clean water on beach. A local peoples and vendors are also quiet good and helpfull. It is really a good experience in Bali. "
Travelloverlady,"London, UK",Jul 2016,"The beach provides great people watching and easy walking opportunities, the neat and helpful pathway along it also enables you to cycle round this area very easily.  The reef that protects the beach from big waves does hamper any major sailing opportunities."
Allymharris,34 contributions,Jul 2016,"Stunning beach!! Very clean! there are so many wonderful watersports at your fingertips. There are also loads of beach clubs where you can go, order drinks and relax on a lounger. Great place cleanest beach I've seen in Bali "
"John, D.","New York City, NY",Jul 2016,"When it is low tide (most of the day), the beach is disgusting and very shallow until the reef barrier (and you can't pass the reef barrier as waves are too high), no swimming or snorkeling possible.The only ""clean"" areas from the beach are located in front of resorts, who decided these would became ""private"" beaches.There are guards patrolling everywhere and chasing travelers. They will try to extort 363,500 Rp from you, claiming this is a ""resort fee"" (yep, more than in Vegas!) and if you refuse, you will have to walk back to the gate.Pathetic given the amount of money they are making with tourists, do yourself a huge favor and skip this place!"
ThompsonBuggins,"Bushmills, UK",Aug 2015,"We went there for our final day in Bali. Our hired driver and friend took us to a public beach between the fancy hotels. There were a few restaurants with local food and beach benches to rent. We stayed in the water the entire time. The temperature was perfect. The sand and ocean beautiful like a postcard. The further you walked away from the main area, the prettier and emptier as none of the hotel guests seemed to use the beach. Local fishermen were seen fishing from their boats and nets. It was all so beautiful and a lovely day out for our entire family. Crystal clear waters. "
Rochelle_NM,"London, UK",Jun 2016,You must visit this beach absolutely beautiful with a few places to purchase food and drink while you soak up the sun!!
Nellie B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,We stayed at the Ayodya Resort and absolutely loved the patrolled beach next to it. We swam a lot. The water is warm and clean - very enjoyable. 
HeatherG88,"Wamberal, Australia",Jul 2016,We have stayed here a number pf times now And It has a great family vibe. We love The Different restaurants around And The board walk that front some of The Big Hotels. A very safe area With lots to do if you like water sports or you can just Lay around And do nothing!
Hanson,8 contributions,Jun 2016,further away from the crowds and much cleaner than the Kuta beaches and great reeg walks at low tide. 
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"We last visited this area 30 years ago. Wow has it changed! Such a beautiful area. Beach is awesome, grassed area so clean no cars or bikes so great to enjoy an area without hassles."
mishii_mis,Slovakia,Jun 2016,"The beach is nice one of the better ones in Bali, but nothing really spectacular. Bali is not an island of stunning beaches though (with few exceptions). Bali is about something different. Water is quite shallow so good for smaller kids. The beach offers beautiful sunsets and is good for a morning/evening walk. "
hanaicha,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"quiet and clean beach, my fave beach so far in bali. really love the sun-kissed hair and warm sand while walking without any sandals or shoes. will re-visit this place for sure."
James S,4 contributions,Jul 2016,Early morning walks i.e. 6am down the beach path are worth getting up for. The sunrise which was around 6.30am in July was spectacular. You also get to see the other facilities such as Sofitel and Westin.
Rodney P,4 contributions,Jul 2016,"Sofitel, Nusa Dua is very special! Try it!!!! It is a recommendation that I make lightly. Enjoy the wonderful atmosphere! In the Kwee-Zeen restaurant, be cared for by Tarka and Dedi, who work so hard to make the dining experience so special.Enjoy!"
Julieta G,"Braga, Portugal",Jul 2016,Warm and blues Water and the white sand are the perfect match!!!We love the quite and the possibilita of swimm :)
rakeshsureka,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2016,Awesome view of clear water... The horizon where blue meets blue... A must visit beach in south Bali...Lots of nice hotels and resorts in the area...The beach is well maintained and free from dirt... You will feel like going in water again and again...
Mazzaydc,"Busselton, Australia",Jul 2016,Such a beautiful beach with lovely luxurious hotels...but soo dirty - shameful really that these resorts don't take some responsibility for cleaning it up! 
stalin,mumbai,May 2016,"White sandy beach, clear waters. Lots of water sports activities . Very expensive to hire water scooters. They also organise Turtle conservation island tours which is not worth the effort nothing to see there Waves are gentle and relaxing..Options for food are limited. worth a half day trip from Kuta  The road on stilts in the sea leading to Nusa Dua is very scenic and worth a drive."
Fulya Y,74 contributions,Jul 2016,"Not cold water. Sea is clean and beach crew clean the everywhere. No stones, no trash and so peacefull air. Sea has wave everytime but it's so funny."
rathi_john,13 contributions,Jun 2016,Lovely beach with plenty of walkways. But there were plenty of tourists from China who were really loud and spitting everywhere. 
berkyrs,"Ankara, Turkey",Jul 2016,"It was a windy day, so there were lots of rubbish on the sand. It was really dirty. But hotel employees were trying to clean the beach. Despite everything sea color is beatiful. "
Daniel P,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,The beach is not meant to be played with the kids.. It is full of coral and the sand is a bit dirty... Yet the view is amazing!
yifanflying,"Shanghai, China",Jul 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is more clean than Kuta and very beautiful. You can enjoy more by some private beach such St.Regis Resort
s_klafko,"Bergen, Norway",Jul 2016,"Beach looks ok, but definitely no place for bathing in the sea. Dirty water. Nicest areas in front of huge resorts with signs warning against going in the sea! Only suited as scenic back drop for the luxury hotels and for water sports. For the really nice beaches and great bathing head to towards Padang Padang, kind of crowded but not a problem."
adrndragan,"Bucharest, Romania",Jul 2016,"Nusa Dua beach , right along the The Laguna resort offers an excellent relaxing , quite time , under the dense exotic vegetation .The ocean is warm and long baths are making the day .  Bad point : every day I picked plastics from the ocean thrown mainly by locals and turists. This is really shame for all of us ..."
Frank M,Europe,Jul 2016,"From reading other reviews, there have been deaths at the beach due to the rough water. It is actually deceiving as the shoreline break appears tame compared to the offshore one. The issue here is that there are no lifeguards patrolling the beach so you venture at your own risk. This surprised me given the myriad of resorts that define this location. I had a scare when my kayak capsized at the offshore break and the relentless string of waves made it tough to catch your breath and make a go at returning to shore. Be sure to wear life jackets so you can enjoy the waves without excess peril "
Gunawan K,7 contributions,Jul 2016,If you like quite and clean beach..you must come to this beach..It feel the beach is your own...Slow wave and safe for children to swim..
Dariusz S,11 contributions,Jul 2016,"Beach is fantastic, even the people that try and sell you things are nice and not pushy. I recommed it"
DGK65,"Washington DC, DC",Jul 2016,"The beach is huge, but large selection has the rocks here and there. Better to ware the rubber shoes going down the water, especially for the younger kids"
Surfweb,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2016,The luxury hotels front this beach and there is not much sand to actually call it a beach. The hotel pools are more appealing. At this time of year there is meant to be trade winds blowing and mild weather. Unfortunately it was raining most of the time. Not good beach weather.Still it has a very nice atmosphere and views.Nusa Dua is a place to relax away from the hectic traffic and crowds in Kuta. It's a good family beach. Safe for young children to play if kept close to shore.
Anna K,4 contributions,Jul 2016,So far the better and clearer beach I see in Nusa Dua. Lots of visitors but the beach was well maintain and good for swimming.
rebecca h,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nusa Dua reminds me of Denaurau in Fiji. It's a nice beach but it lacks what the rest of Bali offers as far as a destination is concerned, it's basically conservative at best. It is expensive because unlike Seminyak it doesn't offer a lot outside of the actual resorts. Yes you could do 2 nights here but anymore would probably drive you a little mad unless you were wanting complete rest, poolside reading and not much else."
Ian F,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2016,"The beach areas in this gated area are very clean for the majority of the time. Beach cleaners are on duty all day ensuring that the area is clear of rubbish and debris. Having said that, some ignorant tourists cannot help themselves and do make extra work for the beach cleaners. There are areas particularly at low tide where there are patches of sea weed and this is an area where Sea Urchins can be found and if stood on or handled, they can cause some considerable pain (personal experience!) Resort medical clinics are used to dealing with the multiple wounds caused by these creatures if attended to promptly, Great swimming and medium surf, a very safe environment and even for the kids at the time when the tides are not moving. Tidal movement is easily found out through resort staff or internet. Foot ware is recommended for some help against Urchin spikes and the occasional sharp pieces of coral that will wash up from the reef that is further out from the beach area."
Trevor J,33 contributions,Jun 2016,The beaches in Nusa Dua are far nicer and a lot cleaner than those near Kuta or Jimbaran Bay. There was a lot less litter and the sand was far better. The under toe can be pretty strong in places though.
Anneta M,"Eguisheim, France",Jul 2016,"The beach is very nice, there aren't a lot of people so you can swim and sunbathe relaxed on your own. You have many activities to do as well like padel surfing, surfing, parachuting, banana, flying fish... And more! Also you cand find many people selling diferent things so you don't get bored! "
varindertoor,"Chandigarh, India",Jun 2016,Ritz Carlton Nusa Dua is heaven on earth ! It's a must and we loved every second of it. Great ambience and smiling staff make the moments memorable one.Loved every bit of our stay. Thanks to them.
Michelle B,"Hamilton Hill, Australia",Jul 2016,Brilliant beautiful clean relaxing beach lots of swimming fishing surfing and much more exciting things to join in with 
Kimberly,119 contributions,Jul 2016,Great great beach. Lovely! The flags will tell you whether it's safe to go or not. Nice place for a getaway or a holiday. Pricey because it's a tourist place. Many ang moh and everyone can speak English. 
Sumaya Al Attar,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2016,"Beautiful city, and down to earth people. I'm in love with this place. Though I suffered from the humidity, I still enjoyed my time visiting the temples and watching the Kechuk dance, sacred monkey forest... Got me loads of Luwak coffee too. "
TomiCiglenecki,2 contributions,May 2016,"Good snorkelling place, with shallow water and abundance of corral and sea life. Also nice for walks by the beach. "
Susan H,99 contributions,Jun 2016,"Was just there in June 2016, it was great! Very sandy and safe but shallow. Not a lot of people around."
TC77Syd,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,We found Nusa Dua really boring. Most restaurants and bars are part of the hotels so you don't really have the option to head into the town and find a great bar or restaurant. I'm sure the hotel ones are great but unlike Seminyak or Jimbaran Bay there are amazing restaurants you can stumble upon.The only shopping option really is Bali collection. Great if you're looking for nick nacks or clothing but it lacks atmosphere. You wouldn't necessarily head here for a day out. I think we spent about an hour here
travelerxhan,California,Jun 2016,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali and were right in front of Nusa Dua Beach. The beach is gorgeous--very fine sand and the water is nice and warm. You can also learn to surf there so that's quite nice. The only downside was that there were so much trash floating around the beach area--we picked things up for only a few minutes and had a great big pile of trash. Considering it's a resort area, we were surprised that there was so much trash. I would like to clarify that is not like it's a landfill but when you look closely, you can see plastic bottles, plastic wrappers, etc everywhere. We liked the beach but it was depressing to see as we are both divers and know that all of this trash eventually ends up in the oceans and could harm marinelife."
R_Sweden,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2016,"First of all, this is not really Bali. But the beach is clean, have no big waves and water is clean. All luxurious hotels is in front of the beach is here back to back. You won't find the daily Bali beach life here. You find your own privet hotel beach with sun beds. "
brenny68,"Littlehampton, Australia",Jun 2016,"Love Nusa Dua.  My favourite local balianese cab driver is TJ, he is a local to the area, speaks English really well and a wonderful tour guide if you ask questions along the way.   Our whole family have used him or his family/friends for travelling around Bali.  He will drive you around all day for about 50 AU.  Ring 085935102585  I usually get the hotel to ring him and then we speak with him and discuss a price."
Biztraveller15,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,The higher king tides and rough weather had destroyed the beach area and the erosion had gotten past the stone retaining walls and had started to eat in to the front lawn areas of the restaurants that front the beach.
Nopuma,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2016,"Quite disappointed with this beach and so were my boys who were travelling out of the U.S. for the first time.  I suppose my husband and I are spoiled by the beaches of Grand Cayman, Turks and Caicos, or  the absolute clear waters of Bora Bora, so I will just report what we observed as best I could.There were four areas where we where that had lounge chairs.  One charged, 365,000 IDR per person (approx. $28/pp), we chose the ones closest to the end of the beach next to a hut with a bar and dining area.  Food was ok and a bit more expensive than usual but that was expected.  There were quite a few vendors selling jewelry, kites, sarongs, and paintings, walking around.  They were respectful until one in the end of the day, who was a bit aggressive about his sales tactics.The beach was a bit crowded. Lots of seaweed and washed up rubbish as others previously mentioned. We will not return."
Seow F,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,"Even for a stroll, it was very relaxing.  With backup facilities and services from the hotel within reach."
Sudhir C,"Doha, Qatar",Jun 2016,Good beach for visit in day time close to the city. There are hotels offering transport to the beach. The penensula garden is close by with the water hole to see some splashing.
Shaun S,"Ballarat, Australia",Jun 2016,Having walked the length of this beach there does appear to be some resorts who put a little extra effort in cleaning up the beach front than others. There is a reef pretty close in and this appears to be popular with local fishermen at night. The swimming area is contained within a line of buoys. The walkway up from the beach is clean but again it appears that each resort looks after it's own strip. Popular with runners and people out for a walk. The local sellers aren't overly imposing and a range of items are available for sale.
Phil G,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Stayed at the Melia Bali resort at the southern end  of Nusa Dua beach which is certainly the more picturesque end of the beach. (Same locale as the Westin resort) Also close to Bali Collection which is the only local shopping area.  The lagoon is also protected from the prevailing wind so great play to try stand up paddle boarding.  As you head north things become a bit more basic with parts of the walking path washed away and lots of rubbish around. Similarly as you go south towards the Hyatt parts of the pathway has also been washed away like everywhere in Bali you have to pick your spot!
Margie I,"Tampa, Florida, United States",May 2016,It was worth the trip to see the Nusa Dua Beach in Bali!The sand was white- the water crystal clear!There was a barrier so that you could swim out and enjoy the water without worrying about the waves & current taking you away!
Andresguia,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2016,"Nusa Dua Beach is among the most beautiful beaches of Bali, a stretch of white sandy beach with palm trees and blue water with coral reefs where live dozens of colorful fishes. This is an ideal place for sunbathing and swimming as the coral reefs make it like a little lagoon protecting us from the deep water. The strolls at the long beach is a beautiful experience."
Stephen M,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"A nice beach. Wide, good sand and at least a few km long. There is a walking or cycling path along almost the entire length which has right of way through the hotels that front the beach. The beach is protected by a reef and the waves break out on the reef. Much of the beach is safe with only small waves (eastern, blow hole island end). However the beach is more dangerous along near the Novotel beach club - there is a strong current there at times. There are some life guards but I would not rely on them. Be careful. The surf break out on the reef seems to work ok at times but I am not a surfer. The water is fairly clean but there is some floating rubbish. The hotels that front the beach keep the sand clean. The beach is very shallow at low tide right out to the reef. No good for swimming or anything at low tide. We stayed in the Courtyard hotel and their beach club at the eastern end of the beach near the blow hole island is great with sun chairs etc. Many of the other hotels provide sun chairs as well.You can rent surf boards and paddle boards at various places along the beach. Not the best beach I have been to by any measure but not bad. We enjoyed it. "
Totumgirl,Australia,Jun 2016,This beach is dirty with lots of rubbish washed up on the sand. The walking path along the beach is also very dangerous and most of it has been washed away. The beach has a lot of rock/concrete in it so be careful not to cut your feet. Don't waste your time visiting this beach
Azamat K,"Moscow, Russia",Jun 2016,"Almost no waves and no surfers, but sand and water are beautiful and beach is great to spend time with family."
Mrhamlet,58 contributions,Jun 2016,We like the Beach and the area and there are a lot of nice hotels along the Beach. The are also a big shoppingcenter close and they have ok restaurants and many shopps. The pricerange are a litle bit higher here then lets say in Sanur or Ubud. The Beach can be a bit dirty some Times' with things from the sea. We will be back. 
Maturity,"Western Australia, Australia",Jun 2016,There were plenty of beach chairs under shady trees on this lovely beach. The sea had quite an undertow though. Beach vendors approached with saris etc for sale but were no problem.
Alex R,129 contributions,Jun 2016,You can swim before 13:00 only! Lots of dust and remnants this time of the year! Afternoon is busy time for swimming pool! But only one in the hotel! Today I fished out of the sea a big door! Follow the other pictures I have made:)
AmyHickson,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,We have stayed in Nusa Dua on many occasions and quite often we visit the beach to lounge on the chairs. The beach is always clean and tidy with workers there throughout the day to rake the beach and bury the seaweed. The water is clean and you can swim in the water without worry. Nusa Dua Beach is MUCH nicer than Seminyak and really is a lovely beach to visit.

chris,"Cebu City, Philippines",May 2016,Didn't have the time to take a swim but the sight and sounds of the big waves are relaxing.  There are so many restaurants to have a romantic dinner.  The place is also not crowded.
Tbcbusboy,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,"It's only nice on the private beach available to luxury Travellers staying at the resorts there. If you go to the public side, you'll realise that it's very messy and still has some wreckage from the large waves."
Ray K,8 contributions,Jun 2016,"I like this place also beautiful sand, wave and valley ball beach,and a lot of activities, conference, meeting, weding, party, celebration etc.all staff very nice:)even souvenior so nice and cheap"
RJRE,Maryland,Aug 2015,"Nice beach, but we found in the early part of the day, the water was way out, and the beach was full of seaweed and shells etc. When the tide came in though, it was wonderful. Water was clean, clear and calm, so good for children to swim too."
Liz J,"Melville, Australia",Jul 2015,Nice beach to walk along and swim. Lots of nice restaurants and a botanical park close by. There is quite a bit of rubbish on the beach which I thought would have been cleaned up every morning but wasn't.
Gian B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,This beach has an amazing walk trail passing many great hotels.We stayed at the Sofitel and enjoyed the walk. The pictures tell the story. 
Unclekiki,9 contributions,Jun 2016,"Nusa dua  beach is absolutely stunning, only downfall is food is more expensive than other places but beside that it's definitely worth checking out"
ch0u60,"Irvine, CA",Jun 2016,Dont want to leave the ocean.....the beach on the property of The Mulia resort has view of balinese temple up high
Ash_Dom,Perth,Jun 2016,At the moment with the huge swell I would recommend just appreciating the beauty from high up on shore. Whilst we were there a couple of people died due to the large waves. I understand this is a once every 10 year phenomenon.
Veronica,"Houston, TX",Jun 2016,"Beautiful beach, but very rough waters. It is very difficult to swim there. Lots of hotels on the beach. It was not very busy for a beautiful beach. It's quite a walk unless you're staying at a nearby hotel. "
bidyut1986insomniac,"Guwahati, India",May 2016,"good for water sports.peaceful location.not good for bathing..food is ok, a bit expensive. water is clear."
Rydog82,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"If you just want a chilled beach lined with resorts then this is your thing. There isn't really much of a path to go biking on, but you can walk on the path for a bit but it ends quite abruptly which is a bummer."
davudsons,sydney,Jun 2016,"Nusa Dua has clean white sand, clear water and a level sea bed which is fairly shallow without being unswimable.  The beach is well kept and has a few vendors without it becomming a nuisance. ..just a welcome distraction from time to time. I would certainly say that it is one of the nicest swimming beaches in a tourist area on Bali."
PFCampbell72,3 contributions,Jun 2016,Spacious family room. Very helpful check in staff for our complicated check in. So impressed by Sebastian and crew re food options and service.  Breakfast is the bomb  
Rawan S,10 contributions,Apr 2016,"The beach and the neighborhood was terrible, really overrated, not a very friendly neighborhood to walk at night. The beach wasn't clean at all.  "
Edwin F,"Puebla, Mexico",Jun 2016,"Beautiful beach, quiet, clean, no sellers there.Sea water is warm and clear and sand is smooth and white... This is a paradise!I really want to come back here"
Daniel A,"Beijing, China",Sep 2015,"Besides crystal clear waters, clean sand, excellent beach weather, ladies selling their homemade wares, not many people crowding you in the fairly empty sands, there are tourist police everywhere and they are also very friendly. I walked up to one and asked why there is a need for security and he said simply to keep you safe. One could not ask for more in a beach than all that I have mentioned and the added security. Go out and enjoy your fun in the sun and feel secure doing so."
Bhaskar Kumar,"New Delhi, India",Mar 2016,"Very neat & clean beach, perfect destination to enjoy in all respect, happening place with scenic beauty  "
Amelia_hasjim,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Love this beach so much as it is very clean, have a white sands and good facility.The location is close with the water blow that happening."
Chi11i_Concarne,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"The beach is great to relax as the breeze in the afternoon kicks in.  There is a blow hole you can walk to and get some nice photos.  The only detractor but unavoidable is that there is rubbish in the water.  This seems to be in any beach though, not just linked to Nusa dua.  The same goes for Kuta.I hope Indonesia can find a solution to this problem.  It's such a shame to see so much plastic in the ocean."
MelbourneWriter,Melbourne,Jun 2016,"Abnormally high tides in last few days. Beach path washed away just past Bali Collection. Hotels have sand bagged along beachside restaurants. Tides due to new moon and planet alignment are always higher this time of year, but this is not normal. Staff in hotels, beach front moved very fast and cleanup was efficient and thorough. Perfectly safe and still able to walk on most beaches. "
Christine A,1 contribution,Jun 2016,"Next time when i go to bali again, i will visit nusa dua bali. Great beach, good view and i love it. "
Frank D,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"the Nysa dual beaches near grand Hyatt were clean and the sand white and sandy but the waves were incredible. The days we spent there there were king tides so in some locations further along than grand Hyatt got a lot of litter washed up after the high tides.Much to the credit of the Hyatt staff, once high tide is over, they are there cleaning up sea weed and other litter washed up."
franky_windy,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,The beach very nice with a very beautiful view. But there is alot of rubish in the water.but over all i like it better than kuta beach...
Tk4490,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jun 2016,"Here is a nice place all hotels covered and nice view its not a place good for swim but for photo shoot its nice place, its a long beach"
artp777,"Trnava, Slovakia",Jun 2016,"Beatiful beach with many hotels, good food in this area. We were visit on june 2016 and weather was nice."
kathy_rodgers,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,The pale sand beach is very clean and quiet and a nice place to walk. The ocean is sonetimes too rough to swim in all areas.
Ralameel,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2016,"The topic says it all, this beach has one of the best sunset views ive witnessed, but unfortunately you don't get to swim due to dangerous waves. However it is fairly safe since lifeguards are all over the beach during day time (preventing drunks from killing themselves lol). I enjoyed my day walks there. "
eunicelu,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jul 2015,"Really nice, beautiful, relaxing beach. Romantic for couples. We really enjoyed it, not too crowded and delicate sands, perfect for walking."
Scottkjs,"Rainham, UK",May 2016,This is a perfect location to enjoy  swim at high tide but be careful of the rocks as the tide goes out. A great beach for a walk to relax and while away the hours
nanditava,Mumbai,Apr 2016,"Long.. clean.. widely stretched beautiful beach.. the water is so clear as you go deep, but from the start its just like any other "
Jeffrey Santoso,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Soft sandy beach with sky blue water, what more can you ask for? It is the perfect destination if you are looking for a tropical beach."
JasonMcClure,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Been to Bali 5 times but this was our first time at Nusa Dua. Beach here is really nice and we had some.fun times jumping the waves, although lost me hat and glasses in the surf. So close to the Kuta action now with the toll way. 😊"
kelaitre,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,"The beach was nice, quiet, not too many people. However waters were crowded with jetskis, water sports activities and speed boats. Waves were also large. Not many swimmers in the water. "
Viral M,"Kathmandu, Nepal",May 2016,"This place is 1 of the best places that I have ever been to! Very very scenic beach, clear water and beautiful sky.. many of the 5 star hotels are located here & they rent the beach beds for the day. After an early morning visit to Pandawa and/or Greger beach, just keep the rest of the day relaxing at Nusa dua beach. Apart from the scenic views, you can also enjoy in the swimming pools and order food and drinks beach side! They have very good showers & changing facilities so please don't hesitate spending time in the water. This beach is very secluded & most of times you feel its like your own private beach and contrary to the popular belief, it is not very expensive to spend the whole day here! This beach is not included in travel packages but I strongly recommend travelers to keep a spare day for this beach and go visit it yourself!"
uknowmj,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"First stop on my trip last time in Bali, never been there before so I kinda curious, riding motorcycle for the first time there and its thrilling for me, the weather was cloudy yet sunny yet cloudy again back and forth haha I can' t believe that it's free to visit this place! Wowww...awesomee..plus its not so many local people and the environment was really taking care by the nice resorts there, so many tourist there..the beach is nicee with the white sand..I think I can just lay down there enjoying the view, reading books or observe and find funny things to see..as simple as that :)"
Deborah77s,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,This is a private beach. Very clean and beautiful. The beach sofa is provided by Mulia resort where we were staying. So comfortable we like to spend hours just lying at the beach.
Mark G,"John O'Groats, UK",May 2016,Nice clean beach thanks to the beach cleaners who work hard after the tide starts to recede only down side to this area is the amount of plastic debris floating in on the tide
Angela R,sydney australia,May 2016,Beautiful warm beach very clean and it was very private. Nothing much bothering you. Local women selling things but no was no 
606clemt,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Jun 2016,The beach is very pretty and clean but the waves are quite big so not ideal for swimming. There is also quite a big incline down to the beach.
Prakash K,9 contributions,Oct 2015,"Though we did not spend more time on this beach as we were staying in a beach property, the Nusa Dua Beach is known for the variety of water sports activity and scuba diving.   Literally a day would seem too short to complete the beach sports activities.  We did not dive here as the waters are known to have currents, hence had to drive down for about  4  hours to a place called Tulamben."
r_rladda,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2015,The part of the beach i visited was very crowded but the water sports options available were amazing.
Barb T,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2016,"the beach is lovely right along the stretch of resorts, there is a path to walk along with restaurants, trees, sun beds, bean bags etc, or walk along the sand. Beach is white, water blue and mostly clean. There are patches where rubbish washes up, but resorts keep their areas clean. It's a great place for kids, when the tide is out, the kids can walk out and explore. Beautiful spot to take sunrise pictures. Wonderful place to sit on beanbag with a cocktail in the evening and enjoy the scenery and breeze, very relaxing."
RabiulH,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2015,Very serene beach. Mostly allocated to luxury hotels around. However free beach is there. Not too many people. Very peaceful. Option is there for watersports.
Paulo Tavares,"Lisbon, Portugal",Nov 2015,"This is a great beach, with calm very warm water. You don't get any waves very often, it's almost like a lake...On the low tide, you can walk a long distance with the water around your knees deep.The sand is very nice and you can have a very pleasant walk along the whole extension of the beach."
Max D,"Montevideo, Uruguay",Jul 2015,"Clear and warm water, white sand, a wide coast and a calm atmosphere is all you can expect from a beach to be your favorite. Nusa Dua is far from the busy streets of Kuta. You can stay in one of its beautiful but costly hotels and stay away from the busy Bali or just go for the day by taxi or hiring a personal driver. Must go when going to Bali. "
silvia-portugal,48 contributions,May 2016,"the water has a good temperature. there are trees to stay in the shadow. there are lots of chais where you can seat.there are beds where you can enjoy a massage. water sports are available like parasailing and others. a lot of cafes, bares and restaurants are there, also. the beach was clean, although there are some plastics in the water.in some places of bali, there is not a public service of collecting the garbage.for that reason, the plastic ends on the ocean and nobody cares about it. if you go to Bali, talk to the local people and tell them that you are worried about this issue."
Carol H,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",May 2016,"the beach was fairly clean when we visited,coarser sand, good for swimming,watersports,loungers out the front of the hotels on the sand,"
Haydz02,"Leppington, Australia",Apr 2016,"Nusa Dua Beach is by far the best we visited in Bali! Much better than Kuta, Seminyak and Dreamland.Nice and clean and not at all crowded. You also don't get bugged by locals trying to sell you stuff like you do at the other beaches listed above.Highly recommended to all!"
Selim T,6 contributions,May 2016,"The  resorts and location are great but the water and the beach aren t any close to white sandy beaches of Maldives, Seychelles or Mediterranean Sea ones"
Roving601758,8 contributions,Jan 2016,Nusa Dua is an ideal place for couples as well as singles who want to just unwind. The beach is beautiful with clear blue waters and Water sports. I would definitely recommend this destination. Looking forward to go back again 
LucasDize,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,"Nice Beach, a little dirty (organic stuff) when we went, but ok.Sandy bottom, that's really good, I guess it was the first beach that we went in Bali that is not filled with rocks..Water blow, just at side of the beach, is a must see."
Sabrology,"Cairo, Egypt",Nov 2015,"It's not a very nice beach, but it has a huge amount of activities do to such as: Parasailing, Ocean bed walking (you wear a helmet and walk on the bottom of the sea like ancient scuba gear), under water scooter, turtle island .. etc) "

samrox5,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,Enjoyed my time at this beach. Calmer than Potato Head. Nice sand & quite clean. Hired sun beds & enjoyed a good breeze & the squirrels provided entertainment. Food/drink available at the restaurant & toilets to.
Anita K,"Dunajska Streda, Slovakia",Apr 2016,"Very nice beach, cleaner than the beaches in Bali. The personal cleans it always. The ocean is amazingly blue, and we liked the low-tide also, when you can walk lot of meters in the ocean."
Jack S,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"I don't get what is the big deal about Nusa Dua and Seminyak beaches. If you are not a surfer, then the beaches are quite dull, not clean and smells!Any Sydney beach tops those beaches."
'Niteshwar K,50 contributions,May 2016,It's clean and maintained. I spend most of my day time at nusa dua Beach. You will find lots of tourists there. It's near to nusa resort. You will find people selling swimsuits and food items there. Kids playing on sand. Awesome view. And lots other water activities.
Lailacs,"Belo Horizonte, MG",May 2016,There are many beachs in bali much more beautiful than thisAnd it's not close to any nice placeIt's kind of isolated Nowhere to go at night except for the mall and the hotels restaurants
Marcus-Aurelius-Pro,"Chippenham, UK",Jun 2015,"The clear water and white sand beaches were really gourgeus. We only went for one day as there is so much to see in Bali, but I would definitely return. We hired a couple of jet ski for a relatively low price compared to other places in Bali"
José B,Portugal,May 2016,"The beaches in Nusa Dua are very good, they are everything you can expect from a beach.You can enjoy wonderful cafés or do a massage while you enjoy the sun. The water is always in a good temperature. You can choose to be on the shadow or on the sun. The only problem i found in Bali is the pollution. The non-touristic areas are full of plastics on the floor (the touristic areas are clean). Those plastics end going to the ocean (in the beach, you will see plastics on the water). If you go to Bali, tell the local people to preserve the ocean, by giving the plastic a proper treatment."
TravelingToast,"Greenville, SC",May 2016,"From where we were (Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa), we could see a volcano on Bali in the distance, and an island across from us (Nusa Penida??).  The water itself was a beautiful blue, but once inside was always full of debris (bits of plans or seaweed or so).  I really wasn't expecting that and was really disappointed.  Sometimes it was so bad you couldn't avoid touching it. No problem if you aren't bothered by that stuff.  Sometimes there was an occasional plastic bag or cup, but I guess that isn't uncommon at other beaches.The atmosphere on the beach was completely unrelaxing for us the first few days. I don't know if the people recognized we were new, but we were asked so frequently about purchasing something that I couldn't get any reading done.  Asking about a massage, purchasing items, jet ski rides, etc!  We read you should always smile and be polite in Balinese culture, but the minute we took time for a nice 'no thank you' they would ask other questions of what we wanted to buy.   There are trees that offered shade, very cool alternative to umbrellas. "
Yash Wadhwa,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2015,"Amazing, clean beaches with no.  Of options for Water Sport... Clear water and good assistance for any kind of water sports "
Debbra O,"Eidsvold, Australia",May 2016,"So much to look at with out the hussel n bussel.Beach can get strong. heavy tides so the scene changes all the time, you can walk on the beach or the paths the join the resorts.Check the Water blower out."

Jess L,"Arundel, Australia",May 2016,"A beautiful beach, picture perfect. Great for swimming especially if you have children. No big waves. When tides out you can walk in quite a distance. It is directly opposite all the nice hotels such as the Melia and Sofitel. It's not busy like the beaches in places like Kuta."
deemurray,"Gorey, Ireland",May 2016,The water was luke warm the beach was attended all day by staff who were constantly keeping it clean wish I was back there now

ganmeister,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is off a number of luxurious hotels. It is not as commercialized or crowded as other beaches and has nice soft sand with clear clean waters. 
Julia T,7 contributions,May 2016,"The architecture is beautiful. The breakfast spread not as varied but good enough. The beach is fantastic. It has small waves, very clear waters, round-shaped sand that looks like white pepper beads, lots of friendly tiny fishes that swim to the shoreline. There are also those fishes that nibble the dead cells off your body! Plenty of small seashells to collect. Very safe for children under 5. The beach pool is fantastic. It is shady, with sand to replicate a real ocean, shallow enough for the kids to roam safely, and lots of space for guests to swim with their kids. The kids club is simple but they have good activities lined up daily. The bedrooms are clean and comfy. The AC is very cold. The beds and bedding are top notch quality. The bathrooms have very strong water pressure and new fixtures. The toiletries are very complete and generous. It may not be as luxurious as Intercontinental or Grand Hyatt, but it really stands out as a family friendly place to spend with your kids. "
Cristian I,"Arad, Romania",May 2016,"I really enjoyed Nusa Dua Beach. Everything was nice, we received complimentary towels and were able to order cocktails and food at our location. Sun was very strong. If you're white, make sure to use lots of protection! The sea was perfect. All in all, this beach is worthy of your visit."
600nicholasf,"Worthing, UK",Apr 2016,"Uncrowded, no hassle from beach sellers. Some unwanted debris is washed up from around the coast but is cleaned up every day by the hotel beach cleaners"
pandt2013,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,Great at high tide at one end and good at low tide at the other end. Make sure you have a good resort pool to escape to so you can mix it up.
itspriyanka,"Hyderabad, India",May 2016,Its one of the cleaner and well maintained beaches in Bali. Its in the Nusa Dua area where most of the 5 star properties are located. Waves were not rough and it must be good for swimming too. We went before Devdan show so did not get into water though.There are many restaurants around too.
KirOla,Kristiansand,May 2016,"This is a very nice beach with lots of space and sunbeds. Some items floating in the water with the waves, but thats the only negative thing about the beach"
MahoutMal,"Sandringham, Australia",May 2016,Beach look great but water and sand covered in rubbish. Really disappointing. Hotels and local authorities really need to fix this problem or no one will want to go here.
Steve B,6 contributions,May 2016,"Lovely colours of water and the sand is white, although quite grainy. Very pleasant for swimming in the sheltered parts behind the breakers. Loved the kites as well!"
DandrevN,"Brits, South Africa",May 2016,"Very good holiday destination. Focusing on tourists and holiday vibes. There are many hotels in this location, which is a benefit as the shops or centres then collect shoppers from their hotel or close to the hotel for free and drop them off again at the hotel."
HungryFriend,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2016,"The last time we went here, there's been a paving path provided to go through from the parking lot (last time we must turn a bit and walk beside the stalls fnear parking lot).The beach are also cleaner but still, the walk to waterblow is a bit disapponting... There's still many garbage others throw around the green grass... Such a pity... Change your habit please... Do not litter..."
Sandra F,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2016,"Lovely beach .white sands.cleaned by hotel staff all along in front of many 5 star hotels (westin ,luguna, sofitel grand hyatt etc etc..safe to swim .."
Meherul M,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",May 2016,At first day I got upset to watch messy beach with small wave. And next day when I was there I feel like WoW with blue water white sandy beach. It was amazing
charusingh911,"Greater Noida, India",Apr 2016,"We were roaming about in Legion when we bumped into a guy with water sport packages. I bought a package for Jet Skiing, Banana Boat and Parasailing for 150k. He called for a cab that would take us to Nusa Dua where these were to happen. It took us an hour from Kuta to reach there. I ended up having the most fun-filled day ever. The guy from the water sports were kind enough to let me snorkel too!It was an absolutely fun time."
Alinom6,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,We stared at the Nusa dua beach hotel and spa and were very spoilt as the beach was cleaned and raked each morning. In other spots there was a lot of seaweed but still a really nice beach to relax on.
Ladyintheusa,"Javea, Spain",Jan 2016,Its a shame but its a cruise ship sort of place. Just aimed to take your money. Maybe a quiet time would be good but it was busy when we went
Linda W,"Kalamunda, Australia",Apr 2016,"great beach...the day we were there the water was beautiful, lovely and clean, great swimming beach. awesome.....definately must go to this beach."
Daniel H,"Madrid, Spain",May 2016,"Coming from Kuta we found this beach much nicer than the ones in seminyak, is clean in general nd not so crowded"
RLlance,7 contributions,Dec 2015,Very average beach coming from Australia. Especially during low tide with sea weeds showing. Sand was nice enough and great private restaurants and bars on the beach.
Lara C,9 contributions,May 2016,"The beach in Nusa Dua is so much nicer than kuta! Clean, white sand, clean water, clear water, plenty of water sports, surf."
rantati7,"Helsinki, Finland",May 2016,If you just stay in Nusa Dua you haven't seen Bali. And on the other hand seeing Nusa Dua and the beach especially at Grand Bali Hyatt is worth the trek. Beach is really nice at high tide and there are no waves here. But staying alone in Nusa Dua would bore me to death. 
zeitgeist_12,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,We stayed at several different locations and found all the beaches to be very inviting and exciting. Swimming there feels so much safer than the beaches we have in Australia .ie. sharks.We loved the beach the most that was adjacent to the Ayataya Hotel. We will be coming back. 
Rania N,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2016,We stayed there for 9 nights in Inaya outri hotel. Quiet and relaxing location. Bit boring for friends.
Dave M,Sydney,May 2016,access to this breach is from the few resorts face this beach. Depending on tie of day - there cab be strong waves and rips and weaker swimmers should stay close to shore
Nicola G,"Auckland, New Zealand",Apr 2016,"Walk early in the morning on this amazing beach, not crowded, Just super hot! The walk takes you to the Bali collection Shopping centre, you can do a full circle.  You may need to relax in some of the hotels for a drink along the way. But hey when you are in such an awesome setting what if it takes all day!"
Sherpa571767,58 contributions,May 2016,The was by far the best beach for swimming and relaxing. No high waves and clean beach.The beds and umbrellas belong to the high priced hotels but you can ask if you can rent them for one day. We had an umbrella and two beds for 150 000 rupiah ( originally 200 000 rupia) but there is also shade underneath the trees i guess you could also hang out there. The water was not too deep and you can easily swim there. Beeing there in May it was very quit and pleasant.In the evening the plastic started to show up which is a major problem anywhere in Asia.
BalistoChristo,Germany,Feb 2016,"Not as busy as Kuta. No stray dogs and the guys that try to sell you stuff on the beach have to register and are thus limited in number. Nice restaurants nearby. Very nice place to relax. Yet, this place is very touristic so if you are looking for authentic Bali you might be disappointed. "
PokeTraveller,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,"For me, this is the perfect beach area in Bali where many beautiful resorts are. The beach is not noisy and crowded. The water is so blue and sand is white. This is usually used for wedding and beaitiful decoration tho. One of the most beautiful resort is The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali where the white seats on the beach stands."
Alex Pichel,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2016,"I have spent a long weekend at the Grand Hyatt with the family and that beach was kept in perfect shape. Staff kept on cleaning the beach front, especially during low tide. There was no rubbish floating around and as there were no boats allowed either, there was no pollution. You were able to walk for miles and miles and if you wanted could stop at either the various hotels or bars along the beach."
KamilaSpk,11 contributions,May 2016,We stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali which was the best hotel where I've ever been. Nusa Dua is not for party people but if you wanna have an excellent service and relax then you can't be wrong over there.
Natal Surbakti,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Nusa dua beach is now became more and more busy, especially on week end , But its still worth it to visit . The wave is very calm, unlike the one in Semimyak or Kuta .."
georgiap340,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Supposedly the best beach in Bali. Yes it could have been that, with minimal surf but alas that is not the case. Mounds and mounds of rubbish dirty the beach both in the water and on the sand. Yes there are cleaners, quite a few of them actually who sweep the beach about mid morning, creating neat little piles of seaweed mixed with hard rubbish. but then what they end up doing is digging a shallow little hole right there on the shoreline and burying it!!! When the tide comes in, it all gets washed up again. We tried to swim and got sick with various skin conditions. We were very disappointed as the pictures are quite deceiving and do not give a good indication of the amounts of litter in the water. We are beach goers and took this vacation specifically to enjoy Mengiat Beach at Nusa Dua and not to just swim in a hotel pool. Very disappointing and we won't be going back."
Kristine V,"Grimstad, Norway",May 2016,its really lovely beach but with one but - it so sad to see how locals are trashing everywhere - plastic is on the beach and in the water. they have so beautiful nature!
lise275,"Toronto, Canada",May 2016,"The beach looks absolutely beautiful and the waves aren't too big or too strong for swimming. Unfortunately, once you're on the beach, you will see a lot of garbage. Although they clean the beach every day, there always seems to be garbage, sad because the beach is really beautiful. "
travellerathens76,Athens Greece,May 2016,"As there is an offshore reef, the beach is quite safe compared to other Bali beaches, but the currents can be strong sometimes and it gets relatively fast deep, so you only have a few meters to swim at and you have to be very careful especially if you have young children. Furthermore the tide can bring rubbish from the ocean but the beach cleaners are always on duty!  The sand is soft and beautiful with reddish undertones, the water is warm and fairly clear, there are only a few polite hawkers and the place is not overcrowded. The best spot for swimming is in front of Grand Hyatt hotel near the life guard. "
szkut,"Kincumber, Australia",May 2016,There are many parts to Nusa dua beach. Found Some parts can be better than others depending on wind and currents. The beach is ok for a swim but generally with some rubbish in the water. The beach is more know for its huge amount of big resorts rather than the beach itself.
ttoshi2013,"Fujisawa, Japan",May 2016,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt. From the hotel pool, almost no distance to the beach. In the morning, we could see a beautiful sunrise scene at the beach. I saw the hotel clening team was cleaning-up the beach side. This is the reason why the beach is so beautiful. There was a sign ""No life guard on duty, swiming is at your risk"", I saw a few people were in the see."
Yanuar A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"The beach was clean, with a lot of hot babes around. Walking pavement was well maintained. A lot of security guards could be found in the area, so you will feel safe. Generally a pleasant place to get lazy and laid-back."
Rinat M,"Moscow, Russia",Apr 2016,"Nice beach to swim, waves are not big, comfortable clean bottom. There are some seaweed in the water and on the beach, but not everyday and staff cleans the beach. Convenient if you just want to swim and sunbathe."
42pal,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"My wife and I (74,71) visited Nusa Dua Beach and were attracted to a beach lounge which we sat upon .Within 1 minute we were asked to leave or pay a fee. We left and sat upon a TREE TRUNK and as we were told the property was owned by the Grand Hyatt hotel-so once again we were asked to leave,so we went to the air conditioned Bali Connection shopping centre."
Abby Marcel,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"Stayed just for a short business trip and pushed my self to spare the time for running along the beach. It was nice and safe. Though the crowd is moderate, the running path and its safetiness is satisfying. The best time to start running is at 04.30 PM to 19.00 PM. My starting point was Nikki beach and ended at Hilton hotel."
Karl z,"Rowville, Australia",May 2016,Warm blue crystal clear water. Beware sometimes of strong currents. Go for a walk along nusa dua beach to see some magnificent resorts.
Donna P,"West Hollywood, CA",Jul 2015,Love walking along this beach morning and sunset even after sunset the beachwalks amazing. You can walk into most resorts from the beach especially ones with beachfront bars.
uaremysonshine,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,Nusa Dua is a wonderful safe and relaxed area for a family holiday. We ventured into Seminyak for a day and were quite overwhelmed with how busy and commercial it was. In Nusa Dua we felt completely comfortable to wander along without any hassles. The water & beach in front of Sofitel and alot of the resorts was kept clean and nice for times spent at the beach. Lots of restaurants along the beachfront to try out when wanting to venture outside your resort. 
gtbridge,19 contributions,Apr 2016,"Went for a swim with 6, 8 & 14 year olds. Lovely clear sand. Private beach with our hotel. Nice views left and right. Huge waves outer reef and on shore. Lots of rips. Whitewash knocked kids over. Didn't stay long."
depti70,"Darwin, Australia",May 2016,"I went to this beach today and not a plastic bottle or piece of seaweed in sight.  It was hot, quite unseasonal for first day of May.   As usual when I come here perfect.  Warungs in the neighborhood the best places to eat off the beaten track.  I will eat again and find out the address so I can review.   Best day."
hengkysouisa,"Malang, Indonesia",Apr 2016,"Swim in a clear water in the early morning just perfect. the beach is not crowded, white sand, sun shining. many high end Hotels have their private beach there."
Alessandro R,"Verona, Italy",May 2016,"We been to nusa dua beach for experience water sport, we areived and make us to seat down and talk on prices and activities. We took 2 water sports for 750k rupia, Jetsky and dive(no licence needed). Because we all were at the first experience the dive was about 15minits at maximum 10mt of depth. Jetsky was just mutch fun, you are always followed by someone that make sure you don't exeed in crazy. Compare to the price in europe and Australia  was cheap and we had great fun, bad point of the experience were 2:~long contracting 1 hour about~really dirty water with alot of rubbishAnyway i suggest the experience!!!"
Rajesh S,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,"With young kids here is a secret revealed - beach Nusa Dua which we found when we checked into Westin .. It is one of the safest , quietest because beaches are absolutely private and you are not disturbed by hawkers etc .. You can rent bikes , walk to a very nice shopping area full of nice restaurants and all kind of shops and a Sogo store .. You can fine at more than 20?options by the beach restaurants and bars operated by all the hotels , you can walk out side Nusa Dua estate and enjoy the local flavor .. It is an ideal place for conferences , marriages or just simple vacations and the area is very safe in the night due to police presence all over the place and restricted entry into the estate .. But the beach area has a different character anytime of the day or night and chafes beautifully as the day progresses .. Children are very safe as hardly any outsider is allowed or slips through the security .. It is simply most beautiful among the bestest beaches  in the world with added Indonesian Balinese hospitality which is amazingly rare to find .."
Karim S,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2015,so much money paid to swim with plastic bottles and bags and dirt Vietnam beaches are cleaner just sad
Sue C,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,Be careful swimming in beach as strong undertow. Not busy with tourists. Enjoyed the Bali collection outlet.
Elaine C,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"The club room lounge is very nice lovely breakfast , afternoon teas & best of all cocktails between 5.30pm & 7pmThe staff work so hard to make your stay very special"
Juanita H,"Ballina, Australia",Apr 2016,"I found this beach to be the cleanest   Ive been to in bali, we had alot of fun doing watersports and didnt get hassles to buy anything, could walk along it peacefully. Water wasnt thay deep but nice on a hot day. Lots of places to eat around. Worth checking out!"
jeb1969,"Las Vegas, NV",Apr 2016,"Gorgeous waters, amazing views and rather calm waters make this a great sunning and swimming beach area for families or couples alike.  Stunning views. Hyatt Bali has exclusive rights to much of this beach. "
Talitha M,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",Apr 2016,"Not the best beach, it looks gorgeous and the water isn't too cold. But there's lots of seaweed. There's men that clean it off the beach all day, but it's still there and in the sea itself. Lots of boats and watersports so fun to look at. But you can only swim within the ropes. "
Omaca69,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"Maintained by the staff of the beach front hotels, this beach is safe (due to the offshore reef), clean and quiet compared to Seminyak, Legian & Kuta."
irene t,60 contributions,Jan 2016,"If you looking for some more privacy. You can find in nusa dua. The beach is clean. Because kuta now its so crowed and in my opinion alot of trash now. Nusa dua more quite, suitable to babies and family. You can relax with no worries."
Su G,"Mexico City, Mexico",May 2015,"Really clean and calm beach, yiu can get into the sea, nice views and the best colors of the sea. No noise or garbage."
Cj C,419 contributions,Apr 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is great for activities but not for swimming. To be honest I can only talk for the section of beach out the front of the major hotel area and it's possible there are better parts of the beach, but today I did parasailing over the water and it was full of weeds, algae blooms and rocks. Not ideal for swimming. However there is lots of water sports for cheap prices. And the sun rises are beautiful"
Gwen M,"Charlotte, NC",Apr 2016,"Love this beach! Mainly because you can walk or ride bikes along the whole length with beach on one side- resorts on other. Many of the resorts have awesome various types of seating right on the sand, along with a variety of great restaurants.  They have the usual boating activities too. But we just loved watching the sun rise and relaxing while reading. Only negative was the constant locals trying to sell usual junk or boat rides."
Texonesian,"Dallas, TX",Jul 2015,"This place is not particularly special, when compared to some of the more extraordinarily beautiful beaches in less-known locations all around Indonesia... But for some odd reason, Bali really outstanding at marketing itself as some sort of paradise. If you are high maintenance, then you will probably like it more, because it's not isolated from civilization, and you don't have to challenge yourself in any way. It's not even remotely exotic, and has mostly lost any charm that it may have once had. But it doesn't suck, entirely. It's just very touristy, so if that's your thing - it will make you happy. So if you enjoy traveling to far away places, and only seeing other people from your own country, then this is where you should holiday. It's safe vanilla."
hussainalizadeh,"Pecs, Hungary",Apr 2016,I had a great experience. I just recommend more cleaning of beach. Extremel friendly people. I highly recmmend it to everyone 
Frank R,11 contributions,Apr 2016,Make sure there are plenty people eating in restaurants before you go in as its very quite here. We have been to 4 other restaurants in this are this trip and food was no problem. 
Wilson T,13 contributions,Jan 2016,Nusa Dua was the best beach we visited in Bali. Many small resturaunts and food vendors to please your tastebuds. Lots of shady trees to give you a rest from the heat while you eat or just rest.Just be aware of No swimming on religious and public holidays holidays. 
Zeynep,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Feb 2016,It was very hot there compared ro any other place i had visited. It has a bad compost smell. The beach is average A great place to stay away from all the busy hussle
Suyash Thakur,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",Apr 2016,awesome neighbourhood filled will fantastic hotels and lovely street shopping areas. Try the newly opened Ritz Carlton!!
beckiegirl,Deep Cove Nova Scotia,May 2015,Great beach to walk on and have a swim.  Cleaner than most beaches in Bali. I stayed at the Sheraton Nusa Dua so gained beach access from that location.
LSJ,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Nusa Dua is mainly a private beach with many commercial uses. Most of the water sports are held here which makes it a very touristy place to visit. Unless you have your hotel which gives you the private beach space it would be more enjoyable. A suggestion is to book a hotel along the beach to enjoy this scenic view that no one has.
Jeffrey G,"Carlsbad, CA",Apr 2016,"Cleanest beaches we've been to so far.Manicured daily, no trash. The water is fairly clear and  and very few people trying to sell stuff to you. "
superspyuk,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2016,"It's quite clean, quiet, surrounded by the beautiful resorts. But not quite for surfing I guess, not wave not strong enough."
ajayshah2015,"San Jose, CA",Apr 2016,Loved this beach - more pristine than others in bali. The waves are bigger at the reef for those who like surf compared to the milder kuta beach.  I really enjoyed the waves although care is required. 
terry p,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,I would definitely say that without a doubt Nusa Dua is the cleanest beach in Bali (that we've seen anyway) with beautiful white sandy beaches and very clean ocean water.
shezazle23,103 contributions,Apr 2016,We had heard great things of Nusa Dua beach but was terribly disappointed. Our resort backed onto the beach so was lovely to view from far away. My husband and I went for a walk down the beach and decided to walk up further as there looked to be more people swimming. We had to pretty much dodge the rubbish and seaweed to get out quite deep and into a clear spot for swimming. We lasted about five minutes swimming and decided to get out as the rubbish really did put us off. The beach is a real disgrace and I will not be recommending to anyone :(
WWDreamer,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,The beach was very close to our hotel. Both the beach itself and the water were quite clean. Nice sand yet not at all crowded. 
Byron S,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,"The beach is one of the better ones in Bali.Some parts have a very strong current that can push you along with really knowing it.Still issue with rubbish around the place and in water - some marine life is dodgy.Sand is OK for the area.Admittedly I am from Western Australia - that has some of the best beaches in the world - so I may have high, but simple, standards."
Mohammed A,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2016,"So lovely, an amazing place and would make sure I keep on coming to this super beautiful side of Bali, "
Bridget M,Melbourne,Mar 2016,"The beach is wide here but gives the impression of being dirty, as does the ocean.  I'm not sure if this is really the case or not but I'd definitely not go swimming here."
Inderarani Prem... N,"JHB, South Africa",Mar 2016,We Visited the Factory where Silver is actually made wow do these people have time & total dedication.The Coffee plantation was exciting as some type of  of animal pooh is used to make the rarest coffee lol i refused to taste it bought the Coconut one instead 
radumoldovan,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Apr 2016,"excellent beach, palm trees and banyan tree provide much needed shade, there's a reef nearby, aporx 400 m at sea.watch the low and hight tide."
briangdav,"Stonehouse, Scotland, United Kingdom",Apr 2016,Problems with tides bringing in seaweed and rubbish. Not for swimming as also has problems with sea urchins. 
Melissa A,"Takehara, Japan",Mar 2016,"I didnt get a full view of the beaches.  Aron Bali cettainly made sure we knew where to go and the places to visit while there.  So, I give Aron a 10.  The beaches, not sure... Some in Seminyak seemed much nicer. "
Glenjando,5 contributions,Apr 2016,Definitely worth taking the family to nusa dua Bali collection pica tapas restaurant really enjoyable selection of food 
SonnyCash1,"London, United Kingdom",Apr 2016,"The beech is very relaxing. It loses a star due to the noise and smell of jet skis and motor powered boats.As it is in a bay, the paranomic view is fantastic. The negative of being in a vat is the lack of hypnotic crashing waves. We went in April and there was a history breeze which was magnificent in keeping us cool in 33 degree temperatures.There were only a few vendors who were not too in your face. "
Mark K,"Perth, UK",Apr 2016,"Read reviews about dirty beaches and Too many hawkers, to be fair in any tourist resort you will find both if that's what your looking for, we found the hawkers friendly and a polite no thanks always worked of we didn't want to deal, beaches around our hotel was spotless, further down towards the collection it did have some rubbish coming in with the the tide but nothing that bad to warrant a panic attack, miles of beautiful walks from benoa to the cliffs. "
warren280,"Cobden, Australia",Apr 2016,My wife and I were staying locally and a quick walk had us to the lovely beach. We went in the morning for the sun rise and it was terrific! The beach cleaners were on duty and the place was a place of beauty. We didn't get hassled too much by beach vendors. A massage was available if needed. The cleanest beach I've seen for quite some time.
3clems,"East Maitland, Australia",Apr 2016,The beaches were very beautiful & clean.  Crisp blue water & not freezing cold like in Australia.   The temperature was just right.
Lisa H,"Cairns, Queensland, Australia",Mar 2016,"Lovely beach...very white sand, a lot of resorts front on to this beach so have private areas...lovely to have lunch and watch the world go by"
latinafamily,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"Maybe its because we are from western Australia that I give this beach an average score, to me it is ordinary and not worth the trip unless you are staying there. Sanur beats it hands down."
lovetotravel423,"Emerson, NJ",Apr 2016,Beach was nice and well maintained.We were at The Mulia and just so refreshing and nice watching the sunrise early morning.The water is clear and warm.Love it.
MoshieMo,206 contributions,Apr 2016,This beach is great for young families to swim. Gentle waves ease access. Only tourists. No shade on the beach. Close to restaurants. Beautiful to look at. A swim in your hotel pool would be just as fun.
reneemarbella,"Marbella, Spain",Apr 2016,"The sand is nice and the water temperature is amazing.The only problem we found is that the water was not clean, too many papers and plastic bags"
Gazal P,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"The beach is clean, I ddint see any jellyfish etc though we had been warned bout them. Weddings take place here as well, making it look even more beautiful"
Moha29,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",May 2015,"this is a really beautiful beach , high wave and clean sand . just take a walk around the beach because there are many spots you should visit."
Smart_traveller_russia,"Moscow, Russia",Apr 2016,"If you come to Bali and decided to go on a beach, that's good one in Bali, but still the worth one vs. Maldives and Bahamas. you can try to find ocean clean in a morning (before 11 am, after that it become dirty (with leaves and trees) "
losakos,"Loma Linda, CA",Mar 2016,Came here so my husband could surf. Water was warm and beautiful. I laid on the sand with book and was as happy as could be!
Nim S,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"If your hotel have access to the beach, this is a good place to hang out to avoid too many people. You can swim without bumping with other people but I found that some area needs to be separated with small boat. We access the public beach and a lounge will cost you AUD2.50 but our hotel gave us voucher so we did not pay."
nebojsa J,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Nusa Dua is most preferable less crowded area in Bali, perfect for nice peaceful  relaxing holidays with scent of tropical luxury huge resorts in area especially made for people  who enjoy to spoil them self with high standards services ..."
OnHols5,London,Apr 2016,The water has loads of seaweed and the tide goes in the afternoon. Go to another beach if you can. The sand is rough and the stones can hurt your feet
finleydinley,BNEAust,Apr 2016,"Love Nusa Dua beach, it is safe for families with children and you have the convenience of the shopping precinct ""Bali Collection"" close by. "
11112011,65 contributions,Apr 2016,"After sea storm a lot of rubbish in the sea. The waves are high, making it impossible to swim with kids. Had to stay most of the time by the pool due to that"
Christij,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"This is a lovely beach and when we were there which was recently the beach was fairly quiet, but their can be quite a few rips, so you need to be careful of going out too far.  It can be a bit deceptive as it looks so tranquil.   "
The Slow Traveller,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Mar 2016,Loved strolling along the beach in Nusa Dua. The sand doesn't stick like it does in Goa. Clear blue water. And it isn't crowded. 
alchemistress,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"One of the best beaches in Bali to swim in. Various groundskeepers keep the beach pristine and tourists value this by being clean also. The water is beautiful, almost warm with a bit of swell and waves and is an amazing soft turquoise blue. There is a strong under current at dawn and dusk, but the beach is patrolled by lifesavers. "
Alanatmernda01,"Mernda, Australia",Mar 2016,"Water warm and clear around 32 degrees. Relatively calm and extremely enjoyable. Because the waves break about 200 metres out the swell coming into shore are moderate and the water is clear, warm and the sand below is visible. We swam in the ocean on most days and apart from minimal wisps of seaweed the water was free from any type of pollution."
DaveR,"Como, Australia",Apr 2016,"A lovely white sanded beach where you can pay 25,000 for each deckchair with umbrella or sit on the beach. The water is beautiful and clear, do be mindful of a strong curent that pulls along the beach.Take your snorkeling gear as there are lots of fish swimming in the reeds, Nemo was down there too.Keep an eye out for the local fishermen who are in search of squid. Amazing they wear a life jacket and literally float out in the depths for their catch...a different technique.Dont forget your sunscreen,  we also took our own esky full of Bintang with ice to the beach from our villa...saved a few bucks.Not too busy in April or too hot, great time to go to Bali."
kjell m,"Subic, Philippines",Apr 2016,"We went here from Legian and we have hope it had been better. Here is more quiet and the beach is more calm, but it get very fast deep here, so you only have a few meters to swin at"
fran l,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"The beach is nice, very busy atmosphere around the beach.Found the park surroundings had a lot of rubbish laying around"
t_parker400,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Loads rubbish in sea hotel staff do best to clean but keeps washing in , nappies bottles all plastic  we were forever coming out of sea with handfuls of rubbish to put in bins all sea here is like it been all round island same problems"
mkatyan,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Mar 2016,Beach isn't very well maintained. There were lot of weeds in the area. However the sea is shallow here and that was a totally different experience.
TIersHasie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,Nusa Dua beach is a much more prestine beach - but all the beaches South Bali are.This one isn't the best but is the most commercialised and easiest to access. Prices are a bit costly here but the facilities and service is the best. The best restaurants and bars nearby compared to the other beaches south bali which are a lot more idyllic.A little bit more rubbish too due to high traffic.Maybe walk further down to Geger or further South or East for quieter nicer beaches.
amdkr,"Pune, India",Mar 2016,This one is very calm and no waves... its good for walk and relax but for beach fun not so good. Mengiat beach near to this one is better.
Craig O,"Swindon, UK",Feb 2016,"Warm, clear water great for swimming inside the reef and consistent clean waves outside. Surfers dream!  Just not accessible an hour either side of low tide.  "
thuramshan,"Chatswood, Australia",Mar 2016,"We stayed at The Bale Resort and they have a private section on the beach so it was just us and a couple of visitors. Sand is clean and soft, water is super clear. We didn't go to other beaches around (except the Jimbaran which is definitely suitable for dinning ONLY...) so can't compare but this one is really nice."
i_arin,"Noida, India",Jan 2016,Nice relaxing beach for a quite walk or lie down in one of the shades (rented). There are quite a few options of bar on the beach side. the view of the clear water is just amazing.
Bruno R,"Miami, FL",Mar 2016,Definitely a beach to visit with great scenery and a nice walk all along. You can stop to have a drink at any of the hotel on the way too. 
Eli,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Not sure why this is considered one of the best beaches, I agree it's beautiful to see, but the water is full of garbage!! I walked along the beach across several hotels and mostly it's the same. Staff from the hotels constantly clean the beach from seaweed, but the problem is the garbage. Shame!! Apart from this, very quiet place."
AidaBlatPalacios,Singapore,Mar 2016,"Fantastic beach. Cleaner after the Grand Hyatt. Unfortunately you can see how us, humans, are polluting the see with plastic bottles, bags, cups, etc. The cleaners try hard, but there is too much waste in the see coming to shore :("
woojin2016,"Beverly Hills, CA",Feb 2016,"Unlike Kuta or Semynak beach, this place is very quiet to walk, having some thoughts. Smooth white sand is another good things."
Ratna Komala,"Ubud, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"I never get tired with bali beach, always fun and relaxing. I got quite nice beach club it called agendaz. Its nice because they don't have any minimum order to sit there as long as we want. The price was reasonable with nice service. "
WendygAustralia,Australia,Mar 2016,Beautiful clean and inviting when staying in one of the 5 star resorts along the beach. Many small resturaunts and food vendors to please your tastebuds. Lots of shady trees to give you a rest from the heat while you eat or just rest.Just be aware of No swimming on religious and public holidays holidays. 
Glenn C,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2016,"Great beach, but not much around in terms of restaurants, except for some of the hotels which tend to be a bit overpriced."
Shridhar_Jaju,"Yavatmal, India",Mar 2016,"Nusa Dua was the best beach we visited in Bali. It had a line of high end resorts on one side, some excellent restaurants, shopping mall and water sport centers all along the beach.The cleanliness was excellent and the waters looked beautiful and blue. It was calming and peaceful just to be at the beach."
ATWHK,"Oakland, CA",Apr 2015,"Bali has lots of beautiful beaches, but most of them are not suitable for swimming. This is one of the few exceptions. You CAN go swimming there (and not just work on your tan). There are lots of hotels lining the ocean and a shopping mall nearby with great boutiques and excellent restaurants."
LetiBugi,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Low tide, white sands, not too crowded. One of the best beach to spend with kids. Try the bay area of nusa dua beach in the morning."
Seetalusha,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,Beautiful pristine beach. Great for the kids as well. It is definitely a must go place in Nusa Dua. Make sure you indulge in water sports.
Kim W,"North Reading, MA",Mar 2016,"I was on the part of the beach where it's half resort, half public. The water is very clear & was cooler than the water at Jimbaran Beach. White sand, but lots of shell bits so wear flip flops. Very calm waters so it would be great for kids. Definitely need an umbrella as it gets very hot. "
Badr A,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Sep 2015,"at least from the hotel side (The Laguna, a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Nusa Dua, Bali, Nusa Dua) the sea is too far from the beach to swim "
Tanya M,"Barcelona, Spain",Mar 2016,"Putrid, rubbish everywhere. Not swimmable at all when it is low tide. Rubbish on the beach and way out into the ocean. It is disgraceful. The resorts clean there own little sections of sand where their guests could sit, but what an awful view. To be fair, i didn't see when the tide was up,could look nicer. But I wouldn't set foot in there either way after seeing it."
ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Feb 2016,"This beach is resort territory. So expect white sands, crystal clear waters, and few fellow beachgoers, save for the occasional family on holiday. Not much in the way of snorkeling, but it's a great place to relax and work on that suntan."
Allen,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"For me, Nusa Dua Beach is the most beautiful beach in Bali. You can take photos from a lot of side. ""Nusa"" means island, and ""dua"" means two. So, ""Nusa Dua"" means two islands, because there is two little islands which sticky with Bali Island. "
wina95,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"Good Beach for relaxing and Quite beach, good for swimming and walking. very recommended this place for relaxing"
Karthik A,19 contributions,Mar 2016,Beach is more for watersport only. The shore is piled with rubbish and oil slicks. Sadly the neighbouring resorts do not bother much to do something about it. Nusa Dua is like a private area but the beach is being left alot to desire for.
jajubabu,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Jan 2016,"It's a beautiful Southern Beach Peninsula in Bali surrounded by luxury resorts. It's also an all inclusive tourist destination with a golf course, convention center,  shopping mall and other facilities. The golden - white sandy beach is safe and sterile. Geger beach is open to public. Enough water sports activities such as parasailing or  available nearby. Balinese massage and spa packages is another attraction. Eat , relax and sleep. It's safe and secure !"
Megan W,4 contributions,Mar 2016,"Lovely beach, not too many tourists or pollution. Clear waters. A little bit of surf. Wear sun cream though ☀️😅 short walk to heaps of restaurants and Bali collection."
Blibalitrans,"Nusa Dua Peninsula, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"is acctually if you want visit the clean beach,nusa dua is good choice and also we can have a relax there because is also quiet beach,and dont forget also to visit the waterblow inside nusa dua beach."
SK13000,"London, UK",Mar 2016,If your looking for white sand and clear water then this is the beach to visit. It's really quiet too so you can find a nice quiet spot for the whole day without being bothered by people trying to sell you things. There's some cool beach bars along there too where you can buy drinks & food but I would definitely take a picnic with you - we went in a beach bar and the food was expensive and really small portions 
David Germaine D,3 contributions,Mar 2016,Nice to take pictures also at the water blow! :) nice waves. Nice to see if you have a bicycle. Alot of restaurant to see! :)))
Jana J,78 contributions,Feb 2016,Clean and quiet. There are areas where people are playing volleyball but for the most part there are very few people
OzKK,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean, white sand and enjoyable. Up along the beach there are various water sports - parasailing, jet skis, and so on to enjoy also"
swamprat96,"Gosford, Australia",Mar 2016,Its a beautiful setting which the resorts really look after. Water quality is of course an issue- don't open your mouth!
James C,"Welby, Australia",Mar 2016,"Much cleaner than the beach on Gili island off Lombok, but still enough rubbish in the tidal areas on the sand to make me nervous about running on the sand bear footed. This is even on the beach in front of the Ayodya Resort."
olbap1976,"Lanzarote, Spain",Apr 2015,"This place is amazing, surrounded by turquoise water and flanked by an astonishing temple. There is a left hander for surfing but it's very frequented by locals."
thomasgJ5834KW,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2016,"Nice and clean with white water sand, its very nice beach in bali. I have go sun shine there with bitang beer , very lelax"
arunkumar d,"Stanwell, UK",Feb 2016,"Beautiful Beach , good for family, Less crowded , you can try private beach Nusa Dua Beach for more privacy. Nice view. Good to take photos."
Raluca B,"Tel Aviv, Israel",Sep 2015," The best beaches in Bali, great experience, lovely weather, clean water and really nice hotels located on the beach.                                                                    "
dasher007,"Mangalore, India",May 2015,Not great.Some watersport activities were present.The person who was coordinating the para sailing was a low life racist who was treating indians very bad and using slang words.Dint enjoy the place and the people.Avoid.
Yana R,59 contributions,Dec 2015,"Visited the Nusa Dua beach and it is definitely well maintained. It is also heavily guarded; you have to get through the guard booth just to drive into the beach area and there were guards walking around the beach area everywhere. It's a family-friendly beach with numerous accommodation lining up the beach front. We spoke to one of the water-sports personnel at the beach and took the boat to another part of the beach where we did parasailing, flying fish and jetski. It might not seem like so, but prices for the water sports is actually negotiable; depending on your charm level. I wasn't confident controlling the jetski on my own so I requested for a staff to sit behind me as ""backup"" and they readily did. We spent a long time trying out the various water sports and ended up with a great time!"
acaanil09,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,"Nice beach in a quite area. perfect if you are looking to just relax. however, not as happening and lively as you would find in Kuta."
Nkane,"Charlotte, NC",Feb 2016,"I've read a few bad reviews of this beach and while it is not Anguilla, it is beautiful. I spent a full day at this beach and must say that I was surprised at how clean this beach really is. The sand is clean and the water is clean as well. I paid attention to people and watched them throw bottles and garbage right down around them. The good thing is the people who work here take full notice and pick up the garbage right away. There are guys that come and clean as much seaweed out of the water as possible. I really can't complain or have anything negative to say about this beach and would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. "
Ryan O,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2016,"Clean beach, great to relax. It is better to visit in low tide as the beach isn't as rough and you can do snorkelling in the area "
Martyn L,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Superb! It provides privacy, high quality villas but it's beach is a weakness - long, boring walk - and with such brilliant in-resort facilities who needs a moderate beach anyway??!"
Mal J,"London, United Kingdom",Feb 2016,Nice beach slightly spoiled by people selling their goods but that's what I've come to expect.  Just very annoying when they are so persistent.
Joaniebond,london,Mar 2016,"Really liked Nusa dua, lovely people, nice restaurants........................ Shops nearby within waking distance.Near airport and resorts nice."
Juliek101045,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2016,If you are holidaying with little kids then this is a great beach as very calm bay. Nice sitting watching sunset from a beanbag on the sand. Very sheltered bay. 
Mike M,"Maroochydore, Australia",Mar 2016,"We stayed at the Ayoda hotel for 1 week and it was excellent. The sun beds are right on the beach and the sand is soft and white. The water is crystal clear in the mornings and can be a little cloudy by the afternoon (I would say due to the tides/swell). The beach is kept very clean, and well maintained. There are little to no waves on the beach, which offer amazing swimming, even for the most novice swimmers. Will definitely be back in the not to distant future. "
Anita1211,"New Delhi, India",Mar 2016,Beautiful sea and surroundingsActivities like parasailing...motorboatWater skiing..And relaxingIt's clean and it's not crowded so you can just sit and hear your thoughts...peaceful
Smrjoy,"Izmir, Turkey",Mar 2016,"Nusa dua beach is just for water sports. For surfers this place would be awesome. If you dont want to do water sports, I think you should go to geger beach. "
John W,"Cambridge, Canada",Mar 2016,The beach is beautiful to look at and walk on.  The week we spent there the water was calm everyday and the water was clear and very warm.  Only a few locals out selling their wares and they generally moved on once you said no thank you.
deepti0205,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,"Its a bit quiet beach and very peaceful and cal,. If you are looking for lot of water activity then you will not find that here. But other than that the water and the location is really beautiful. "
PA Deepak,"Visakhapatnam, India",Jan 2016,This is the most pleasant Beaches in Bali Ive ever seen and its so calm .Thes good bars and restaurants surrounding the Pleasant Beach.Ive tried even the Scuba Diving which thrilled me to its Best.This location is second time caller for tourists.
Jimman,63 contributions,Apr 2015,Nusa dua beach was quite big. Very graphical beach was lots of surfers. There were also placea were you could rent a board or even a sup and play around. Plenty of beach bars/cafes to have a cool drink or a snack
Steve C,"Sanur, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is really inviting for a swim. The sand is pure white and the water crystal clear with that amazing tropical blue colour out deep. We went there for the day and wanted to swim at a certain place but were told that as we weren't guests at the adjacent Hotel we were unable to use that section of the Beach. The public section of the Beach is still OK for swimming but a little shallow. Prices are of course higher than in Sanur or Kuta but that's the nature of the place - luxury hotels and great restaurants (with private beaches apparently).
Beth M,"Wellington, New Zealand",Feb 2016,"The beach here was beautiful and good for scuba diving however the surrounding bars and restaurants are more expensive than we found elsewhere - clearly aimed for the richer tourists, in particular the mall across the road. We did enjoy getting away from the noise of Kuta however and enjoyed the quiet peacefulness in wandering around the local area"
DeborahMello,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2016,"Great beach! Best way to enjoy is staying in one of the big resorts as the public areas are just average.Bali Collection is great, specially if you are after a one stop shop."
Love_Life_Sydney,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Sections had flags and life guards patrol. At low tide, in the evenings, it is very shallow and you could swim quite far out. High tide waves was quite strong. Saw people snorkelling. Lots of little places that served local food"
A M,Indonesia,Feb 2016,"Did stay at Westin and visited this beach several times. Overall clean and tidy, not white but fine."
Hsinchu_TaiwanDawa,"Hsinchu, Taiwan",Oct 2015,"I usually go through by the entrance hind the Bali theatre, where really nice start to start the wonderful ocean view and sidewalk along 5 stars hotels around.Very safe and calm beach, Around 10am, ppl get up and ready to swim and read, its enjoy place and quiet. Go further you can walk to a huge worrier status park, lush and clean park, a rock wrote in Chinese latter but cant understand. I had a great memories at Nusa Dua beach, don''t forget to bring hat and sun scream if you wanna walk through to Tanjung Benoa.(it's workable and acceptable) Hot Bali!!"
Loveatfoodsight,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2016,"Its a perfect place to sit back, relax and unwind. The beach is nice and clean and the water is warm with gentle currents. Perfect for taking a dip. You can also try beach kayaking which is fun. If you are tired, just rent out a beach mat and relax under the sky. Eateries around the place can be quite expensive so carry refreshments and your Bintang from stores outside the beach. Also, try to visit the Nusa Dua Garden of Hope which is just next to the beach."
Chris H,昆山市,Jan 2016,"not so many people. very clean water for swimming. the hotels there were quite good, i just love to stay there for two or three hour reading a book!!"
Erica C,"Hobart, Australia",Jul 2015,It's probably the most beautiful beach in Bali but unfortunately not my style because EVERYTHING is Western. Why travel to Bali if you want it to look and feel like the Gold Coast?It's also a loooonnngg way from Seminyak where all the best restaurants are.
jheather,brighton,Feb 2016,"very nice beach, wide and sandy, clean beach, especially liked the trees so you could sit in the shade. less rubbish in teh water than on a west coast."
Florence H,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Dec 2015,"We were there in Dec 2015.  Wished we had allocated more time to this beach.  Our hotel was not sea facing but provided shuttle service to an area of this beach which has been partitioned off for selected hotels.The beach was clean with an amazing variety of seaweed.  I have never seen so many kinds of seaweed within the same beach!As this beach is a private one, it was well maintained.   The kids had a great time.Will be back for sure."
Nikki C,"Williamstown, Australia",Feb 2016,"Lovely clean beach, but look out for sea urchins. Happy that the locals selling on the beach seemed to be monitored. Didn't feel hassle.  "
SigitaPP,"Riga, Latvia",Dec 2015,"The beaches are cleaned by the hotels, so they are really well kept. The best in Bali! Very long (at least 2 km) nice walking promenade-path by the ocean- especially at night!"
Genevieve P,"Kingston, Canada",Feb 2016,"We were so disappointed, shocked and in disbelief every time we would go to any beaches in Bali until we discovered Nusa Dua! This is the only beach where you see staff cleaning the beaches from debris, pollution and vegetation. This is the only area where we went swimming in the ocean. No plastic and other rubbish floating all over or washed up on shore. Mid to high end hotels on this beach or a enjoy for the day by entering beach at public access, rent a chair, food and beverage also available and most hotel resort restaurants are open to the public also..We were told by many that the reason the most beaches are so polluted is due to raining season washing all garbage into ocean...ok...maybe they should learn to discard plastic and glass properly so that it is not all over the place and would not get all washed down during rainy season..??"
Marcoregotz,"Zurich, Switzerland",Feb 2016," I checked in at the Mulias on the 11th Feb for a 3 nights stay. I booked through Leading Hotels of the World (LHW). The day I was to check in I sent an email to the hotel requesting a smoking room. I was confused to be informed that, by Indonesian law, no smoking was allowed on the property of any hotel (I have been staying in several hotel and resort properties both in Jakarta and Bali which all offered abundant accommodations for smokers in all outdoor areas, including private balcony's and terraces.). Additionally, no mention of their property being smoke-free was listed on their LHW page at the time of my bookingFurthermore, the duty manager, Mr. Falimra Kalmi, advised me that their resort was the only 6 star property in Indonesia, regardless of the fact that no hotel can be awarded more than five stars.   This '6 star' property was mostly decorated with obviously artificial flowers both in the room as well as public spaces.  Everywhere I turned there was signage warning guests of which activities were forbidden. While it's common hotel courtesy to be excused from a contract if an arriving guest does not find the property to be of his expectations, the duty manager absolutely refused to give any type of refund at all whatsoever. By the second day my loathing of this property made it impossible to stay anylonger, so I cut my losses and left."
baghdadpilgrim,"Grantham, UK",Feb 2016,"The beach was clean, the sea was warm and clear. Not too many vendors trying to sell their wares. Plenty too keep your attention if you enjoy watching the activities happening in the sea, plenty of watersports happening all around. Definitely worth a visit"
Malcolm B,"Carlisle, UK",Feb 2016,"A beautiful white sanded (when dry) beach, quite long and foes have private areas for some of the more swanky hotels.  There are public toilets that are quite basic but kept very clean and tidy and a number of restaurants to eat at - the food is good and quite reasonably priced. The beach is quite popular with surfers as there are some good sized waves (should I call them breakers?), but for us, the beach was great for little romantic walks."
MB1954,"Cape Town, South Africa",Feb 2016,"As most of the beaches in the Nusa Dua area are ""connected"" to a hotel or resort, they are kept very clean and tidy."
Savmck,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Feb 2016,What a surprise.   Lovely stunning clean beach.   Private and your not getting hassled by vendors.  One of the nicest beach I've been to outside Australia 
Misiscarter,"Toodyay, Australia",Feb 2016,"Beach is clean and sand is raked every morning great for standup boarding, swimming, surfing, snorkelling, sun bathing, path way along the beach for bike riding "
SedaEg,Istanbul,Aug 2015,"Beach is nice. However with the tide, when the sea pulls out, it turns into an extremely rocky area which isn't the nicest experience. Compared to Kuta or Seminyak on the other side of the island, Nusa Dua is quieter and much more private."
Linda B,"Cherrybrook, Australia",Feb 2016,"A pleasant beach with many 5 star private beach clubs. Not too many locals harassing you to buy their goods or massages. Nice, well priced restaurant nearby for lunch. I preferred to stay in the resort and taken advantage of my private pool"
Wanderer629587,3 contributions,Feb 2016,"Lovely beach,  very calm. The water is mostly clear. A bit of seaweed bit otherwise okay. The water was a bit too warm for my liking! "
msprenger001,"Beijing, China",Feb 2016,"Unforgettable - blue sky, flower petals forming a path, a light breeze - the perfect setting for a beach wedding - and unlike other Bali beaches completely solitary"
Aprila070,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2016,"We decided the night prior to head to the beach for a sun rise if the weather cleared.Awake at 550am, still dark. By the time we left the hotel at 6am it was a short 10 min walk to the beach from the Marriott.We sat on some lounges and watched the crowd gather - about 30 people ended up on the beach watching the red/pink sun rise over the ocean.We walked the beach without to many hassles and enjoyed stretching our legs before the heat of the day set in.The beach was lovely and clean and the walk back enjoyable."
Kat S,"Sheffield, UK",Feb 2016,Long enough for an hour stroll. At high tide deep enough for a swimm. You do not have to pay for entrance. Within walking distance of bali colection
Verina Smith,"London, UK",Feb 2016,"To enter this beach need to come to BTDC first. Some restaurant in front of the beach, kids friendly, i saw some people doing yoga aswell in the garder facing the beach. Also they have a big garden to walk and joging, so many local brought their pets for plays. Nice and you can also see the water blow. I love the spot."
Mass22,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2015,"Very nice beach, it has its flaws. Its has a lot of coral and sea weed so might put some people off. Sea shoes are recommended and be careful if venturing out on the coral during low tide. loads of tiny pools to discover and play with but i did see evil looking slug that screamed ""im poisonous"" and Sea snake jamming among some sea weed. Might i add i did not go back to explore the corals after that day. The beach is clean. We stayed at one of the hotels and the beach are cleaned by the staff."
TonyandDana I,"Wilson, NC",Feb 2016,"Awesome, quiet, beautiful beaches.  You can sit all day under an umbrella taking in the gorgeous view.  We will definitely return. "
Tanya-Maree,"Waiheke Island, New Zealand",Aug 2015,This is a wonderful place to enjoy a stroll on the beach or to participate in all the different watersports.  I would recommend getting a package as you get to try all the activities.  Well worth paying for a tour and getting them to take you there and back including the activities.
Caio B,17 contributions,Feb 2016,The walking along the beach and resorts is really nice and enjoyable.You can have a cocktail or have a lunch/dinner even if you are not staying in the resorts.There are plenty of water sports.Our favorite area in Bali.
Karan A,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,"We did Water Sports at Nusa dua beach and I guess one of the hot destination for water sports. It was a bit crowded but we had our own fun. It is big enough to give you your personal space. The water is clear. We did Parasailing, Fish Fly, Jet ski, Banana Boat, Turtle Island and Scuba dive.The beach wasn’t as clean where we did Parasailing. But it offered picturesque view when we did Banana boat and Jet ski. While doing Jet ski I realised the sea was not really as crowded as it appeared earlier. It gave a personal beach kind of feeling!Ride to Turtle island was fun! I did my first Scuba and it was worth every second there deep under water. The water was not as clear, and the instructor told us that it is more clear in morning hours and we visited in noon time. But the feeling of underwater, spotting corals, fishes, looking at the floor of the sea and swimming like sea, Lord Ganesha idol is beyond comprehension! One of the best of the times we had!"
RavinSA,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2016,"By far one of the most picturesque beaches I have ever seen. like a never-ending pool, perfect for kinds and lazy rolling about."
Greti,"Orebro, Sweden",Feb 2016,Really nice beach with clean white sand. Our hotel has a private area there so we could really enjoy our time here. Water could be cleaner (lot of algea) but local people really do their best. 
Pierre S,"Vancouver, Canada",Jan 2016,Lovely beach both in the daytime and evening because of the promenade that links the various hotels.  Lots of variety in terms of restaurants; also includes pleasant open-air shopping area that is not overly posh (and priced acordinly...).
Ursh,"Ettalong Beach, Australia",Feb 2016,"The beach was a great surprise. We stayed previously at Seminyak and the beach was not at all nice. The beach here had white sand, no rubbish and also not a lot of hawkers. A few water activities available, however our kids were happy with the pool and we also visited in rainy season so wasn't a lot of beach time weather. Our resort had a gorgeous setting on sand for drinks at sunset. Look forward to stopping here again. "
dado,"Doha, Qatar",Feb 2016,This place is amazing. We went there few mins before sunset and had dinner in a nice restaurant called aroma (already submitted review if u want to check it ) The beach was a bit crowded but that is normal as it's so nice water is warm and nice waves !! Was super romantic as you can see in the photos RECOMMENDED 
Natalija R,"Guangzhou, China",Feb 2016,"After we saw dirty beach of Seminyang (due to low tide and rainy season) this beach was a piece of cake! Clean beach with white sand, not a lot of people, amazing view, blue water. Loved it! BUT still  the water was not transparent and had sea weed in water and on beach, so i suggest come to Bali in summer, cuz during raining season (winter) water is pretty dirty everywhere, enjoy your holidays. "
Ffang3056,"South Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,Stayed at the Ritz Carlton. Beautiful hotel with extremely attentive staff and faultless service. Sadly a little isolated for my liking and far too many mosquitos. Although they fogged every day the mosquitos were not deterred.
Xavier G,"Horsham, UK",Jan 2016,"One of the best beaches in Bali and no wonder why the Island's 5 star hotels tend to be based here. The waters are calm, the beaches are clean and clear. "
jola76,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"if want to find a quiet beach, clean, not too crowded and it's free (although surrounded by luxury hotels), this is the right place. nearby are many interesting view include Arjuna statues, and water blow. to the location even this is not too difficult, and many directions there."
Jaybac,"Surat, Australia",Feb 2016,The beach was very clean & well guarded. It was indeed very safe to take a dip or swim with this ur kids.
Shakeel Yoonus,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Feb 2016,"we came here only for the water sports. we tried flyfish, doughnut, banana boat and adventure parasailing. a good fun filled day."
Genuinereviewer,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,"Clean and beautiful beach with a marvelous view of the peninsula. Very few salespeople here. Would be lovely for families, couples, surfers and the like. "
Joey L,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"We stayed in BALI six day , Nusa Dua Benoa beach is a very long beautiful and quiet clean beach , suitable to swim and sun bath .A lots of fancy resort around the beach , There is some seafood restaurant and bars . Also you will see many women who wear traditional BALI dress , they provide outdoor massage service,  Grab a cocktail , ready a good book , enjoy the day !! Recommendation : Pick a day , hire a bike from your resort cycling through the beach , explore different angle of the beach , beautiful seashore ."
devis0n,"Yeosu, South Korea",Feb 2016,"I think this beach is comparable to Sanur beaches.  Quiet surf, nice sand, view and a lot less quieter than the beaches of Seminyak and especially Kuta.  A great place for romantic lounging with a couple or to spend family time.  There are not a lot facilities around except for the odd hotel restaurant though."
KarolaRS,"7,069 contributions",Jun 2015,"Long white beaches, good restaurants, drinks equal in earshot. Here you can relax properly. Prices for the chairs  very low compared to what was otherwise offered elsewhere. "
DanyMark88,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"Pristine beach, good for water sports as the sea is very calm in this part of Bali.  Surrounded by many 4/5 star resorts. Not much else to do here if not staying in one of the big hotels."
Farrah F,"Concord, CA",Jan 2016,"Came here to watch the sunrise on our last day ""team no sleep"" the sand is soft the beach is long. There are chairs along you can sit. It's a nice beach"
Andrew C,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2015,"Twice I have been to Nusa Dua,  Both times it is filled with seaweed.  Walked along the beach during low tide once and it is even worse.  If you come to Nusa Dua, don't come for the beach."
Suranjeen,"Ranchi, India",Jan 2016,"This beach is clean and private. The water is clear, you could actually see your penny fall and dive to get it."
Evelyn V,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"We stayed at Westin Nusadua in December, which directly connected to the beach. It was quiet and clean, with security guards everywhere. Definitely a good venue to jog in the morning."
Libor79,"Prague, Czech Republic",Feb 2016,"This beach is quite nice stretch of white sand, that is relatively clean and maintained, especially if you walk around the bigger and luxurious hotels. A promenade lines the shore , passing hotels of mainly 4-5* rating, allowing you to see the gardens, pools and the architecture of each hotel. This promenade, especially heading south of hotel Bali Tropic offers nice walks, good jogs or bike rides. Heading north of the hotel, after about 1,5km, you will pass through few dirty and unkept areas, which ruins the walk. There are a few downsides of this otherwise lovely beach-Firstly it is the constant noise of water scooters and fast boats, that spoil the tranquility of this place. We visited in February '16 and the hotels and beaches were quite empty, which suited us. However I can imagine this place getting very busy and even noisier in the peak periods and turning this lovely area into sea of bodies fighting for the beach and sun lounger. The second downside is the difference in tide of these shallow waters . In high tide, the swimming areas (you can only swim in small sections marked by the buoys) is ok but never too deep, which makes is ideal for small children. Also the currents are very weak, making the beach quite safe for non swimmers. During the low tide, in many places you can barely swim- the water level is up to the waistline. Also in low tide you often swim through the algae, which is not pleasant at all. The hotels are trying to clean the beach of plastic, algae and other debris, but sometimes their efforts are not enough. In general, it is a lovely stretch of beach worth visiting and perhaps staying in one of many luxury hotels. "
helhng,"Taipei, Taiwan",Feb 2016,"We went to the beach from bebek bengil, and there were some trash and rocky sands in the water. The public beach was kid friendly without surfers. Its a beach for kids but definately not the best one. I assume the private beach of nusa dua is much better than this. "
Jayaprakash N,Bangalore,Jan 2016,"Nusa dua means 2 islands. Literal meaning is Nusa is Island and Dua mean two in Malay.Its a enclave of  large 5-star resorts / Hotels. Just found one huge Hospital in the vicinity.It caters golf resorts, fine dining and R&R. Surfing and diving are popular activities for more active visitors to this beach destination.  It has an  array of spas, galleries and boutiques await those who prefer less exertion. Local Barong performances can be admired at Batubulan"
AnniUK,21 contributions,Dec 2015,Beautiful clean beaches not like in Kuta where I found the beach very dirty Nusa Dua beach great for any age and water very clean 
Helen Z,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"Very clean, beautiful surrounding as most resorts had there own beach where you could lay back on the lounge and order  food and drinks with the staff"
anks_baaz,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2015,Clear waters for scuba and snorkeling male sure your bargain for the gearnice place to relax and click some great pictures
aquick2016,"Altrincham, UK",Jan 2016,"Uncluttered, relaxing,breathtakingly beautiful .With comfortable sun loungers and attentive staff I have yet to find a beach to better it."
LEVAN TAVADZE,"Beijing, China",Feb 2016,"It's our 6th visit to this hotel. Food and service quality the best. Only smiling faces around. Very good Italian restaurant, Japanese restaurant Hamabe and international restaurant IKAN also are very nice choice for dinner. quit big swimming pool for adults and separated small kids pool with the roof. Food quality in the hotel is much better than in Bali collection. "
YusufKS,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Nusa Dua area has always been known as one of the exclusive and elite area in Bali. Most of this beaches have been linked directly to luxury hotels that have a lot of nice facilities. But that does not mean only people who stay in luxury hotels that can enjoy the beauty of Nusa Dua. There is a path that can be passed by general people to visit and enjoy the beauty of Nusa Dua.It's very well maintained, that's why this beach is so clean and very beautiful. Here I have found one of paradises in Bali, I called the place : Blue Heaven.p.s. Check my Flickr to see the photo of Blue Heaven (in colors, not black&white), photos of Bali and many more! I wrote my Flickr link on my TripAdvisor profile, just check it out if you interested :)"
bimbo049,Philippines,Nov 2015,"nusa dua beach is best for family with childrens, i think the water is more cleaner and safer to swim than kuta beach,not busy beach unlike kuta beach you can have more privacy to swim,many high end hotels and restaurant..."
Anna C,14 contributions,Feb 2016,We had a wonderful stay - the beach outside our hotel was kept wonderfully clean and the water was lovely to swim in.
Mel D,"Great Malvern, UK",Jun 2015,Beautiful well kept place the sea was warm and a daily walk  along the beach brought you to little bars and places to eat - safe and idyllic.
RPM,"Dharamsala, India",Feb 2016,It's a nice family beach that is pebbled with eateries. The quality of food and drinks offered is not worth the money (unless you are only buying the old Bintang)
kel668,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jan 2016,Nusa beach is a more relaxed area as compared to kuta. U find yourself hidden in paradise. The waves are calm...good to explore
Adhiegunadharma,Bandung,Feb 2016,"Really enjoy swimming in Nusa Dua Beach. We feel having more privacy. Beach was cleaner than Kuta Beach, and in my opinion this beach was more save than the other beaches.Some hotel are located in beachfront, with its beach club. "
jollyjoyce,"Carlisle, UK",Dec 2015,Nice beach area. Touristy but good security at the entrances to the area.Lots of nice hotels with local restaurants close by.
najimudeen,"Melaka, Malaysia",Jan 2016,Nusa Dua beach is very shallow and clam. Can swim for a short distance. The sand is white and clean. Children enjoy making sand castle
Marianna K,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,I loved the scenery every morning while I was having breakfast though. It seemed like those resorts and hotels are not much interested in cleaning their beach sides as they all have good swiming pools?!
futsanglung,"Rotherham, UK",Jan 2016,"lots of the beach is ""owned "" by the hotels that front it and can only be used by their guests. Nice sand but shallow water with not much chance of swimming unless you go out past the coral and that can be a long way"
Norma O,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,The water is crystal clear and it was so cool to swim.  No stingers or issues.  We were lucky enough to be right on the beach at our hotel and it was quiet without harassment of any kind.
skylger,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",Jul 2015,had a great afternoon here on the beach. was nice in the wind and the sun. nicer then some other beaches with much more swell and seeweed
mike s,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2016,"I love this beach...just the road from my villas to beach need improve as for public, local authority need pay attention as the Beach so cool..."
SajUK1,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"Very clean beach, not very busy towards the more expensive hotels We stayed at the Grand Hyatt - own dedicated beach was great - no complaints at all.Traveled in Aug 2014"
Kirk P,"Ashburton, New Zealand",Jan 2016,We hired a bike and biked down the beach. Best way to get around the beach. Lots of nice hotels. People are nice and it is safe. 
Lee h,48 contributions,Jan 2016,Possibly the most quiet beach in Bali. Small waves good for swimming. Lots of locals pestering you about 'water sports'
Nitin H,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2016,It's a nice beach with crystal clear water and white sand. The beach is very safe. There are hardly any waves here. We felt like swimming in the pool. When we went it wasn't crowded. No beach sports here and hence it is quiet. Lot of restaurants in the vicinity. Overall nice beach.
sourabh c,8 contributions,Jan 2016,This place is gr8 for any one looking to explore advantages and love to walk around.You can go shopping in bali collection or move around the beach which is accessible from 3sides.
Natasha K,3 contributions,Jan 2016,Nice and private beach and the sand is clean. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton which had a private beach. It is lovely as there aren't people pushing you to ride jet skis or go parasailing.
Priyansha J,3 contributions,Jan 2016,"Clean, fresh, new, and beautiful.We did not want to come here as we'd heard it's only known for it's resorts/it's for people who are looking to relax. My second day here and I've done so much: shopping, jet skiing, even scuba diving!"
Katrina C,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2016,"Over all the beach is nice. The part where locals go is not as clean as the part where high end hotels are located. I think the problem is that the beach doesn't have enough bins. So people just leave rubbish on the beach which is terrible. Especially when you walk down the little park on peninsular it is littered with cigaret buds, plastics, etc. And again no one cleans the area and no bins around. It's actually quite scandalous to see considering it is called one of the luxury beaches in South Kuta! Also, I personally would like to suggest to the local authorities to ban smoking on the beach and provide dedicated areas for it to stop the problem of the cigaret buds scattered across the beach! And issue fines for people who leave rubbish behind! It will not only provide smoke free beach for the children but also will save the sea from the trash. Bali should do more to tackle the trash issue if they want to meet the European standards.  "
Wilbury878,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"My wife and I were there 20 years ago for our honeymoon. It was wonderful. Just went back in January 2016 and could not believe our eyes. Tourism has destroyed the place. There is no culture left, it is overcrowded and expensive and, worst of all, polluted.Go to Nusa Lembongan instead. It is what Bali was like 20 years ago."
Foxyyy,"Hughesdale, Australia",Jan 2016,"We stayed at the Grand Mirage Nusa Dua 20 years ago, and now the area is overdeveloped and, well, ugly! There is no 'jungle' left, just mile after mile of hotels and restaurants. The watersports operators are greedy and opportunistic and it has lost its relaxing feel. A complete let down, especially the snorkeling.I highly recommend going to Lembongan Island by the public express boat and heading to Captain Bobo's Warung. You can snorkel cheaply and the water is crystal clear and the wildlife abundant. Don't waste your money on the Nusa Dua snorkeling trips, unless you like murky, rough water and being attacked by floating plastic bags."
AElena83,"Lecco, Italy",Jul 2015,very nice beach. not too crowed. the water is really clean. I enjoyed th tide. allow you to walk  a lot into the sea.
Konstantin S,25 contributions,Jan 2016,"Just an average beach, nothing special. Not too clean. Would recommend other beaches like Pantai Pandawa, that is only 10 minutes away and is more attractive. If you are looking for something more remote, with less crowd, then Green Bowl would be more suitable, it's only 15 minutes away from Nusa Dua."
Norine007,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"relaxing beach, full of comfy chairs and gazebos. we visited this beach at the nusa dua resort complex.clean, beautiful with lots of eateries and bars to choose from"
SelinaCheang,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2016,"It was a bit disappointed with the beach. We expected the beach will be a bit more well-maintain since it is some kind like private beach that belongs to the Nusa Dua community but we found out that it has no different with other public beach. We found all sort of rubbish along the bay, food residues, coconut shells, food containers, plastic bags, etc, we don't even dare to go down the water to swim. The only thing that we felt amaze with is a place called ""Water Blow"" , you can see waves colliding onto the rock wall creates a giant splash like the water is ""blowing up"", it was quite an amazing view. Water Blow is located near to Grand Hyatt Hotel. "
Des S,"Grafton, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2016,"Used the beach over a 10 day stay at Ayodya. It is protected by an outside reef, had waves some days but mostly flat and very clear water, no rubbish. beautiful white sand."
funblu16,"New York City, NY",Jan 2016,"This review is for the portion of the beach in front of The Laguna hotel.  The water has a lot of garbage in it b/c of all the boats that come in and out for the various watersport activities.  During low tide, the beach literally turns into swamp land so you can walk out pretty far into the ocean (but beware of sea urchins, wear sandals)!  Was also annoyed by the vendors that constantly walked the beach trying to sell sarongs, hats and tattoos to you - I just wanted to relax on the beach, but constantly had to shoo them away.  Overall,  disappointed with this beach experience, the beaches in the Caribbean (i.e., Bahamas, Virgin Islands, etc.) are MUCH nicer."
Sarvs F,Te Atatu,Jan 2016,A beautifully staged and clean beach for tourists that want to be pampered. Loved the fact that where we settled along the beach the bar served Bintang (not the case at Potato Head 🙊). You must purchase to sit at the table or if you arrive early rent the shaded sunbeds. For next to nothing have one of the mamas give you a massage. Beautiful as it is it's quite isolated from the real Bali though.
ZanthAgo,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"my kids love to swim there , clean. nice and relaxing day with beautiful surrounding. good to go there again one day"
shelley M,"Bonnells Bay, Australia",Jan 2016,"So disappointing to see such beautiful beaches with rubbish spoiling the oceans. Beach is so clear and sands are white, picture perfect really until you swim into rubbish and this spoils the experience. I can't understand why there is no one cleaning this up considering all the five star accommodation along this coastline. Maybe some of that money that is being made at these hotels should go back into conservation. "
justscottish04,"Moruya, Australia",Jan 2016,"We loved the beach not far walking distance from the Bali collection there was two little island that you can walk out to and have a look at the cliff edge. We also seen the big iconic statue and the water blow. The day we went the waves weren't wild so didn't get the full experience of the waves sweeping over the rocks and the viewing point. Beautiful scenery!! It was great to go site seeing then we stopped into a hotel and had a beer. The perks of this is you can use their pool to cool down. We at the Pirates bay, you should check that out great experience :).The beach was so clean and water is clear."
marilyntozer,"Devon, UK",Jan 2016,"Walk this stretch most days then stop for a beer. Mostly hotels with outlets in between, nice little shopping outlet at far end."
SusanHsk,"Hillarys, Australia",Oct 2015,Beach is clean and white sand. Didn't see many people swimming though but in Nusa Dua the pools are just as close.
Fearless448788,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"One of the nicest beaches in Bali and we have visited a few. Great beach clubs where you can relax, drink and swim in luxury. "
Nasra_hm,"London, UK",Aug 2015,Beautiful white sand beach with many restaurants to dine at facing the beach. There's so many water activities to take part in. 
Alskis70,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2016,"Beautiful,  peaceful beach with lovely clean sand. Highly recommend. Waves are a good size for people of all ages."
Sunchaser,"Victoria, Australia",Jan 2016,"A little disappointed in all the beaches in Bali. We sure are spoiled in Australia with our beaches. This was nice. Sand a bit scratchy and stoney. Lots of nice pool loungers to sit and relax on. Water very warm, quite clear a bit of rubbish floating about - not bad "
Adridi_yanto,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"No need to spend a lot of money to see this beach. just pay the parking fee, then you can see the beautiful Nusa Dua Beach....enjoy it."

AlejandroMartinez,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"Nusa dua beaches are beautiful, great landscape, beautiful view to the volcano, marine sports, and great people, the only thing It needs is better policies and fines around rubbish, as tourist is our responsibility as well to keep the beaches clean, it is our planet at the end of the day, let's keep it tidy and beautiful "
Adie K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,The Novotel Private beach was clean and well serviced.Only the best times to go is from 8:00am to midday and 3:30pm to 6:00pm as these times the heat isn't at its greatest. Prices are average for that area for both food and drink.
LesleynD,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"Nice, clean and white sand beach. Even after NY fireworks, the beach was swept and clean. Very pleasant compared to the beaches in Legian or Seminyak."
Andy22L,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2016,"Nusa Dua is a public beach; as such, you can expect there to be crowds, beach vendors and litter strewn about. It also felt rather pretentious with the slew of luxury resorts monopolising the area."
skyhoosier,"Naples, FL",Oct 2015,"This is a lovely beach away from the hustle and bustle outside Nusa Dua.  Several resorts in the area, but still remarkably uncrowded."
elliechua,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2015,"Clear waters and soft sand. The beach was quite empty when i was there, making it the perfect place to chill and read a book. "
Manuel S,"Lisbon, Portugal",Dec 2015,"The perfect place for being in beach. White and clean sans and the sea cal, with some good (and safe) waves also."
lovadlina,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"White sand, calm waves, blue sea.. Nusa Dua is a beach where you can relax and enjoy tranquility with your loved ones. There are also some cafes and attractions. The beach itself is free to entry, but there's some private area belongs to nearby resort."
Nalovi,Buenos Aires,Dec 2015,Beautiful crystal warm water... you have both the flat water like a swimming pool or the surf if you go a bit offshore... couldn't be better combination. It is surrounded by resorts life though.
HelloMrBerry,Brisbane ,Jan 2016,"This is a great place to go to if you don't want to be disturbed. We were sad to see rubbish in the sea, though, but not too much in front of the hotels. There was coral also floating in the sea so watch out you don't cut yourself! The Grand Nikko was a good place to stay, also. "
Odilia19,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Better to visit here since it quiet than Kuta. White sand beach and clean water also so many cafes and restaurant with romantic music along the beach
flowiet,45 contributions,Jan 2016,"if you're looking for some peace and quiet, this is the beach for you.  Its very different compared to Kuta or Legian because its more private.  Private luxurious hotels are built along the beach, so its very private.  "
Kaz5001,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2015,"Perfect for a couples holiday to just relax, enjoy local food and entertainment and feel secure in a beautiful location.Water park is a great way to pass the time and happy friendly staff always welcoming.Gorgeous ocean views with peace and tranquility.There are more and more restaurants and beach clubs opening up all the time and the standard and quality is getting better and better as competition grows."
Tanya D,23 contributions,Dec 2015,This beach is beautiful if you don't go in the water.  The beach itself was lined with seaweed.  You had to dredged your way through the seaweed to find sand to stand on.  The water was kind of murky.
Per,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2015,The Nusa Dua beach is hardly swimmable in October and November due to trade winds hitting the island from the east to the west. There will be way to much seaweed (and all kinds of rubbish - plastic and bottles mainly) in the shallow water. The staff of the luxury hotels try their best to keep the seaweed off the beach but can't really keep up. It seems to be a constant battle...Also keep in mind that low tide in any case means no swimming. All in all - Bali just don't have those postcard like pictures of tropical beaches with crystal clear water. If you are seeking that Gili Islands might be a better option.
The_Roaming_Soul,"New Delhi, India",Oct 2015,"after been on the more happening beaches at kuta / legian, if you like to see white sand and blue water, this is the place to be. Its quieter, more classy."
Sonny K,25 contributions,Feb 2015,beautiful scenery for family to relax. Suitable for all age groups as the place offers activities for all
arielchang921,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,It is the best part of beach in bali compared to kuta and it is more peaceful and you can stay under the tree and feel the wind. choose a hotel nearby and enjoy it.
Gavin R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Jan 2016,With a seemingly never ending line of hotels along Nusa Dua Beach Front there will be a hotel to cater for levels of travellers. From All-inclusive to luxury 5 star resorts the choice is vast. The beachs are very clean and well maintained with high security levels. There seem to be security personal everywhere if you look but not in your face or intrusive at all. 
Lida A,Ukraine,Jan 2016,"Good view to the sea)))At 6 am people clean beachIf you want drink or eat you can do it everywhere)))You can order scooter, a bike. And morning run better at 07:00."
SienLi,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Love Nusa Dua Beach so much.Quiet, Clean, Beautiful Beach. My son like there so much.Choose hotel with the private nusa dua beach."
Rodabeh,Mumbai,Nov 2015,"Less crowded, quiet, clean, nice promenade to walk or cycle as well as places to eat. Most of the hotels in this area have direct beach access hence you can come to the beach from the hotel itself. "
addy_hols,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"If you are looking for a good swim or surf, then this beach is totally avoidable. The bay is full of weeds and no waves whatsoever. However, the esplanade walk along the coast is quite beautiful with hotels lined up on one side and the coastline on the other. "
Miapod12,"Cranbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Love swimming at nusa dua beach... Until I feel the seaweed. Sometimes of year is dirtier than others. Only a few wrappers here and there, not a rubbish dump like other beaches in Bali.Best to swim high tide. During low tide you can only get just past your knees before all the seaweed. The hotels also recommend wearing shoes into the water when swimming as there are sea urchins in the beach.No waves. No hawkers. A very calm beach. Clear water and white sand. "
Haryo_WH,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"I always love this clean private beach, therefore I always stay at Novotel Nusa Dua if I want a clean private beach, compared to other beaches."
TerryV310164,"Chelmsford, UK",Jan 2016,"Nice beach kept very clean by staff from early morning to late .we do have a bar which to be honest is not that good , trying to sell us defrosted ice cream and when they say fresh squeezed juice rubbish they do not even have a juicer just a blender and add that cheap nasty syrup and sugar err then even when I asked for a milk shake made with vanilla ice cream and me watching yes you guessed no ice cream when pointed out this was told ice cream powder more rubbish being feed to me , if you need a drink go next door to Kiki beach better "
cterrantroy,"Chatswood, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is clean, and beautiful to swim in. Also their are heaps of water activities if you desire. And the walkway paths along the shoreline are great for walking or cycling. If you want to chill out on a beach near to the airport this is it. "
metahanindita,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"My daughter really loves this place. She likes to play with sand. The beach itself is very clean, and a nice place to hang out or relax"
John D,3 contributions,Dec 2015,it's a great get away from kuta beach. chill and relaxing. the beach walk is great. the surf is not that good here compared to other parts of bali.
Agman N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"Overall a great beach with many entertainment spot all around, to get maximum experience of the beach, check in to one of the hotel which has private beach. If you just visiting to the area, chill out in The Bay, beach club with many facilities for all ages. You wont realize how time would fly so fast in the area"
L2yap,"Manila, Philippines",Dec 2015,The Good1. A bit more private beach. Few people2. Soft sands3. Strong current so be careful. But fun to play withThe Bad1. Part near water blow is dirty lots of seaweeds. Nobody is cleaning up2. No sunset
Chris-Bj-brisbane,27 contributions,Dec 2015,Lovely beach for Families as its protected from a small out of water reef not far off shore with some surf behind that that the boats can take you out if your keen for a surf. Most of the hotels have netted off the beaches so feels extra safe for tourists. Water is clean and the best bit is they dont allow hundreds of people trying to sell you things. There are only a small number of registered sellers but will not bother you. 
Sim,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,The beach is very nice except that most of the part of the beach has been taken up by private hotels and basically you cannot sit anywhere near their properties... the waves are good for surfing !
Dika Bali tours,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is good for swimming and also good for bigginer surfing .there are so many Restaurants are server western Food and autentic Balinese cousine 
Marc_and_Kim_Z,"Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany",Dec 2015,Our hotel had a private section on the east side below the park. Lots of surfers.  Lots to offer from hotels and private vendors.  The vendors on the beach did not hassle us at all.  As soon as we said no thanks they were on their way. 
Missf_85,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,Lovely place for water sports and relaxation. Be sure to bargain with sport vendors. The corn is amazing!

Ole,"Stavanger, Norway",Dec 2015,Surf lessons if you want and sunbeds for hotel guests with enoying sellers asking you every minute to buy something only thing missing was the little boy selling gum😕
Balesh J,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,"This beach is one of the cleanest in Bali. Compared to Kuta which was so crowded with Sood many vendors,this is very peaceful and nice place for a drink or dinner . We were at the Laguna so I think only the residents of the resorts are allowed. "
Irene,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,The water is very clear. The sand is smooth. My children loves to swim just near the shore. Many children playing at that beach. The beach i went to belonged to Novotel Nusa Dua. So it is a private beach. You can order drinks and snacks at the bar too.
Lik-gino,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2015,It is nice bay and you may able to work out and you can see a nice view for Sunrise and  great spot for jogging venue.
GlennDias,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Don't miss visiting the beach if you are staying in Nusa Dua. It is clean and safe, has golden yellow sand, the ocean is shallow with no undercurrents, and there are plenty of small waves for surfing activity further out. There is some seaweed floating in the shallower waters.This is classified as a private beach so you don't have noisy watercraft, loud music, etc. The beach sellers don't hard sell."
Purbaningrum_Sasmita,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,you will never find a beach with best view and nice sand in Bali. tranquil and serene that you find in Nusadua which far away from busy and crowded people. recommended to people that will stay for relax and enjoy the view.
AndiYou,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"The beach, the food, the atmosphere....GREAT! The evening view is beautiful. My entire family enjoyed the view!"
Barry L,"London, UK",Feb 2015,"Very few waves, so dont worry about a surfboard here! The sand is raked clean each morning and the water is some of the cleanest I have seen in Bali."

Sharon B,"Sanur, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"Nusa Dua is surrounded by upmarket resorts that have swimming pools.  The beaches are great to walk along send are very clean.  If you are going swimming be careful of the strong currents that can be dangerous for the inexperienced swimmer.  Otherwise, a very pleasant location"

989Richard,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,"Visited with family a bout one year ago. Spent two nights there at Nusa Dua. If you like crowded area and massage, this is not the place for you."
ferrob2013,39 contributions,Jan 2015,"Love this place. Easy to access, many hotels nearby, foods are around. This is an interesting place for tourist because it convey many practicality to enjoy your holiday.  "
BoobooChann,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,Came here on 2 Dec 2015 while looking for Water Blow. The sand along this large beach area is white and clean. Calm waters make it nice and cosy to relax. Locals love coming here for the weekend picnic. Very suitable for families and even couples. Quiet and calm environment is what makes it peaceful here.Recommended for honeymoon-goers.Waterblow is about 20-mins walk or 2-min by motorbike.Getting here is about 20mins by motorbike from Kuta/Legian Area.
Mahmoud Mumin,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",Sep 2015,"Started to walk early morning on the beach. It's an amazing experience. Love the place, perfect for honeymooners."
RiccoSpore,Singapore,Dec 2015,"Near Melia Bali hotel the beach and sea is great, clean, well maintained and you can enter the sea easily with shallow waters."
Mil1512,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"We hopped on our moped and took a drive down to Nusa Dua beach - the one located by all of the fancy hotels. We got stopped on the way in by some security guards asking where we were going, we said the beach, they asked the public beach, we said yes, they waved us through no issues. We carried on driving straight, even though there weren't many signs on the complex, but we fortunately came across the public beach. There were loads of mopeds and space to park but if you're in a car it'll be a lot more difficult to find a spot. There were a few restaurants and toilets there and you'd easily be able to walk down to the hotel owned parts of the beach if you wanted to. There were lots of locals there which was great as that's always a good indicator you're in a decent spot. We took a picnic as we weren't sure if there'd be places to eat, but next time I think we'll try one of the restaurants out. The water was gorgeous and clear and the beach really wasn't that crowded. We'll definitely be going again."
poloyul,"Golden Bay, New Zealand",Dec 2015,"Well kept beaches. The only pleasant area in Bali. No vendors, no rubbish as in Kuta. Kuta was littered as a dumpster. Nusa Dua is very well taken care of. "
Shobhit B,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,the beach was largely empty with very few people and food places around. instead there is a beach right outside Sofitel nusa dua which is pretty impressive. and you could chill at the Nikki's club on the beach !
Samosababa,"San Francisco, CA",Dec 2015,At the southern end of Bali Not much seems to be happening at the beach in Nusa Dua other than at the hotels like St Regis. Kuta is where all the action is and Jimbaran has the best sunsets and seafood Restaraunts.  I did not go to Padang Padang but was told that it was prettier  
Fon,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2015,The beach is clean and it has white sand and amazing blue water. A great place to relax and listen to the wave 
John B,"Bangkok, Thailand",Dec 2015,"It is a clean, expansive beach with clean sand and clear water.  There are chairs to rent different places, restaurants, and shops, so a nice place to spend time (aside from the private sections, which would be nice if you were a guest at the related hotel).  It's just not a great place to see coral or fish, so if you are used to the beach in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii it will seem odd there is just grass and very few fish to see, never mind octopus, eels, sea turtles, etc.  Different local people say different things about where a good place to snorkel may be but although it's a nice beach this really isn't it.  The ""very good"" rating here relates to it being so clean and broad, not about what one might see underwater, which is sand and grass, and a small fish here and there."
FleecySqueezyFizzy,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"I remembered, waking up early morning just to catch the sunrise, and we both waiting anxiously by the balcony, and admiring the beauty, simply romantic. The beach is clean, less people. Loving it."
Kuro,Italy,Jul 2015,"The beach was clean and water was good, except for the floating branches and grass on the beach."
TravelnShutterbug,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2015,"The beach is very beautiful a is owned by every property which is lined up one after the other. The beach during low tide looks sad but during the high tide it very beautiful with the reef about 100 meters ahead. We saw people kayaking out there, we did scuba diving just outside the reef and the experience was just awesome. The water was crystal clear with view upto 50 feet and the fishes swam all across and the coral was so beautiful. There are lot of guys who offer the scuba diving and other water sports options. Negotiate with them. We got scuba for 2 people for USD 100. Not bad when they asked us USD100 per person. The walk from one end to the other end on the beach was good and the hotels maintain the beach which breaches their part of the property. "
Andrew R,"Redcliffe, Australia",Dec 2015,A great retreat after the hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta.Less traders to contend with on the beach (very minimal).
Sukiz22,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2015,"Great view. Less people.Great hotel, has Bali collection , very easy to go.Totally recommended this one.Fully recommended."
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Dec 2015,Nusa Dua south if the craziness of Kuta and Legian  and offers that little haven. Clean beaches with crystal water great surf outstanding accommodation and security. 
Shawn B,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2015,"From kuta, you can catch an uber to nusa dua for about 80k. It's an amazing beach on the south eastern side of Bali. There are plenty of hotels and eateries nearby if you want to stay longer. The beach is very pristine, clean and beautiful, and makes for a good day trip. If your jamming in sites, uluwatu is about half hour drive away."
claireliu2014,"Hong Kong, China",Nov 2015,"It is a nice beach and very close to our hotel, as it is on the east, it is better to go there for the sun rise. "
flappingfootsteps,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"so we arrived at this beach using the scooty that we hired for the day. 30min ride from the main Kuta market. The water here is very clean and crystal clear. Though its a total chaos once you reach the place. Lots of watersports operators around and everyone will try to gain customers. The most important thing to remember here is Haggle!! as much as you can. Thats how it works there. Apart from watersports, one cannot enjoy a  personal time here unlike any other beaches in Bali. Do try Flying Fish and Sea bed walking, thats a must and Para Sailing is good as well as it gives a glimpse of blue green water."
Tanya R,"Depok, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"The view is fenomenal, we love it, it is clean and beautiful. we took a bicycle to look around..You should try to rent the bicycle from your hotel, and try to see different backyard from other hotels."
chris S,"Anaheim, CA",Nov 2015,"Great beach, very quiet, clear water, clean and nice weather. The water feels refreshing, good temperature, warmer than Hawaii, yet still refreshing. "
vallju,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"Nice swimming beach, white sand & has many 4 & 5 star hotels & resturants along the beachside walk-cycleways.Can find beach chairs & umbrellas for hire in front beach Bali Collection end."
joliefolie,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2015,"Nusa Dua beach was beautiful in its own right. The sand at the shore felt like quicksand, sucking you in to the top of your ankles as you walk along the beach. The water is beautiful and there is a nice boardwalk there as well as highly rated hotel, most notably the Melia with its grand female statues. The sand was full of tiny shells and rocks so be careful not to cut your feet."
A2535ATjohnw,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"A nice beach to visit, but if you have transport there are many others in Balii to see, Most hotels at Nusa Dua have their own beach spot, prices are expensive in this part of Bali."
RoshanWick,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Oct 2015,"This area is good for water sports like Jet ski, Seawalker Parasailing, Snorkeling, there are good places in end of the island in Nusa Dua"
Batchy94,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2015,"I stopped here this morning just for a quick look as I am staying in Nusa Dua for a week  in the next few days, so I thought I would come for a look, the beach here is just breathtaking, crystal clear water, nice sand, and rubbish free !!  Very happy with the state of the beach and can't wait to return on the 9th of December :)"
Stend N,"Los Angeles, California, United States",Dec 2015,"We did not stay at this hotel but tried a few things at different hotels along the beach stretch including massages , dining , bars and buffets. We were in Bali for a total of 10 days . We tried 6 spas and at the Nusa Dua spa we hands down received the worst massage experience ever . The lighting was horrible , relaxing music too loud , room was not clean , the two ladies that gave my husband and I massages clearly rushed through the process and didn't care . The lady who did mine got to my head and all she did was scratch !!!!! The oils smelt horrible we had to shower and send our clothes to laundry once we got back to our hotel . We paid for an hour each and totally regretted the experience and wished we had just gone back to Sofitel and paid double the cost like we had done the previous day but get good service !!On the brighter side , their tamarind restaurant by the beach is really good .Management , hopefully you look into this and make some changes to improve the experience of your guests !!"
Chris K,"Beirut, Lebanon",Dec 2015,"great location, clear beach, good for a swim and for relaxation.Great escape and very peaceful.Loved it"
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"The beach is pretty great (sand is like cous cous), for families with an outer reef protecting the beach. The board walk along the beach connects visitors to all the water sport activities, hotels and food outlets, along with other attractions like the ""Water Blow"" and Bias Tuget Temple."
Alex A,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,The second time we have stayed at Nusa Dua Beach. We went solely to rest and relax and did so successfully. Lovely clean sandy beach of about 1 km with a wonderful walk along the beachside path under shade and through the resorts. An easy trip to the airport.
Tariq E,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",Nov 2015,"Everyone loves nusa dua for the watersports they host, word of advice try to haggle with the people offering you the water sports as they often go for a discount if you ask, I got 25% of my batch of activities. Sea walker is a must try and have a camera in handy so you can take some shots!"
Tiziana P,"Palermo, Italy",Dec 2015,"Beautiful and amazing placeIt worth a walk along the path trhought the water front resorts, all next to each other.Nice architectures, beautiful spa spots emerging from nature,  charming musicians, peaceful atmosphere. "
Christine,Singapore,Nov 2015,"Clear waters, clean & soft sandy beach - almost perfect. Very private & quiet although there was a local selling beautiful, overpriced sarongs on the beach. Ideal for young children due to low waves (almost none) compared to seminyak or kuta beach. "
guptadrravi,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2015,"Once of the better beaches of Bali.. a true green water, quite a lengthy one.. very safe to take a dip as well.. the croud seems excellent and offen people enjoy there time privately by going to far places.. the sand is golden and beach services like body massage and spa is available easily.. but there is no food outlet so go stuffed :)"
Charmaine M,"Goa, India",Nov 2015,Worth a visit in if in the Nusa Dua area. Might take a while sometimes for the actual blow depending on the tide. But once it happens it's mind blowing. If you're feeling adventurous & willing to risk getting cut & bruised walk over the rocks and you will get totally blown away!!
Al2go,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,Don't bother visiting Nusa Dua or Bali I don't want to spend my time in a Western Hotel isolated from reality and there is too much developments going on.  The beach when we were there was filthy. Covered in rubbish and raw sewage with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem. I know that we as tourists have a responsibility to do what we can and I hope that most of us do .Having a beer and a feed on the beach is good but again you get hassled . The extra arrival tax that  Australians Pay does not help I feel if they don't like us why come to this Country. We will be looking at other destinations where we are welcome. I do feel sorry for the descent Balinese we have meet over the years but it has changed
aki_freak,"Wellington, New Zealand",Nov 2015,The beach is really clean and with less people to spoil the fun. Its a must visit when in nusa Dua. Although there are not quite a lot of shops around which for me was a turn off. 
Tempotraveller,Bangalore,Nov 2015,The Nusa Dua Beach is very clam and soothing. Not many people around so one has all the time and space to oneself. Ideal time to go to the beach is around 4 pm.
Tristan HM,"Nerja, Spain",Nov 2015,"Came to this beach on several ocassions, great to get some tan, all amenities are there.The beach is not bad the front 100m is low tide with a good selection of smaller sized fish, however once you pass the 100m the waves come into play, after the wave break there is many large fish, sharks, and its mainly rockDownpart, crazy current and if its a wavy day dont try to get into the waves (unless u surf)"
candywho,83 contributions,Aug 2015,We did get a chance to visit the Waterblow attraction by the Nusa Dua Beach. The visit was short since the water wasn't blowing on the waiting area as it was low tide during the morning. But we did get to have a great glimpse of water hitting the rocks and it was just lovely and at the same time scary. Must see just make sure that you get to visit when the water blows onto the rocks for a great photo!
Kerry D,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"This beach is beautiful, very clean, you don't get hassled by sellers every 5 minutes, lots of water sports if you want, call into any of the restaurants along the beach for a meal or a drink, an enjoyable walk along the boardwalk (this is up around the Westin resort)"
B787skipper,"Doha, Qatar",Oct 2015,Like all the beaches in the area this one is no different.. great beach on a aqua blue sea.. gotta love this place.
ridha w,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2015,Many times I went to Nusa Dua Beach. Quite and not many people in here. Beach is very clean and not too deep so it is save for kids.
carpediem176,SF,Nov 2015,"Nice calm waters, but not the clearest. Sand was a bit rocky. We've seen better in Hawaii and Zanzibar. Not too many water activities either. Wouldn't recommend flying here from the states for the beach "
Traveg,"Vadodara, India",Nov 2015,"The beach is having white sand and good shape.. Having all the big resorts on it ,makes this beach perimium..@ 10 km from intl airport..its very upmarket beach.... There is big mall Bali Collection at this beach... Worth exploring while you r at Bali"
Carine P,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,"Bali has so many beaches, this one isn't the prettiest to be honest, but if you are around kuta, or legian, this is a good alternative to run from the crowd. its a nice place just to sit, relax and enjoy a balinese day :)"
heuer101,Zaandam,Nov 2015,Nice and relatively quiet beach with little to no noisy watersports activities. Really a beach to chill & relax
David-Traveller15,"Kuching, Malaysia",Sep 2015,Nusa Dua beach was a clean and relaxing beach at Bali.  There are plenty of Resorts and Hotels along the beach. Their government emphasise in Tourism Industry and they give support to maintain the beach in good condition. Nice for family activities and all the accommodation nearby were Value for Money if you stay at any of it.
Georgie Thomas B,"London, UK",Nov 2015,"We crossed over the bridge toll road on the Denpasar airport road, the charge was 11k for the taxi. As soon as you hit the beach road there is an utter abundance of water related activities that can be hired relatively easily and cheaply from the ubiquitous bananas being dragged by speed boat to the inflatable rafts again being pulled by speed boat, jet ski and parascending, all at reasonable rates.There is no end of different foods available from high end in the hotels down to the B.F.C, yes you guessed it the equivalent of K.F.C but leg for leg, pardon the pound take the B.F.C, the kids loved it. So to reiterate a very nice cheap day out for the family at the beach, you will need your local taxi driver to take you over the bridge, it is defiantly worth while keeping him for the day as he knows all the local vendors and can trade you many activities, budget around 500k to keep him for the day, well that's starting out from our base in Ubud. Enjoy .."
Antipasti79,"Munich, Germany",Nov 2015,"The beach is beautiful, but you have to consider the tides. Water is gone in the morning and as well in evening where. Best time is between 10 AM and 4PM"
Mel C,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"Beautiful beach. Very clean and safe. We are happy to swim, boat or jetski. Lots of fun activities to participate in. "
Remy N,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015," The beach gets better towards Pantai Genger, so keep walking if you started of in the middle of Nusa Dua beach."
Mohsin_AHM,Dhaka,Dec 2014,I visited this place for 4 times in last 3/4 years. Its very clean. It has access from almost all 5 star hotel and resorts. Beach game and sea sports also available.
STEPHEN W,"Rochester, UK",Nov 2015,There is plenty to do here with water activities and sports galore to do from parasailing to jet skiing to getting a glass bottom boat to Turtle Island and a walk along the beach for us older generation.
Ch3rtan,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2015,"Stay at Westin Nusa Dua...lovely hotel, so clean and the room is big. We had a business meeting and Inge was a great events manager."
rushitj,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2015,"This is a quiet beach, it's occupied by a stretch of luxury resorts with a few areas open to public. The water is quite calm, if you're looking for waves this beach isn't for you."
Ankit D,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",Dec 2014,"Lots of water sport actitvities going on, met few locals who were extremely friendly. Just sit by one of the numerous shacks /  restaurants on the beach and have a lazy lunch and a drink. Beach is shallow and you can go to a far distance even if you are not a swimmer."
Pauline N,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"loved a romantic walk along the beach at night, quiet with lights along pathway and highlight waves, and so clean. Grab a gelati and enjoy. Watch out for little crabs though."
Ty Wightman,"Phoenix, AZ",Nov 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is in the gated resort complex, so there are no hawkers, and very few locals. This is a great place to watch the sunrise, and at that time you will also see a few locals catching crabs and gathering seaweed during low tide. There are not really any waves, so do not expect to do any surfing, and I believe most of the beach is private, so unless you are staying at one of the nearby resorts, you may not be able to use the beach. There are many restaurants at the many resorts that line the beach, but they are pricey."
Globetrotter_411,Montreal,Mar 2015,"We were there in march 2005. The water was too cold to swim but we did enjoy nice walks on the beach.You can walk for hours and rest in the bures when in need of shades. Lots of vendors and massages beds, yet prettier and more quiet than Jimbaran or Kuta."
Arthur H,"Mandurah, Australia",Oct 2015,Lovely beach. Mainly used by hotel guests . Great place to.  Relax as there no hawkers and people trying to sell you things. Great eating places in all the many hotels along the beach. Good shopping centre also. Food or accomadation not cheap.
Bostjan355,"Aberdeen, UK",Nov 2015,When the tide is in is blissfully calm fro swimming But suffers from high tides and on low tide THERE IS NO WATER for half a day at a time.... 
jajavalB,"Lampang, Thailand",Nov 2015,"White sand beaches locate among luxury chains of hotels and resorts, quite private and not touristy or overcrowded with tourists, like Kuta beach.this area is resrved for high-end tourists. All facilities are available to indulge your pleasant stay without going to the bustling city , Denpasar . stay here gor peace and calmness. "
lostdipika,Wisconsin,Aug 2015,"This is one outstanding beach, we stayed at the Novotel and the beach was walking , most of the hotels here have a private patch of beach. The sun rises are stunning and the sunsets are super surprising, the sand looks pink and romantic. Perfect place to sua bath and read a book. The hawkers are not allowed, so it is way more peaceful and relaxing"
costin r,"Berlin, Germany",Oct 2015,"We did not stop here, but we walked along it. Seems great, fine sand, crystal clear water. Quite close to Bali Collection and Water Blow. "
Menno0o,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"The beach of Nusa Dua is just perfect; there is know dirt and almost no sellers. If you don't like to walk down the stairs to come to the best beaches of bali, the is Nusa Dua the best solution"
Gary K,"Toowoomba, Australia",Aug 2015,From Seminyak we hired a car and driver for the day to take us to Nusa Dua Beach for some land based snorkelling. Not the best snorkelling available but certainly affordable and great for some relative newbys to snorkelling. The beach itself consists of white sand and was relatively empty so hiring a boat and guide to take us to a reef was easy and inexpensive for a group of five. 
081well2015,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is nice and good for swiming, waves is not big. very good for family and friends. don't forget bring camera of mobile phone to take some pictures.Recommended"
Dayna S,"Phoenix, AZ",Oct 2015,"I have been to many beaches, from Hawaii to many islands in the Caribbean.  The sand is clean and white.  Found it to be a little more corse than I like.  Several water sports available.  My husband renter a paddle board for a great price.  I like the best that there not big wave crashing. I hate fight in big wave, having a hard time coming out of the ocean and having a bathsuit filled with and.  This beach you don't have that problem."
MJ L,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Go for it, chill, swim, dice, snorkel, kids, sun batch, read a good, jog, run, pull up a chair or stool at a beach side bar. Play beach volleyball kick a ball, watch others do that. Enjoy "
retiredtravelagent,"Vancouver, Canada",Jan 2015,Quite surprised as to how average this long flat windy beach was. No feel of paradise .  a flat beach.
Gillilena,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Oct 2015,"Beautiful, uncrowded, safe and clean beach. Great for kids, loads of little play areas, beach volleyball etc.. "
Ssbcaoba,"Prague, Czech Republic",Oct 2015,I spent three days at Nusa Dua Beach! The sand was pearly white and soft and the water warm and translucent. It was calm and just simply a beautiful place
scottbill9,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2015,This is a lovely long beach and perfect for a swim or walk. The nearby temple and blowhole is well worth visiting.
Alexandra,"Los Angeles, CA",Dec 2014,"There are much nicer places in Bali than Nusa Dua in general. If you want a commercial, touristy, with bad food and below average restaurants, then this is for you. The beach is wide and sandy but the tides make it almost un-swimmable, it's too shallow. There are also millions of people."
vicnot,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Can be rocky at low tide. Good for learning to surf.Didn't see any open drains.Peddlars were not pushy.
Jake M,"Caloundra, Australia",Nov 2015,"Great little piece of beach here! Beautiful, quiet, serene and the perfect place to have a few cold ones, nice swim and relax a while! "
timhartland,"Mandurah, Australia",Nov 2015,"Compared to other parts like Kuta this is amazing- really white sand, outer reef and clear water - Bali at best."
Sergey1317,"Moscow, Russia",Oct 2015,"Very good sand, clear water. You just have to follow the information about hihh and low water to be able to swim."
Sandra E,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"Gorgeous beach. Not hassled too much by sellers. Great for swimming, very clean, good for all ages . You can walk a long way out before it gets really deep and has clear water to see to the bottom"
lahlahC77,16 contributions,Oct 2015,Sooo many top notch hotels and resorts and water sports to boot.Great place full of fun. The water is crystal clear and super clean the weather was perfect.Well worth the travel time to get there from staying in Seminyak.
Fabian A,18 contributions,Oct 2015,"This is a nice beach, there are great parts with white sandy beach but the seaweed is a concern.  this is a great place for snorkling and to do some watersports"
Paddy N,Mumbai,Oct 2015,"Wonderful water and sand-the ideal place to hang out with a beer.A world famous ""Buddhist oil massage"" awaits the interested traveller-much sought after but expensive(Rp 150-250000) for a beach massage.It appears that much of the beach front has been taken over by very large premium hotels and resorts,for the purposes of water sports.There is a very small strip available to the public.Due to the ne for transportation,noit many beachwalkers and casual tourists"
Darmawan I,17 contributions,Oct 2015,This beaches are verry well known in others country. Because the beach are very clean.white sandy along nusa dua peninsula. And there are a lots off watersport activities. Such as.snorkling.diving. parasailingWind surfing. Jetsky.banana boat.glass bottom boat . Fishing. Turtle island.and many more.you will enjoy the beautiful sunrice. Also you can see the sunset as well.over view by benoa Harbour. And the beaches are verry fine white sandy.when you lying down to the beach you will feel like in paradise like no other else in the world you will find. Good luck guys
Denis P,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2015,Really nice and clean place. Not too deep so you can swim with children there. However it is hard to get there if you are not guest in any of the Nusa Dua hotels. 
Awf Abdulrahman,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Really you have to go and see the sunset on the nusa Dua beach where restaurants are available. So you can order the grilled seafood and enjoy eating just on the beach specially for the dinar at the time of sunset. 
Handoko T,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"It is great for either runner or jogger as you can find walkway that connect Ayodya Hotel from the South to Club Med in the northern part along the beach. This route is about 7.5 Km vv. It is a pity that the walkway is not that wide, so you have to zig zag occassionaly. It is not 100% private I guess, but not that open to public."
Miranda B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Nice beach which is kept clean. One of the nicer beaches in Bali plus lots of resorts along the beach to stop off and get a refreshment.
Anuranjan S,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2015,This is the beach to be in Bali  if you are looking for some time to relax and unwind away from the busy streets..more so because unlike other beaches...this one is not overcrowded and you can enjoy many water sports activities too !!
Chris C,"Backwell, UK",Oct 2015,"If you're planning on spending your cash on some adrenaline sports this place is ideal. As a beach it's high pressure sell sell petrol fumes and nothing else, so don't go."
Judy F,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2015,If your looking for para sailing or any type of water sports than this beach is for you.   Very popular with tourists and the place to start your adventure to Turtle Island and snorkeling. Fun place!  
Mildrody,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Feb 2015,It's very nice when you go to see sunset or evening. the blue sky is so clear wind too. in near they have place to walking around.
Jayburd78,"Tayport, UK",Sep 2015,"Beautiful beach, nice and clean and very relaxing, few sellers but not too annoying, plus plenty of water sports."
HugoColle,"Evergem, Belgium",Oct 2015,"One of the best beaches in Bali in my opinion. A long sandy beach with possibilities to swim, do watersports, walk, sunbathing.. Theres a long walkpath along that beachside which connects all the big hotels there. A nice and safe way to explore restaurants in neighbouring hotels. There are people who sells the souvenir stuff and other things but they keep within limits and dont bother you too long. Relaxing place.."
tawon26,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"White sand, relaxing beach (in some area), just enjoy beach+sun, need only sunblock, drink, and ...good mood"
su88882015,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"this beach is very good, bring your family  then they will have good fun and want to go back for weekend with family and other fam. also you can visit the beach with picnic lunch boxes so you can save some funds, use your own transport even better,"
Ttuurreekk,"Atlanta, GA",Oct 2015,enjoyed just relaxing on the nice sands of the beach no interruptions. the water was warm and very clear and you could snorkel in the water but I did not so I couldn't give a review on that part
Desislava Z,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Oct 2015,"Unlike Kuta, this beach is very beautiful and clean! The sand and surroundings are great! There are a lot of entertainments on the beach and also some very nice restaurants/bars with pools."
Igor C,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2015,"If you want a nice and relaxing place to swim in Bali this is the place... clean water, nice sandy beaches, lots of bars with good priced food and drinks...Not a party place and no full bogans around screaming, nor annoying people selling stuff in your ear....Also this is the place to do some water sports like Jetski, parasailing and so on..."
rajsreviews,"London, United Kingdom",Oct 2015,Absolutely beautiful beach with hotel resorts lining the coast. It was nice for a sun bathe and a cheeky swim in the sea. The beach is quieter here than in other parts of Bali we visited - probably because it is taken up by resorts. I'd definitely recommend it if you want a relaxing escape.
Andre_C,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Oct 2015,"The water at this beach is so clear and the sand is very nice, relaxing beach and of course safe. a lot resorts nearby where you can try the bar ...lual "
Daniel&Amy,"Rotorua, New Zealand",Oct 2015,"If you're used to the stressful salespeople covering the majority of the tourist beaches in Bali, come to Nusa Dua beach and relax! The beach itself is beautiful, and the water is crystal clear. Swimming would be great for kids as the water isn't too deep and the water is also pretty warm. If you're keen for a day out around the beach there's plenty to do - check out the hope gardens, the agendaz club (free swimming pool), and the Bali collection for food!"
theprincessandqueen,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2015,Nusa Dua Beac is one of the cleaner beaches Bali has to offer. If you are staying at beachfront hotel in Nusa Dua you will most likely have access to a private section of the beach which will be even nicer and well maintained. Nusa Dua is less of a tourist spot and attracts more of a refined crowd. Would recommend if you're not looking for too much bustling activity.
Darnel-HDI,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,The beach Semenanjung Nusa Dua is calm. It is quite nice to walk or run along the beach side either in the morning or before the sun set. There are only small path way as so many hotel built on the beach side. Generally the beach is clean and the environment is well maintained.
David D,12 contributions,Nov 2014,"Nice beach if you like the huge resorts that line up the whole length. Takes away the Balinese quality, I could be a beach on he Medieranean or any other over-touristy beach destination"
CubicletoReef,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,"The beach is picturesque, and there are plenty of restaurants and bars including those attached to the long line of luxury hotels overlooking the beach. Lay back with a drink on a beach recliner before enjoying the clear, warm blue water. "
ABryceT,"Seoul, South Korea",Jun 2015,"My wife and I stayed in Nusa Dua, at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort for the last three days of our honeymoon. The beach and the resort were beautiful. the perfect ending to our Bali trip."
Michiel B,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2015,"Beautiful beach, but the water is too shallow to swim in and there is a lot of sea weed as well. We were a bit disappointed."
Thomas H,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Oct 2015,We walked the full length of the walkway along the Nusa Dua Beach every morning after having enjoyed the sunrise. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the local people setting up their shops and stands as well as meeting all the other visitors on their respective morning jogging or bicycle ride.
Sarah T,Perth,Jan 2015,"Lots happening on foreshore, nice vibe, lots of hotel sun beds and cabanas as many hotels have ocean frontage"
Bambang Ismanto,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"We spent 2 nights in this hotel including gala dinner in near beach facility. It is very good hotel in term of services, facilities and good surrounding tousrist areas."
Jaymie18,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,great for water sports and fascinating scenery!  We walked along the shore and appreciate the white powder sand. Nice white beach pictorial =)
mgdgmgng,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,"great beach for sports, a fair bit of rubbish near water's edge, also some nasty rocks in actual water so care to be taken."
SigitaVilnius,Vilnius,Oct 2015,"Nusa Dua area is nice and clean. The beach is long and sandy.At 11 am it was empty. Maybe because of low tide? We walked 100 meters to the sea and it was still impossible to swim :( Dead coral reef first and then some kind of vulcanic rocks (?). They are not sharp, but doesn't feel ok.As soon as we reached a spot, where the bottom drops down and it is possible to swim, the big waves scared us back to the shore again.Well, this is nature, but it's a pitty, that we came here with a purpose and had nothing good of it."
steveamcb,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,"Used this beach a few days, and found it to be very pleasant with clear, clean water.  Most of the hotels have buoys about 75m out and recommend that you don't swim out further.  There wee no strong currents as often found in Kuta. "
Amir R,"Tehran, Iran",Oct 2015,"the beach is a safe and good place for kids,familes but not the best choice for surfing and water adventures. if u are looking for some peacefull romantic place do not miss nusa dua beach specially in the evenings. u can grab a drink and enjoy the scenery."
Shahnawaz N,"Bengaluru, India",May 2015,"Beautiful beach, clean and vast. Waters are clear and place is idle for beach sports. A hangout with you sweetheart is the best treat."
AussieAussie77,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,"Lets be blunt - a lot of the beaches in Bali are not that great. Think Kuta and Jimbaran - any beach in Australia is better. Nusa Dua is the exception - its a beautiful long stretch of beach. The sand is nice, the waves not too big and the water clean.The beach is lined with 5 star resorts. They all have water sports available for rent - like jet skis and kayaks. If you aren't staying in a resort some of them will still let you hire their equipment. Just go into the hotel and walk through to the beach. Best to call the resort first to check though, as the resorts are sprawling and its not that easy to walk from one to the next if you wind up in one that doesn't have equipment for hire."
VladBull,Romania,Oct 2015,"Very nice beach, clean and big. The water is very hot and with little waves(or at least i was lucky to catch it like that) but full of seaweed."
M M,Florida,Oct 2015,"Great sandy beach.....super for long walks.Water is clear...BUT EXPECT TONS OF GARBAGE (plastic bags in the water like I have not seen in any other part of the world.....)Huge disappointment !,,The hotels famous names like: Hyatt,  Mercure etc etc.....should invest in maintaining the beaches clean.....all they do is dig a hole in the sand and dump the trash...then cover it....NOT ACCEPTABLE! Shameful ."
Theo1526,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2015,"Somehow I was amazed that the pool water is so warm and it makes us feel relaxed and rejuvenated after using the pool. The food around the pool is just perfect. It has direct access to the beach and it is what makes it very much enjoyable. They are building a new restaurant now and it was under construction when I was there. I will come back to give a try. very nice bamboo looking restaurants! We were taken care of the Manager, Mr. Erawan. He is just the best! Anything you need to ask, Please come and ask him, He will guide you to know more about the hotel experience. Thank you Mr. Erawan!"
GT-martin,"Terneuzen, The Netherlands",Oct 2015,Nusa Dua beach is inside a hotel complex where you would either see tourists or hotel personnel. The hotels are quite packed with each other as well.
Rrixon,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Nov 2014,As a couple we loved Nusa Dua.  If you want something away from the hustle and bustle then this is the place.  Its a very relaxing area and great for couples wanting to chill out.  The resorts are all very beautiful with peaceful secluded gardens and little bali huts for relaxing massages by the beach.  All of them have beach chairs set up with shade and service on the beach for drinks and food.  Loved it!
SubhashDJ,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,"Very calm, quiet and clean beach. Near to Nusa Dua peninsula island. A big statue of ""Krishna & Arjun"" can be seen from long distance. You can experience turbulent waves dashing against porous sandstone rocks in a thrilling view. Beach is safe for bath.Walking disatnce from Nusa Dua main market place."
natalie b,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"A most tranquil and beautiful beach in Bali. Golden sands, Palm trees and crystal clear waters make for a most enjoyable and tranquil visit."
beachaussie,Collaroy,Aug 2015,Perfect for peace and quite and service. Drinks very expensive unless you have local Bintang Beer. Food expensive but cheaper if you use SPG Card. Service and staff amazing. Not much night life but no hustle and bustle like Kuta. Lots of water sports.
Jessy S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,Clean beach but there is not much water during low tide. So you should check tide chart before going to the beach
Diane A,"Mandurah, Australia",Sep 2015,"Clean, white sandy beach.  Very quiet and private.  People were have marriage ceremonies there.  Also camel rides."
trevorpaterson,"North Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,We decided on a water experience that delivers thrill and excitement and that is what we got.The double para sail was an experience nice to share the experience of thrill and views. The flying fish was also a great experience well worth the visit if you like water sports
sunnykullar1968,"Chandigarh, India",Oct 2015,A clean and fresh beach lagoon with very calm waters. Corals after 30 meters can be hurting. Great for evening strolls
samuelp82,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,Some parts of the beach are bought and maintained by the different hotels so non hotel occupants are not allowed to use that area.
Tommy2124,"Motherwell, UK",Sep 2015,"Nice long safe beach, with various patrols. Great area near the monuments to watch the waves break through the lava flames.Wear appropriate footwear if going out to the reef at low tide ."
Selina K,100 contributions,Sep 2015,"Clean, beautiful and just right. The sea tide gets very low in the evening, so watch out for sea urchins! "
depti70,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2015,"The hotel have loungers food, drinks which made this beach perfect very little hassle from vendors so you could sleep in peace !  Staff extremely friendly, quick service for drinks and food from the beachside restuarant, breakfast on the beach was a great way to start the day."
Lisa  S,Australia,Sep 2015,When its low tide.........its low tide - no swimming.    BUT take reef shoes if you  have them.   We were restricted to sandy areas only during low tide.  
Micko W,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2015,Great views of the ocean. There is often many different ships and yachts in the distance. One time there was what looked to be a fleet of US War Ships.
Louinsydney,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,We only used this beach near to our hotel/resort. Very clean and pretty beach. Lots of water sports available to do. 
TFCF,Sydney,Sep 2015,Beautifully manicured beach. Clear protected waters. Great walk along the water front to watch the locals in the mornings. 
Maui Thepoortraveler,Philippines,Aug 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is one of the nicest white sandy beach in Bali. The shoreline is good for those who wants sun bathing and walking.
Dalestacey,"Fort Worth, TX",Sep 2015,Enjoyed one day here.  The water is crystal clear.  There is shade and the Marriott provided us transportation to and from hotel.  A quick little ride.  A must do when in Nusa Dua.
Katmo1864,"Los Angeles, CA",Sep 2015,"Beautiful, long white sandy beach. Stunning! Great for long walks and watching the waves. Not good for snorkeling."
upkudonirastreet,"Jacksonville, FL",Sep 2015,It's s great sandy beachWater is niceIt's much better for surfing as there are some monster breaks not far from sureNot great for casual swimming as the currents can be extremely strong I do not recommend swimming there if you are not a strong swimmer who is aware of and able to handle currentIf this is the case stay in one of the beautiful pools
Nada M,"Prague, Czech Republic",Oct 2015,"Long white sandy beach sharing between more hotels but still big enough to find you own place. Clear water, just be carefull of strong currents. "
FeetForTravel,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,"My family stayed at the Novotel Residences for the Nusa Dua part of our trip. Each hotel has a private beach that belongs to the hotel and then there are ""public"" parts of the beach too. Just to be clear Nusa Dua is an area and there's a long stretch of beaches along the Nusa Dua area. I swam outside the Novotel stretch and walked up as far north as I could go. The water outside our stretch was clean, clear and lovely however extremely strong rip heading north and for a seasoned snorkeller, this is NOT the place to seek your tropical underwater adventure (try the islands for that). The reef here has been destroyed, we spotted ONE clown fish in a lonely anemone. As you head north, when the tide is out, you can't swim at all unless you want to walk out through the rocks and seaweed. My advice, find out where you want to stay and then ask the hotel about the beach area, some hotels have direct beach access, some, like Novotel, you need to catch a shuttle which is easy enough."
Vicky H,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Beautiful beach to just relax on. Perfect for all ages as it's so calm. Plenty of watersports available for those who want some adventure. The local sellers are all very polite and friendly.
Yrolg,120 contributions,Oct 2015,"We were stayed at Kuta, we took kura kura bus from beach walk to DFS then transit to nusa dua, return tickets cost Irp 140000 pp, the beach is clean and not crowded, but we can't find any Balinese rent the lounge chair! So end up we join the agendaz beach club, NO entrance fee there, we just need to buy food or drink in the restaurant, we only paid for Irp 150000 pp for meal and drink, and the coffee was buy 1 get 1 free, then we can use the lounge chair and swimming pool. During afternoon low tide, most of the beach was just ankle deep. We enjoyed a lot, highly recommend!!!"
rub_the_rhino,"Queensland, Australia",Oct 2015,Went to Nusa Dua for something to do. The beach is nice but it is a bit boring. I can see why it might be nice if you were staying at one of the resorts but not worth a special trip. We are spoilt for beaches in Queensland but I just found this to be dull. It's clean and so is the water so that is a plus but don't travel just to hang out there. 
ilovefrance12,"Whangarei, New Zealand",Sep 2015,"We were staying in Sanur and visited Nusa Dua beach during a day trip. We had a lovely swim here and found the beach to be not too busy, clean, and the water pleasant. "
Kate2112,"Barcelona, Spain",May 2015,"We stayed at Westin Resort, their part of the beach was beautifully cared for and clean. The resorts swimming pools are fantastic but if you like some waves and clean seawater this beach is ideal. There are very few vendors on this beach, they do not harass or badger you to buy their wares or experiences."
Doyleygirl,"Harpenden, UK",Sep 2015,"Gorgeous beach, which stretches for many miles.  Though the sand is white, the sea is not always as turquoise as the pictures make out.... "
nanda0425,"Severna Park, MD",Sep 2015,gorgeous beach and sunrise! love to be walking on the boardwalk and look at the spectacular view. incredible people and food....
4EvaMakinMemories,"Blaxland, Australia",Oct 2015,We visited the Nusa Dual Water blow on the Nusa Dual Peninsula Island on a perfect sunny day. The view is great however be visited at low tide. The water blow was still active however the water was not splashing up as high because of the low tide. I suggest to visit at High tide and chances are you might even get wet. Only a short walk from Nusa Dua Beach and resorts. But be careful of the sharp rocks and don't get to close the edge.
Cheryl K,"Greater Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is great fun - tide in or out. Great swimming in warm waters and you can snorkel too. There is a lot of room to set up on the beach without feeling cramped or having your privacy invaded.  Refreshments are never too far away and check out the lovely ladies selling sunnies, sarongs and hats- great variety and prices. When the tide goes out you can walk along where you were swimming earlier. Enjoy watching the locals raking up fresh seaweed and fishing with their traditional baskets too - magic, and I think I had some of the seaweed at breakfast the next day."
Shantanu Jalgaonkar,"Pune, India",Oct 2015,I was here on the beach in Oct 15. Most of the places on beach is reserved by five star hotels. There is only one place where you can rent a bed. Massage on beach was one of the best. The beach is amazing.
G N,"London, UK",Oct 2015,"We came from Ubud and stayed in Nusa Dua - the beach definitely gives us an immediate resort feeling (particularly moving from a busy Ubud center).  The beach is a great chill out place to get some tranquility with decent crowd of people.  Can do some surfing, swimming with less crowd.  Highly recommended."
Ross R,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2015,While we were there the beach at the Grand Nikko was closed most days due to strong rip along the beach front. 
srminchina,"Shenzhen, China",Oct 2015,"clean and uncrowded, a delightful retreat from the dogs and seediness that is present on Kuta beach.  Much slower pace and not so many vendors selling useless things to tourists."
Lisa F,"Karalee, Australia",Sep 2015,"It was a fun day. Did banana boat, parasailing, fly fish, jet ski, snorkelling and visited turtle island. Got transfers from hotel included in price for a total of 500000rup each. Parasailing was off the beach which was surprising. But it was good, easy and fun. The hardest bit was going up and down rocks. Fly fish was ok, the lighter you are the more you go up so I didn't go up as much as the kids. Jet ski was fun but almost whacked my head when the guy was steering and they needed more of them. Turtle island has a 20000rup donation fee each to visit which we didn't get told about so it was lucky we had the money cause we weren't bringing much. Sunscreen needed and toilets are below average but I presume they are constantly wet."
Arselie M,"Los Angeles, CA",Oct 2015,"My finance and I spent two weeks exploring Bali and this was by far our favorite beach.  Super fine white sand, gorgeous views and plenty to do.  There was a lovely breeze that kept the temperatures nice and it was easy to find a coushioned lounge chair in our out of the shade.Big disclaimer: this is an absolute resort town.  Very Vegas-ey style hotels, some trying to be more ornate than others but the beaches themselves are well mantained and perfect for relaxation.There were a few vendors coming by with sarongs, massage offers, and water activities.  The jet ski vendors were really pushing hard since their time is more limited for business.  The tide goes out in the afternoon starting around 1-2pm and becomes ankle deep all the way from the shoreline to the safety boueys."
FNula,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2014,"My first and last time in Nusa Dua. This is a place that was never meant to be a beach and lacks any natural beauty. That combined with the wave upon wave of five star concrete edifices resulted in a place lacking in any charm. Perfect for business, but not for a beach holiday."
WSH83,"Kuching, Malaysia",Sep 2015,Really nice beach especially if you book at hotel that has private area. But it does not have sunset as it is facing west. The beach is calm and less wavy. It will very quiet area if you enjoy privacy.
silkyzoe,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach in front of the hotels is kept clean and traders are few however get away from that area and you come across lots of rubbish washed up. Plastic bottles,seaweed that smells and other things. I know the seaweed is natural but all else needs attention"
inkypete,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Nice beach with serious tides. The water is clean compared to the other tourist areas (Kuta/Legian) but a fair bit of kelp. Nice to paddle but not a good swimming beach.
Claire C,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,"large beach made of soft sand , ideal for children to play on and not crowded. the water does not have any waves so ill not frighten little children."
Shelley C,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,A total contrast to beaches on the West Coast of Bali.  Beach is long and clean with relatively few hawkers. Sand is obviously trucked in by the high end resorts - you can feel the difference when you are out the front of the better resorts.
184Anna,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2015,"Since we were staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel we spent some time exploring the area which included the beach at Nusa Dua. The beach was lovely, clean and rubbish free.  The water was warm and safe for swimming probably not great for surfers because of the reef close to shore but great for families."
bethaniaphung,"Bogor, Indonesia",Aug 2015,Go try water blow in Nusa Dua area. Waiting for the water hit the rock on the edge of the bridge and when it hits the water will goes up.
Joy M,327 contributions,Aug 2015,"Really relaxing beach for swimming. Even if you aren't at one of the Nusa Dua resorts, this is a great beach for swimming. Plenty of warungs for good food too!"
Amelia W,10 contributions,Sep 2015,The beach got many seaweeds and plastic. Im talking about the beach on Ayodya Nusa Dua. Its beautiful if maintained nicely.. what a pitty.
Abhay P,Mumbai,May 2015,"Lil bit expensive. Most of the outlet own by a private hotels, so you have to pay for rides to get in. Our guide had connections with the local outlet and I could go in for sneak preview, and a discount was offered. But we were not in for water sports and so we decided not to go in.That was good decision as I observed the way parasailing is done. We had done parasailing in Tarkali in India and at Pattaya, Thailand from moving boat and platform in sea. But at Nusa Dua, they hook you up while you are standing on beach sand and ask you run. The boat pickups speed and you are dragged a bit. The worst part is landing. When you are about to touch the ground 2-3 guys jump on you to stop and hold while you are getting dragged. Lot of tourists get injured, bruising on hand and on legs are common. It's very dangerous.Go on your own risk."
Jeffrey C,52 contributions,Sep 2015,It a nice place to relax...You can spend the whole afternoon at here..The seaside is clean compare to other beach at Bali and sea is clear as well.
mandywu,singapore,Sep 2015,"Good to come here with kids, water is very clear and not deep,no much water sports.  We spent one hour here, kids enjoy in playing sands here. "
Rabbito1983,"Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2015,"We enjoyed the watersports did jetski, banana boat & parasailing. They will be flexible on pricing so barter & get the best price!! Its pretty kaotic on the water and on the shore with all the tourists in and out of their activities so its not at all a place to go to relax, swim or sunbake! Aside from the watersports we would not go back there."
Irvan17,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"most probably the best beach in Bali, cause it's clean, not crowded, a bit too expensive s most of the outlet own by a private hotel, but well worth it"
Yasemin U,1 contribution,Sep 2015,"on september 12, we came to nusa dua snd could not found any sea side similar to the pictures.no area to swim"
ronaulikasih,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,Clean..... Love it .. Compare to other beaches... It's my fave one ... I can spend most of my time here
The_Rock_50,"Mount Pearl, Canada",Sep 2015,"If you`re staying in the Nusa Dua resort area, it is a must to do the walk by the ocean.  Great to do in the morning for the exercise, the view and for the experience.If you can get up early enough to watch the sunrise, it is spectacular.  Do not forget your camera...  Note that the sun rises above the horizon about 20 to 30 minutes after the first daylights.  The first day we went at sunrise, we left too early thinking there were too much clouds and the sun was already up.  The second day we stayed and found out the truth... What a show!In the evening, you can walk and enjoy a meal at a variety of places (resorts) along the way, with the sound of the ocean, the vibe of the people around and also some live music.It is important to know there is a presence of quite a few security guards along the way to give a feeling of safety in this restricted area of the resorts.  This is a welcome feature when you`re walking in the evening."
Mike M,"Hatfield Peverel, UK",Sep 2015,Fantastic beach with lovely white sand and beautiful clear water. Good safe beach for children although the tide does go in and out daily.
suej5956,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2015,White sand - very clean.  They grade the beach every day.  Waves crashing over the peninsula was a highlight.
Tony_Karner,142 contributions,Sep 2015,"A very nice complex in a very nice corner. Kinda exclusive area too for most travelers. But since they have an open area too, so it was OK to visit. Hopefully they keep maintain even make it more clean as I still saw many garbage in that little island!"
laurie m,",elbour e",Aug 2015,This is an amazing beach beautiful white sand that stretches for miles. You are able to walk on a footpath or hire bikes. The path takes you pass all the wonderful resorts on this side of the island. Lots of places to stop for a meal or drinks lots of water activities offered as well.
Tarek B,"Alexandria, Egypt",Sep 2015,I stayed at laguna hotel the beach is nice and the atmostphere is perfect for relaxation . One note is that due to tides at sunrise you will find litteraly no sea by the beach become swamps all the way up to a barrier couple 100 m away . This effect is till 8 pm . Quite a disapointment if wanted to have a sun rise dip in the ocean 
jimbo778_2000,"Harpenden, UK",Sep 2015,"As our review is based more as a comparative, I would firstly just mention that we visited the following beaches while in Bali: Kuta, Seminyak, Jimbaran and Nusa Dua.Obviously Nusa Dua beach is a fairly large stretch of beach and therefore our views might not encompass the whole area...although we did go back a second time to a different area still on the same beach.Overall, I found this beach to be clean and the waves weren't too big as I did actually manage to go for a swim. However, the currents are quite strong and you need to be careful with weak swimmers or children. There are also far far fewer interruptions from sellers than some of the others like Kuta/Seminyak.The first time we visited we paid 200,000 for two sunbeds with an umbrella in a hotel complexes private area. As a result we had no interruptions and were able to go to the hotel for lunch and a swim in the pool if we wanted. To be honest, I think we could have maybe bargained them down but we didn't bother.The second time we paid 50,000 for two in a different area of Nusa Dua and this was on the public beach. We were asked about massages and offered other goods for sale but not too many times and they were always polite and left us alone when we said we weren't interested.."
John T,"Balclutha, New Zealand",Sep 2015,Beautiful beach that seems to stretch on for miles.  Our access was attached to the Novotel beach club so there were also actives included.  The water in September is like a warm bath. 
Norazelin,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2015,"Once my flight ticket to Bali was confirmed, the first activity that crossed my mind is Sea Walking! I don't swim and also don't dive, so this is the most suitable activity for me to discover underwater world. LOL. I would say it was a gamble visit to Nusa Dua without any booking for the water sport activity. We arrived at 10.30 am, and walk in to the one of the water sports activities agent. I don't remember what's the agency name but we were surprised the cost for the sea walking is USD120 per head and just left the agency and went to another agency, Watermark. Here, the cost also is quite expensive but after a long negotiation session, we were so lucky to get only IDR 1,000,000 for 2! It's a local rate! My advice for those who wants to do the water sports activities, please book in advance via online booking, much cheaper compared to walk in price. Unless you are lucky like us, you will get a good bargain :). Another thing, please bring along your gopro to capture underwater moments or else you have to pay another IDR 1,000,000 for  them to capture your pictures and videos."
Omar M,5 contributions,Sep 2015,Amazing beach with amazing activities and water sports where one can enjoy the sun the fresh air and the activities
ros301,"Newcastle, Australia",Aug 2015,"Nice yellow sand beach. Plenty of water sports available when the tide is in. No waves so not suitable for surfing, but nice for swimming once you get past the broken coral at the water edge."
messyw10,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,"Beach has a lot of seashells which cover the entire lower stretch of sand before hitting the seawater.  This made it near impossible to walk to the beach without shoes. A suggestion may be for hotels to clean up the stretch of beach which they ""occupy"". "
Seat_0A,"Schoorl, The Netherlands",Sep 2015,"This stretch of beach is a wonderfully clean beach. They even sweep the beach every day. There is a reef just off shore, so the water is reasonably calm. Snorkling is great too. "
RossoDiavel,"New York City, NY",Aug 2015,"When high tide, it's nice yellow sand ( not white ) beach but during low tide there is no more swimming or any water activities "
Zenmaster777,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2015,"Kuta maybe where the action and noise is, Nusa Dua is the quieter beach. It is relatively cleaner and far quieter beach to spend the day. It is fewer hawkers, and those that are there leave you alone. The children can play freely around. Though when the water goes down in low tide you have to be careful of the rocks and any dangerous sea creatures in case you step on them."
John C,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Good beach for families n very safe for swimming but tide reveals large coral n detracts from all round enjoyment definitely not for surfers
masaofc,"Azabujuban, Japan",Jan 2015,Fairly quiet beach amongst many beaches in Bali. Nice atmosphere with first class report hotel.バリの中では静かなビーチ。一流、高級リソーとホテルが付随した雰囲気の良いリゾート
George D,272 contributions,Sep 2015,"Nice and quiet beach, mainly hotel guests and not many hawkers. They aren't pushy anyway. Just pretend to be asleep! See is great when tide is in. Nice to spend the evening here sipping on a beer surrounded by fire torches."
DavidRudder,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2015,"Nice beach with white sand and the wave so calm fortunately. there are alot cafe or bar arround also to have drink and food , especially have bintang easy and relax to get sun "
Bellebali,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2015,"A beautiful spot to relax, lay back and doak up the rays. Clear water, white sand and chillin out is easy"
Sean B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Apr 2015,"Nice beach, pretty quiet and relaxed. There aren't any real waves and the food and drinks are expensive but its close to the mall so you can get your shopping done and get some beach time in one trip"

AWorldView,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2015,"Great fun with water activities like jet ski,parasailing,bannana boat,fly fish and many others on this beautiful,clean and amazing blue waters on the Nusa Dua beach...must spend at least a day here on this beach whilst in Bali !!!"
jogeshlulla,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2015,Nusa Dua beach is a nice clean beach and great for water sports. It is a lot cleaner and quieter than Kuta. I would recommend this part of Bali if you are looking for a quiet time.
KXCAUS,London,Sep 2015,"Beautiful calm waters, lovely aqua colours and not too deep so great for taking a dip without massive waves.  Most of the Nusa Dua beach area is private beaches belonging to big hotel chains, so great if you are staying in one of them, if not, then you are restricted to a few crappy sections of the beach without sunloungers.  Very relaxing beach environment with no street vendors to harass you.  be warned though, there are only hotel bars and restaurants along the beach with prices that are higher than Australian restaurants (and not always as good a quality)."
Abhilash Sahoo,"Pune, India",Sep 2015,"The peaceful, cleanliness and serenity of the beach is incomparable. Nusa dua is for luxury travelers. Its awesome"
Diverdoon,van bc,Aug 2015,"We were staying in the Canguu area close to Echo beach but liked Nusa Dua much better, Its all about sand color and peacefulness . Good loungers at a good price and fully serviced by local beach restaurants."
Shirley C,"Oldham, England, United Kingdom",Nov 2014,"What a gorgeous beach, hotel was fab nothing can compare to this hotel The Laguna a luxury collection resort and spa all inclusive, swim up bars and restaurants' where all amazing would love to go again and again"
Loeneberga,"Prague, Czech Republic",Sep 2015,"Located on the South-East peninsula it is a very quiet place to relax. There are many five-star Hotels to choose from (I can recommend highly the Conrad Bali), but due to the outer reef and tides, swimming is possible only during high tide. The beaches in Bali are nothing special, and Nusa Dua is no exception. Anyone after a really nice beach should skip Bali."
foxsaken,Malaysia,Oct 2014,"A place to dive and swimming all day long, all the wisata ( water sports ) can be found here with a bargain price"
Jo L,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,We stayed in The Mulia which is very close the Nusa Dua beach. Part of the beach is limited to resort guests only so it's not as noisy and crowded as the Jimbaran beach. Water is clearer too.
Sari H,Serbia,Aug 2015,"Had a fun and exciting day there. Did jet ski , para sailing and banana boat ride. Great time and very helpful guides assistance. Explaining the process from start to finish. A definite to do if into water sports"
Lea W,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Nusa Dua is the Bali's posh resort with big hotels but I saw many locals heading over there for the beaches, especially when it was low tide and there was more space on the beach. I'd definitely recommend the place for a good chill on the beach and an adrenaline rush if you go with a scooter through the airport bypass expressway."
terry s,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,if you want rest and relaxation stay or visit this area.so much different to kuta or legian.just dream and have fun.
Alex J,"Athens, Greece",Aug 2015,"10 years ago, this beach was a a beautiful long stretch of sand, with some waves - now it has been spoiled by the various hotels who've decided to create supposedly picturesque (and tourist-safe) little bays protected by wave-breakers. In reality, the waters are muddy and sea-weed is constantly swept ashore (and the hotels have countless people sweeping and burying this weed). Besides that, these hotels (many of which non-guests are prohibited of entering even to use the cafe or restaurant) occupy all the beachfront, not allowing independent restaurants or cafes to offer their services. "
Savalicious,Melbourne Vic,Oct 2014,Beautiful tropical beach with clear warm water. Very well maintained and safe for the kids with minimal wave and current activity.
Isabel B,"Heidelberg, Germany",Sep 2015,"The beach is really nice, but you should go there in the afternoon. The sea looks a lot nicer then and there is less sea grass in it. Sunbeds and umbrella are around 50k rp."
Nanontour,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2014,"Beautiful beach near the Ayodya Resort, but watch out for the 'hawkers' selling their wares, unless you really want to buy a beach sari etc.....but they can be annoying.....they are not allowed past a certain point of the resort, so it is only if you are walking on the beach that they can be annoying......BUT the beach is CLEAN and lovely and was not overly busy with people when we were there."
Joannes Rhino,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Nice calm beach. It's where the high-end society normally likes to hangout. Highly recommended. It has access to several nice spots, like waterblow, cultural park, hotels, restaurants, museums, shopping center. Overall, you can find almost anything nearby. "
msihua,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Lovely quiet beach, with loads of European tourists sunbathing (meant that everyone was enjoying their own quite time and space). Brilliant!The only downside was that the water was very much covered with pebbles and sharp rocks (be careful), but the water was clear and blue!"
sam0man,"Muscat Governorate, Oman",Aug 2015,It was a THRILL - my first-time fly fishing and parasailing! The banana boat ride and jet ski were equally FUNtastic! Thanks to the staff and professional experts who made it all seem quite easy and in safe hands.
Liliana258,"Hamilton, Canada",Aug 2015,"There is something you should know about Nusa Dua Beach.  While it is always fascinating to look and provides excellent facilities, there is high tide and low tide.  At low tide you can make an inventory of everything you were stepping on trying to make your way into the water.  This is not the Carribean, there are interesting water creatures like nasty looking seastars, and some garbage always is being brought to the shore washed by the waves.  The view of the sunrise and the walkway along the beach make up for it though. You can walk, bike, run the long path connecting all the hotels on one side the gardens and the other the view and breeze provided by the sea."
Simran S,31 contributions,Aug 2015,"We traveled here for our honeymoon and stayed at Kayumanis (which we would highly recommend).The water was so clear (you could see right through it).  The weather (August) was really perfect.  Not too hot (low 80s F) and also a nice breeze.  Wonderful!But if you are looking for a lot of nightlife, there isnt much.This is pefect for relaxation and water sports!"
dYquem,London,Aug 2015,"We had our own reserved sunbeds in front of our villa, so fantastic service.  Couldn't really ask for more.  We didn't really venture to other parts of the beach because we didn't need to."
Victoria M,22 contributions,Aug 2015,Best at high tide due to rocks in area when tide goes out. Not many food vendors. Sand quality is good.
Sirianong_serene,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",May 2015,Beautiful and clean beach. Love waking in the sunset time and exploring the sea animal in the rock pool.
Steven C,Playa De Las Americas,Jun 2015,A stunning beach to take a nice long relxing walk. Cant help want to stop and take in surroundings. Lots of bars and eating places on the beach and there is a fantastic place to get a very good cheap massage! 
crosschap,london,Aug 2015,"We highly recommend Made Chepot +6281 338 174 561 He collected us from our hotel In Nusa Dua ahead of our pick up time and helped us plan our itinerary, ensuring we went to the places in order of how busy they would be and the traffic to get there. His car was very clean, great air conditioning and very spacious for our family of five. He over ran his time booked with us as we wanted to visit a temple right at the end of the day. He was friendly and cheerful all day and knew all the short cuts. He is a family man and very professional."
Christiana T,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Aug 2015,Clean Beach.. white sand but the water is to strong and you cant swimm just relax and enjoy the view!
TheTravelingSun,23 contributions,Aug 2015,BEACH is what i love from vacation and this was a pretty one. it was relaxing not much vendors and i love the sand and clear waters
OZS_ATW,"Budapest, Hungary",Jan 2015,It is a nice beach but there are some stray dogs like everywhere in Bali.... You can enjoy a a beautiful sunset from the beach! That is great! :-)
FaisalNM,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2015,"We went to Nusa Dua for the water sports activities. Most drivers have a ""setting"" with the water sport service providers. You can negotiate as much as you want and most times, you can crack the deal. Important to check the changing rooms facilities and the toilet cleanliness before you book your water sports! We made this mistake, our place did not have a changing room and the toilets were extremely dirty. Gets too crowded at times with groups queuing up. Plan about 2 hours extra on your budgeted time. Overall, a good experience as our kids enjoyed it. We found many luxury hotels here and I'm left to wonder how the guests will enjoy their privacy due to the over commercialisation in this area..."
Diana M,"Crowborough, UK",Aug 2015,"Lovely beach, fine whitish sand, warm water, wide beach. Nice resort area. This is one of the nicest beaches on Bali."
Umar F,Colombo,Dec 2014,It was a good decision for us to go there when the sun was setting. You do not get the best view of the sunset since it faces the opposite direction and therefore it's best to catch the sunrise. Nevertheless the visit was well worth it.
JGC14,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is a long stretch of sand, suitable for swimming and water sports. There is also a nice walking path so you can easily walk along the beach and all the hotels & restaurants. "
Looweese b,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2015,Lovely morning and afternoon walks...very clean lively aspect going from one resort to another.I did find it expensive  but i guess its up to what quality your after your happy to pay.
Jean Stephane R,"Budapest, Hungary",Apr 2015,Very clean sea shore with small places where you can have very romantic evening and have a drink. some of the place proposed some live acoustic music which makes the evening even more pleasant. The water is warm and waves can be quite big if you would like surfing.
willjelbert,"Somerset West, South Africa",Jun 2015,The white sands of this clean beach makes it a great chill out spot. Lots of water sports on offer by the surrounding hotels and good restaurants to visit at night. No harassment by folks trying to sell their goods.
Alexander F,32 contributions,Aug 2015,"We had been in Inaya Putri (around Hyatt, Novotel, etc) and walked there a few times. But everywhere the water was not that nice for swimming. Many mussels and many seaweeds. Beside this it is a nice beach with mainly big hotel chain resorts where you can relax and enjoy the beach. Overall it's nice, but not that special as the reputation. "
Subhasree789,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Clean and calm beach, good time spent early in the morning. DOnt forget to take your SPF, hat and sunglasses for the beach!"
CareyPearson,"Berlin, Germany",Jul 2015,"Stayed at a hotel right on the beach at Nusa Dua. We were advised that some beaches in Bali can be disappointing. You won't be disappointed with Nusa Dua beach. Great for evening walks, with white sand. "
Dpradhan,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Sunset, Coconut or ice cream, may be just a jog. You will love it all. nice and clean. Yes good enough to spend an evening if staying close by."
jlabreu72,"Porto, Portugal",Aug 2015,"Probably the best beach in Bali, clean water, great sights and lot's of very good hotels and restaurants."
Sumil_D3,"Bengaluru, India",Sep 2014,"Did scuba diving, para sailing, banana boat ride here. This beach has the cleanest water in bali suitable for underwater activities. Have to bargain a bit on the packages but you can have a lifetime experience in here. "
meenu a,Pathankot,Dec 2014,"White sand Geger Beach (Nusa Dua) is a definite visit in any tourist's checklist when in Bali... Beautiful and clean. Specially recommended to be visited during the day. When here, get wet during water activities and don't forget a visit to the Turtle Island. Note: Please do negotiate on prices for water sports and Turtle Island.The ride to the Turtle Island was very exiting. A secluded conservation site with beautifully raised turtles. Its an amazing experience to watch the life-cycle of the turtle, from the young to the oldest, off-course other animals also get their fair share of viewers."
llsaPortElliot,Port Elliot,Jan 2015,"Lots to do nearby with many eating houses, massages and peaceful strolls.Nusa Dua is away from the hustle and bustle of the major tourist area in Bali offering a relaxed and lest stressful experience."
Cristian B,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"The sand is white and the water clean very nice beach the get sun,arround the beach also there are many restaurant so easy to find food and drinks "
cenk_iz,"Lyon, France",Aug 2015,It is a white sandy beach with full of mid and high level resorts along. If you want to swim you should avoid going there in the afternoon otherwise you will face a swampy place due to low tide which is not reflecting the turquoise blue pictures at all and you will be disappointed.
Romeo S,"Mascot, Australia",Jan 2015,Nice and quite beach with not too many people. Sunrise is always great and good track for jogging in the morning
AlbertN101,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Lovely blue water. Saw lots of marine life the kids were specially interested in a bunch of crabs and starfish. Very shallow and clean, found some mussels and an interesting bunch of shells."
NathiOslo,"Oslo, Norway",Mar 2015,"Beautiful long beach even with hotels the whole shore, shallow water, great sand and very funny things in the water at low tide"
Carven W,"Naarden, The Netherlands",May 2015,Love the beach is clean and water is clear. We enjoyed this beach so much we were here everyday. Not busy and is a great family beach.
jh_panjalai1306,"Saba, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Visited the  beach many times,always enjoy a swimming and it's surrounding so much . No vendors hassling.."
Chris C,"Norwich, UK",Nov 2014,"Very nice quiet and fantastic beaches, a lovely place to walk along the beach and enjoy the loneliness of the whole place  all to yourself"
MC3T3,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2015,"Long stretch of sand with numerous hotels/resorts having their private beach there. Quite clean, very calm and warm water as the waves break on the reef out in the sea. Shallow water though, not really possible to swim close to the beach. Nice promenade along the beach, numerous hotel restaurants and beach cafes as well.  "
Vincent J,"Breda, The Netherlands",Aug 2015,There are some nice resorts along this beach. the beach itself is white sand. There are almost no waves as the area is protected by canal reefs a few hundred meters out from the beach. The beach is not spectacular - most people stay at the resort pools.
ankit a,127 contributions,Mar 2015,"The white sand beach is awesome to hang out on the beach, the sand is rough, but one can enjoy the pristine beauty of the place.Mostly all beaches are private beaches maintained by respective hotels, Theres water sports provided by the hotel on charge basis and also one gets towels for use (free of cost, the hotel at the time of checkin gives u a card for the same)"
debbie8484,athens,Sep 2014,"Nice scenery, not very good for swimming though as the water is too shallow and Thera are strong currents"
Jillian P,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Mar 2015,"Visual beauty, clean beach clear water. Just overlook the various sellers of jewellry and fabric items or enjoy their banter."
Peter F,139 contributions,Aug 2015,The beach was easily accessible and clean. There are places to sit and get basic drinks. Some people selling trinkets but not too bad.
Susan B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2015,"Too many people taking parasailing which is $40US for like 5 minutes. If you want to go to a beach for a day, get your driver to bring you to the resort side of the beaches."
eyee5,"Omaha, NE",Aug 2015,"Clean and beautiful beach.  Lots of vendors selling kites, shells, and sarongs for really cheap.  Really a good place to relax."
KerrinR122,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Jul 2015,Amazing. Very busy. Plenty to do for the adventure seekers who like water sports. Or just relax on the beach.
Monika W,"London, England, United Kingdom",Aug 2015,This is really nice beach it is not authentic Bali beach but other beaches has dark volcanic sand -this beach have nice sand is long and big there is many luxury hotel and very quiet ...
Lilicubely,Singapore,Oct 2014,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore. It was the third time to Bali, so we wanted to stay at a clean and quiet beach, with no vendor bothering us, and where kids could swim in the sea. Purpose was just to relax.We found all this in Nusa Dua, although the area is secluded and the beach could be anywhere on the globe, as there is no specific Balinese taste when you are on this beach. But we knew it and just wanted to experience this for 5 days, not far from home.The sand was clean and blond as well, very nice. We could swim in the lagoon where the water was clear and pristine. There is a promenade along the beach, connecting all the hotels on this beach, most of them of high-end to luxury. The architectural design of most hotels fits well with the nature (wood/local style). The hotel buildings are also usually set back from the beach. So the natural seafront landscapte is relatively more preserved than on other sanur or kuta beaches.Of note, in South Bali, we find most beaches crowed, dirty and full of vendors that are very anoying sometimes. Some may say the vendors are part of the local experience. Agree but when it disturbs you, it is not pleasant at all. As for Nusa Dua beach, only 2 accredited vendors per hotel are allowed to sell stuff on the beach to guests and most of them are very polite and relatively discret."
Serhan T,46 contributions,Feb 2015,"I didn't feel I am in authentic Bali but somewhere very isolated and modern so wasn't my taste at all. Plenty of luxury hotels located in beach front and an unpleasant beach experience, "
jeica8,"Seoul, South Korea",Sep 2014,"Nusa dua beach around Hyatt area was better than I expected.Bali beaches are not famous for blue water but Nusa dua beach was blue enough for me to actually go in.It is not Thailand or Malaysia blue but still much better than Kuta, Legian area beaches."
Cornelius Palm,"Vienna, Austria",Jul 2015,As the main beach is completely stuffed with luxury hotels it is not really possible to get a cosy place in the shadow. But the resorts are worth a look and it is interesting to walk next to all the 5 star hotels. If you go to your right hand side coming from the parking space and follow the pathway for around 500 m you can lay down under palm trees in the shadow. 
j01216,"Spa, Belgium",Aug 2015,Nice sand but dirty beach... Many massage center and bars.. Very quiet but the water is not deep at all..
sradha s,17 contributions,Aug 2015,"If you are coming to Bali for the blue waters, then Nusa dua is the place to stay. Stay in one of the resorts that have private beach. The beach towards swminyak, legion and kuta have become very dirty. Though there isn't much to do in Nusa dua, you could easily travel to the other beaches through radio taxis. These taxis are very easily available and run on meter basis, just download the app and your life becomes easy. Most of the hotels, restaurants and spas have pick and drop service so that also makes it very easy for a traveller."
wputri1991,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Aug 2015,It's a great beach to enjoy the water when it's on high tide. Not deep so recommended for kids or family.Not a sunset beach.Don't go when it's on low tide cuz the beach will looks dirty because of seaweed
AnnRoseC,"York, UK",Jul 2015,"beautiful sandy beach and clean (very, very salty) water! loads of water sports, nice bars & restaurants. "
stkaren1960good,"Oak Flats, Australia",Jul 2015,"Sand so clean and white.,Tractor cleans the beach every day.water so clear.The staff at Grand Hyatt wash all the  deck chairs on beach every day. loved all the lady's who sold cloths at beach so friendly."
Kris B,"Aylesford, UK",Aug 2015,Sorry not what we expected. The sea was warmer than where we were staying but full of rubbish. I would not swam or surf here if you paid me too. Bail beaches not living up to past expectations. Not many people here and no water sports which was a plus.
RMartinSDXB,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Mar 2015,"Basically no waves, a small beach but a really good place to relax, Nusa Dua doesn't have the party environment of Kuta but its has its own charm and personality. The place is not the cleanest (sadly) but its way cleaner than the west coast beaches. If you want a family environment, this might be your place...."
BlueSkyHolidayss,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"We went as a couple for a family wedding to sofitel nusa dua beach resort. Complete fairytale wedding treat. The resort has excellent hospitality,  superb fresh breakfast, high quality rooms and service's,  good wifi, good luggage storage, superb spa center, also has facility to hv shower after u hv checked out and u need to freshen up bf leaving fr airport. The hotel has shuttle fr local shops,the interior deco has superb wood work. Swimming in sea and pool is excellent too. My only suggestion as a visitor is that they shld organise the room numbers in a more organised way with a better number direction board on each floor. This resort is worth every hour and everyday. I recommend couples..family's or sole person to visit this resort..safe and relaxing beach. Complete relaxation resort."
Ken R,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"An expanse of clean white sand lapped by the ocean tides make this an ideal beach for a stroll along the sand or just reclining on the sun beds provided by several hotels which are adjacent to the beach. My children just love this beach because at low tide they can explore the rock pools for crabs and small fish and collect sea-shells.Not a good beach for swimming as just off-shore are several hazardous large rock outcrops, consequently there is no surfing or merchants selling souvenirs, drinks etc, which makes for a very pleasant and relaxing few hours.Several new restaurants have sprouted up in the area which provide a welcome midday and evening meal. Try the Bebek Bengil for a delicious crispy duck dinner at a very reasonable price."
Wilson C,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,"Whiter sands and a quieter beach, but the sand is not as silky soft as Kuta. Water is very clear. It's surrounded by posh hotels, so most stretches of the beach are ""private"" access through one of the hotels fronting the beach. Great for sunset strolls!"
Damiandecanha,"Krugersdorp, South Africa",Jun 2015,Great beach... We stayed at Club Med and had our own private beach which was well maintained. The beaches sand is awesome!
Gerri m,Australia,Jul 2015,"Nusa Dua Beach is a very loooong stretch of beautiful beach.Warm water, clean water and near all your water sports.I love the fact that you can litterly walk from one end to the other and look at some Amazing hotels along the way...stoppoing for refreshments as well."
stellabow,"Shanghai Region, China",Jul 2015,"One of the best beaches in Bali, it is also the most preferrable area visitng in Bali. Many five star hotels along the nusa dua beach and have their own beaches so guests can enjoy the time over here. very beautiful view. Sands are okay. Love the sunny blue sky with clouds, nice to have the picture. "
Bettina K,11 contributions,Aug 2015,"If you want to relax in luxurious, calm and relaxing surroundings I would recommend this place. Keep in mind the place is totally resorted but peaceful. Join the sunset!. And go to pirate bay"
YorkiePom,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,"Water colour is beautiful and blue, sand is golden, you can walk quite far out and it's still fairly shallow so great for kids...also no hawkers bothering you, no jellyfish, very relaxing...my only complaint is the litter. Walked into the ocean to see floating plastic carrier bags, juice cartons and chip packets....PLEASE put litter in the bins. I actually went down the beach collecting some litter in one of the plastic bin bags, a lot of the holiday makers just looked at me in amazement, litter is everyone's problem whether on Holiday or not!  A tractor goes up and down the beach at least 2 times per day raking the sand and the Grand Hyatt does send out a couple of guys who have big bin liners who try their best to pick up the smaller stuff.That aside it is a relaxing place to unwind and just around the corner at The Bay is a beautiful turquoise cove which is perfect for kids too. Would love to be back there now, sitting on my sun lounger under the shade of one of the trees."
Jon L,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Mar 2015,"Beautiful, clean, white sandy beach. The currents in the sea can be strong so children need to be watched."
Ann J,"Tamworth, UK",Aug 2014,Lovely beach to spend the day on. Sea is gorgeous and lots to do. Nusa Dua  very friendly place to visit. Eat at the Bali Collection for good quality food at a reasonable rate.
shytjan,Jakarta,Jul 2015,"Perfect place for a quiet getaway. Hear the sound of waves, feel the cool sea breeze. Fly a kite, build sand castle in the afternoon after sea water level subsides"
Margaret1942,"Limerick, Ireland",Jul 2015,It is a quiet well surpervised beach. Bus to bring you there and back which help when the sun is hot. Stand at the edge of the water and you are in heaven. The little restaurant is being upgraded but the drinks are cool and refreshing. Prices great. Oh to be there now. The white sand so clean and the water safe and clear.
MrMarkMrMark,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,"A beautiful beach, but each visit we notice it is becoming more and more about dollars, with beachside restaurants not wanting you to take your time eating and enjoying the scenery.The water quality is deteriorating with rubbish, so we didn't swim here, but it is a nice walk along the beach.We don't stay here any more as you are captive to your hotel, with only one small and expensive shopping center in the area."
DSS,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2014,"Nice clean beach, ideal for swimming and water sports.  Not all beaches in Bali give you this luxury."
Mickeymoo72,"Brighton, UK",Jul 2015,"So beautiful, great sand, clear water. Vendors are very friendly and respectful. Great place to spend a day."
Elif P,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2015,"Be prepared for the tide. There are times that there is no sea in the morning due to tide. We were there for a couple of days. There was wave at all times and water was not clear. Only the area at the left side of nusa Dua was more suitable for swimming, but such a small area. Yet the good thing is it is not crowded at all. Feels like private beach. At night it is such a boring place. Better to stay in Ubud and have a drive to Kuta for swimming."
AnnJo,147 contributions,Jul 2015,"No word can tell the beauty, must witness this place and will instantly take my breath away each time I come. Too bad it is commercialize heavily, and after a young coconut and a pizza, the bartender is not too happy if we keep the seat and do not order further....I come here for the view, the gentle breeze of wind, and the gentle pat of sea water waves on my feet, and to soothes my eyes from business letters & reports.....what a treat..  "
Sim E,"Timisoara, Romania",Jul 2015,"Even if the area itself it's nice and clean, the main disadvantage is that you have there low and high tide. For example, from 10 days, in 5 we had water in the sea only until 11 AM. In the next days we had until 12, growing up to 3-4PM in the 10th day. Not quite nice for a beach holiday. Also, there is full of venomous snakes that can be seen when the water is low. The remain in the lagoon. My husband saw one next to him even when when there was a high water level. "
colin s,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Our third time to Nusa Dua . A few traders , but lovely people and know when to leave you alone .An amazing spa , used it twice ! Safe swimming .dining on or beside the beach . We'll be back .❤️❤️✈️"
Nadeem B J S,"Lahore, Pakistan",Jul 2015,"It is quite and very good beach , you can go inside safely , rocks are also there . Water is clean , lot of water activities are there . Vs Thailand beaches ,it is better . For relax day it is good ,not very crowded ."
inostran,4 contributions,Jul 2015,"I stayed at the Laguna resort that sits on this beautiful beach and I can really say that it is worth a visit if you do not stay in the Nusa Dua area. The water is shallow, sand-based, calm and therefore swimmable. People complain that the water goes out due to the tide however how can you complain about something that occurs due to...nature? Beautiful, clean and well-maintained due to the number of resorts located along its walk!"
gsmock1967,"Jurong, Singapore",Jul 2015,"Not the cleanest, but far, far from the dirtiest I have been on. Very pleasant to walk along and enjoy the sea breeze and blue skies."
Camelia L,"Province of Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2014,"If you want to be amazed by the underwater nature and breathtaking views, you should take time for scuba! Plan your trip ahead and don't miss Lembongan. "
EleniYi,"Nicosia, Cyprus",Jul 2015,"Just a good beach mainly for surfing. EXCELLENT VIEW as in most of the beaches in Bali. Not as busy as expected. Kuta beach is much more attractive, busy and nice. TOP BEACH is the Seminyak Beach not Nusa Dua."
muchlishakim,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Quiet white sandy beach. Clear water, low waves, but watch for the rocks at some part of the beach. Surrounded by 5-stars hotels, restaurants and beach clubs. Not much visitor when I was there."
Kate S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,Clean white sand on this beach. Lots of large resort style hotels on this stretch of private beach. Kids clubs for children (and some adults). There was a good fun vibe on this section of beach. Some of the resorts do not allow visitors even for a bite to eat which was rude given that it is a private beach and locals do not have access. 
Payangan 1969,"Okinawa City, Japan",Jul 2015,Beautiful place to spend family time. Very clean and great places to eat. Head down there during sun rise and walk the whole bean to get a good feel of the place during this time of day. Also one can walk out when the tide is out. 
amirfakhry,"Tokyo, Japan",Jul 2015,"Im not expected to see the blue water! Should came earlier to swim here, the view is brilliant. Really recommended "
Moon moon,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"I love Nusa Dua beach for its relaxing ambience, so different with other beaches in Bali. All of them have its own characteristic, but Nusa Dua beach is very suitable for those who seek quiet and relaxing time on the beach."
Janto Widodo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"The view is superb , the white sand beach is so natural, and its not too crowd . But sometimes on holiday season we found some trash in the water that need to be cleanes up"
Maureen B,10 contributions,Jul 2015,"the security, the beach and gardens were impressive.A lot of traffic ,but to be expected due to holiday season. Watching your choice of taxi transport . Only used Bluebird as it is known to be metered .. "
Annabelle P,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Beach is very nice compared to Kuta. I do wish the rubbish was removed from the water but this is a problem all over Bali, such a pity for such a beautiful island."
Sentlenyana M,"Busan, South Korea",Jul 2015,"Firstly, there are better beaches to see in Bali. Nusa Dua beach has white sand and calm waters. The only issues for me were that most of the beach is taken over by high class resorts so it's difficult to find a spot where you can rent a chair and umbrella and chill out. Also, most of the restaurants along the beach front are super expensive and don't have a chilled, beach vibe. If you're close by, take a stroll along the beach but don't expect to be blown away."
DaisyO2014,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,Some areas are really beautiful and other areas you can not swim in the ocean. So do your homework if you want before you come. The stretch in front of Westin Sheraton is all great!!!
DcaliIII D,"Dallas, TX",Sep 2014,Best beach in Bali talking about pristine water it is just beautiful and a lot more organized than the otrer beaches in Bali..
delhiwalaNewDelhi,new delhi,Jul 2015,"Nusa Dua is very very good & neat and clean area developed very good. It has almost all the major top resorts hotels. But the best part is the big park with big statue. At the behind of this park there is a view point around the black reefs very dangerously spreaded around that area. There is a wooden surrounded view point, one can can see large blue colour sea with large waves striking these reefs making loud sound..Vinod TandonDelhi"
Sarafine,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2015,"Not too crowded, with a nice breeze.Some poisonous sea urchins too mind when entering the sea at low tide. Wear shoes."
8LavaLaguna8,"Bonn, Germany",Jun 2015,"The beach comfortable for swimming. In Bali lots of spots are nice but because of waves you can enjoy surfing only. Nusa Dua beach is exactly for families and for swim lovers. Water is clean, nice sand, no corals  "
Yianni K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"Great view, my resort had complimentary daybeds to use. Shopping opportunities from people walking on the beach and lots of water sports available."
w44566,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jul 2015,clean in the summer. not crowded. good for swimming and kids. long. very nice sand. very good for walking. romantic.
pchakravorty,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2015,"We stayed at the Marriot that had a private beach. The water was shallow and the beach were clean. Though, the water had a lot of rotting plants. We just relaxed under the shades and sipped through our drinks. Less crowd and distractions. It was a perfect relaxing getaway.

Trey L,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Jun 2015,"This is one of the cleanest beaches I have visited in Bali, although depending upon the time of year and the wind you still can find trash in the water.  There are plenty of public areas to swim or let the little ones play, as well as, restaurants to eat.  Be sure to check out the Blow Hole at the tip of Nusa Dua beach during high tide."
Jack C,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,The beach is probably the cleanest beach in Bali because it is maintained by the resorts. At low tide the mini crabs all come out and are great fun to try and catch. 
Noviaa M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2014,"than another place, Nusa Dua is quite far from middle town. but if you need some private area, you can get much here"
Henry L,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2015,Nice clean beach. not crowdedBeach divided to area which own by the hotelRelaxing beach and nice to have a sunrise
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,A long stretch of beach with five star hotels and resorts. Not many visitors here except for those staying in nearby resorts. Nice for morning or evening walks. The sea is shallow and blue. Simply lovely.
Taissnow,"Concord, CA",Jul 2015,This beach is good for just laying out or renting a jet ski. I would not say it's swimmable. The area is just not as fun as some of the other beaches like Kuta and Jimbaran. It's mostly for those staying at the resorts and wanting the view of the beach when they are in their own pools.
Rells74,"Cranbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,Lovely white sand. Very swimmer friendly. Plenty of water sports to conduct. Reef keeps water safe for young swimmers. Plenty of sun lounges to relax on. Beautiful!
Susie L,Tasmania,Mar 2015,"Im not a fan of Bali, however, we stopped her on a cruise.  We went to Nusa Dua Beach.  It was quiet, beautiful and just the most amazing beach and sea you could imagine.  Really a treat.  Not at all like the rest of Bali. "
Neil G,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Jul 2015,This is a great beach and not surrounded by peddlers as many other beaches in Bali ..many of the major hotel are fronting this beach with many restaurants in the area ..a nice place to walk along and enjoy Bali for what it is .
abvira901,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2015,Clear crystal aqua waters. water sports are great. you can cycle the whole BTDC area. fantastic. Excellent place you will come agin and again
Barnacles70,"Medowie, Australia",Jul 2015,"I did not expect to find as pleasant a beach on this side of the coast. It's no good for surfing but for relaxing, swimming and enjoying the ambience it is very good."
Leogirl731,"Washington DC, DC",Jun 2015,"The beach was calm, and clear and not deep at all.  If you don't mind a little seaweed/sea grass, you'll enjoy.  "
Connectedness1970,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2015,It might be a case of location. location and location but it's been damaged by locals and tourists. Standing in knee deep water and plastic floats by is not attractive but to have disposable used nappies around your feet is a definite stomach churning moment.
Familytrips148,Singapore,Jun 2015,"A few of the adults in our group and young children tried the banana boat rides, jet skis and the para sailing. All of us had a great time. The operators were friendly and helpful."
lktraveller13,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"Lovely stretch of beach but the sand is very grainy and not easy to go for a long walk on.  There is a boardwalk but stops after the St Regis and then ""private properties"" afterwards.  Would love to see the boardwalk extended, then one could walk for km's."
djarot p,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,don't have a public beach...so i can see what kind beach that exist at the nusa dua area...please make a space for a public beach. 
Vincent H,"Saint Louis, MO",Sep 2014,"Wonderful beach. Full of 5 stars international chain hotels. Also in few strolls, we can visit galleria and nice Nusa Dua Hotel complex"
Manikandan1987,"Kozhikode, India",Nov 2014,"During my trip to Bali, i visited Nusa Dua beach. Very beautiful beach. I tried lot of water sports like Paracyling, Scuba Dive etc for the first time in my life. Must see in Bali"
Genniekeke,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2015,"Quite a nice and simple beach. Clean. But its mainly mainly touristy.I would say there is a simple corner where you can see the beauty of the wave, I was lucky to be following a group along. Good luck finding"
Andrew A,12 contributions,Apr 2015,"One of the nicest beaches we have been too, clear calm water nice and warm. Not a lot of people hounding you like in other parts of Bali. Cant wait to swim here again"
rowQld,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2015,Second visit within 12 months and Nusa Dua Beach is so beautiful with gardens everywhere and world class resorts to enjoy all year round.  
suzana b,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"Beautiful to look at but not a swimming or surfing beach. Not a calm beach that you can swim for hours, but also not a surfing beach. It is very shallow then it gets bumpy and deep very quickly. "
Krat64,"Avondale, AZ",May 2015,"Quiet beach and frankly, not very nice. I guess those two parts make up the whole.There are a number of small restaurants on the busy street which would be the best part of this area."
Sarinah C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"This is our 4th visit to Novotel Nusa Dua, Bali. We were very happy to stay there. The environment is friendly, comfy, and very nice for family. Kids love  the beach then from beach they move to the pool.  I myself and my husband love to shop balinese clothes,  dresses, shorts or jumpsuits. All of them are pretty with affordable price at shops beside the hotel. There are also many convenient stores around the hotel. If too lazy to walk outside the hotel, the foods in Square Rest  and cake shopp are yummy and delicious. They told us that their foods are free of MSG. Ooo my goodness... what a place.... then what I love too is their wash machine..  We just put out clothes inside..leave them for some hours.. taa..daa.. they are clean and almost dry... I need not worry about our clothes for stay any longer.☺Our love for Bali..Sarinah"
Zeeniek,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2015,"Great sport for surfing, there is a channel that will help surfers get out easier with little paddeling but be careful because around noonish the current gets stronger. I am a beginner and I was with the beginners group and I wouldn't have made it to shore if the trainers didn't help me by pushing my board. the current was sooo strong, i'd paddle with all my forces and still be where I am. ( the spot is also called mushroom)"
Syam52,AUSTRALIA,Jun 2015,"beautiful white sand, private beach, very few private venders with permits.  These can be a bit of a nuisance, but they seem to be aware that they cannot pester you.  The beach is private to each hotel and there are loungers available.  "
kapitibeach,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"We had access to this beach via the Novotel Nusa Dua.  It's a great beach.  Every hotel cleans their bit of the beach but you will see some areas that aren't clean and, as there are some major tides, there is a bit of rubbish on those sections.  The beach itself is very heathy with a few wee crabs zipping around avoiding big tourist feet.Now there is a side current that runs in the water.  The waves can be high, depending on which hotel's part of the beach you have access to.  Go after high tide and keep an eye on your kids as the waves do have a pull back.  Plenty of sunscreen, you can get burnt quicker with the sea salt eroding your sunscreen faster than at the pool.There are a few touts for shells, massage etc along the beach too, so not entirely private!"
zsszn,"Bratislava Region, Slovakia",Jul 2015,"After Kuta this beach is calm watered and relaxed without sellers on the beach. The water is clear, but maybe beacause of the weather, the sand is not so messy (I saw, the resorts clean it, but there are only few trashbins on the beach) and there are mainly tourist here, than the beach is ""free breathe"", not like in Kuta, where you are ""like sardines in the can"". "
robert,"Norwich, UK",Aug 2014,"Stayed in the Melia Benoa Hotel located on the Nusa Dua Beach, quietly watched the locals fishing without being stressed out by street traders or beggars which unfortunately are many in Bali, had to put up with ""dogsbollocks"" a local offering tour guides of Bali , which we declined"
Alejandro Lopez Pinto,"Tibas, Costa Rica",Jul 2015,"One of the best beaches I have ever been to, a very special place for children, highly recommended for families with small children"
JayeshVeralkar,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,"we had access to this beach strip through our hotel ayodya. since this is private beach strip, it is quiet and well maintained. "
Sonny_Waters,"Rochester, MN",Jun 2015,"We visited this beach while staying at Mahogany hotel, the hotel provided the free shuttle, and we were told besides swimming also to visit the two islands, we did go, one island a lot of locals bringing their pets ( dogs ) from different species, if you love dogs, you could see  they walk the dogs in this island, we also visited the rock where the swell hits and turned to the fountain. It was a lovely evening."
ColletteBeh,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2014,"Went diving with friends at nusa dua. Is a great place for first trial. I really enjoy and I love it so much! It was my first time, I was so nervous. But the guidance was great, they gave me some basic training and they really do look after me. Where to dive? Jimbaran Nusa Dua, Bali!"
Debasis_Saha,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Jun 2015,"it is very nich beach, white sand, sea water colour blue and crystal, you can see beach floor, nice to swim and do watersports here....."
Prashant M,"Mississauga, Canada",Feb 2015,"excellent sky blue beach, the water is clean and clear. right time to visit is in the evenings or early morning..."
Preston S,"Whistler, Canada",Jun 2015,We rented moto scooters in Jimbaran and took a drive over to Nusa Dua. What a surprise! After a long walk past all the five star hotels we stopped to check out haze beach club. The had a lunch promo so we spent the day. Best meal all trip!
Ace-KING88,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,Water was not as clear as I had expected and full of grass quite close to the beach.  Sand was not so fine and full of small pebbles / rocks / shells. Was quite quiet though and had a lot of space to ourselves. 
mark s,"Manchester, UK",May 2015,"Perfect beach and kept very clean. Nice to sit or walk around, very safe to swim in the sea. Plenty of locals selling everything you didn't need but ended up buying - good fun trying to bring a balinese boat kite all the way home on 3 different flights!"
RameshPMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,We enjoyed a variety of water sports. The most fun we had was on the Flying Fish. We did scuba diving too and the divers were all Padi certified.
Serena d,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,Nusa Dua's beachs are the best beaches in bali if you are looking to take a nice safe swim in crystal clear waters.  Unlike the beaches in Seminyak and Kuta there are no waves so it is safe for kids and people who are not great swimmers to wade in the waters and have fun.  Make sure you check it out for that tropical island feel.
wildanlatif,Bandung,Oct 2014,Overall beach and garden area were well maintained. Clean as you go on the way to the beach and in the beach. Spending the morning till noon with family at the beach side and enjoying water sport facilities that available unforgettable experiences in Bali. We stay at Conrad Bali beautiful suite room.
Bapu R,Dubai,Jun 2015,"side of Nusa Dua beach (south side) -- No thank you. Dirty, overcrowded, nosy, more like ""ballermann"" on Ibiza."
AhPek,Singapore,Jun 2015,"If compared to Kuta beach, this is much more quiet. I was there to view waterblow, Looks kind of dangerous but rather exciting to see water gushing out from rocks."
Rizby_2009,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2015,"Wide swathes of soft sands meets clear warm waters. Surf breaks majestically far offshore. This is the classic beach, perfect for walks and just chilling. Few vendors. However only luxury hotels line this beach. Did see some trash on the beach (visited June 2015) which seems to be washed onshore by the strong currents. But there are cleaners sweeping up everyday. Also quite a bit of seaweed. Would love to return!"
Pablo_Ir,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,Fantástic beach. Good quality of sand. Very quiet and fantastic to walk all along. There is also good spots for snorkeling. Currents are ok and there is not risk while snorkeling. There are many spots to rent equipment to practice many water sports. There are many nice hotels and there is a possibility to eat or drink at the many bars next to the beach. You ca also have direct access to Bali Vollection shopping gallery where you will find many shops and restaurants.
konahi78 T,"Kaiserslautern, Germany",Jun 2015,"Very nice beach!  Long, uncrowded, fairly clean water.  Although it could've been due to tides or costal conditions.  But then again, I come from Hawaii and we have some of the best beaches and worse.  Depends where you go too.  But I digress, Nusa Dua beach is very safe for kids as well as adults.  I'd go back again. "
Surya Tirtana,Indonesia,Jun 2015,"You should walk to one of the island, where locals bring their pets mostly dogs, and there is jogging track , too."
Pelf Nyok C,"Melaka, Malaysia",Jun 2015,"Nusa Dua beach was the first destination we were driven to on our first day in Bali. Perhaps it's due to the fact that we are Malaysians (there are plenty of beaches in Malaysia), and that our profession allows us to indulge in sea-related activities pretty cheaply (or for free), we found that the fees associated to all ""attractions"" offered by operators along the beach were very much inflated. We couldn't imagine paying $40 for what looked like a 10-15 minutes of parasailing. We certainly couldn't imagine paying $40 for a 15-minute of flying fish. Or $40 for ""walking under the sea with a head gear on.""As soon as we communicated our intention to ""just take a stroll down the beach,"" the tour operator told us that the beach was not safe for taking a stroll, and then she very quickly turned her back to us and started pursuing other tourists.In my opinion, it is a much overrated ""tourist attraction"" but if you're in Bali for its beaches and ""sea-sports,"" then this is the place to go to."
WMandAG,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jun 2015,"Novotel's Beach in Nusa Dua is a great place to chill, always clean sand and clear water - great food."
Namitasanjay,"Meerut, India",Jun 2015,It is a beautiful beach with many resorts opening on to it but it is well kept and clean.It is very peaceful and serene and amazing
460janined,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach was cleaner than most in Bali, probably due to the diligence of the area's resort staff. Don't expect to be able to relax at this beach, as the locals are relentless in their pursuit of a sale (or two). Good for swimming and snorkeling. On most days we visited there was a good small break to learn to surf on (that could have been good weather and tidal luck)"
adishjain87,"Noida, India",Jun 2015,"Nusa Dua undoubtedly is the best beach in BALI, Clean and Tidy and you will find all the luxurious hotels around it.WEST-IN, HYATT,  jw marriott, etc..If you wanna sit on a chair and relax, then you need to take a room in these hotels as they have seats close to beach designated only for residents of hotels.Take a walk early morning and it will rejuvenate you ! and beauty of the beach at its best !!!AS you go through the beach and nearby area you will see why it is favorite destination for US President BARACK OBAMA !!!"
VersatileVicky,India,Feb 2015,I have never seen something like this before. The resort has 2  beaches opposite each other . Where the hell do you get to see something like that .Check out moe about it and other videos on Bali and its attractions in my channel. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCbQ2Kti8qRQ40zLjyMQCIlcl4GvhvTF
Trident18,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jun 2015,"We found a morning walk the ideal way to start the day. Even though we were on the path early we ran into cyclists and joggers also enjoying the sunrise. You can wander amongst  the beach areas of all the other resorts and enjoy seeing staff in preparation for the day. We found the beach to be fairly clean as most resorts employed gardeners and cleaners to maintain the common areas.It was also a thrill to see the areas on the beach being prepared for weddings... A perfect setting....sandy beach, sunshine and podiums decorated with curtains of chiffon and bunches of frangipanis and hibiscus.Allow a 30 minute walk before breakfast."
Little_miss_Chelsea,darwin Australia,Dec 2014,Bali beaches are not a post card expierence the pictures always look gorgeous but there is alot of rubish and annoying areas in Bali. Nusa Dua is aimed at the less drunk tourist and a touch more money. Great for watersports- if you call kite surfing and bannana boats water sports. Realy family friendly and no hawkers - nothing like the kuta beach expierence 
Saronthina,"Fuengirola, Spain",Jun 2015,"This is, by TA's forums consensus, one of the cleanest beach in Bali. Which pretty much says it all -  Bali's beaches are now for the most part detritus-filled. From the Hyatt all the way to Geger, you'll at best find spots of relative mediocre cleanliness between patches of what can only be called landfills. Floating used  diapers were so revolting we opted not to try the waters. note: The spots in front of the hotels are of course by far the better ones - but reserved for guests so if you are renting a villa you'll simply be out of luck. This is absurd - we're talking about a paradise-like natural formation absolutely ruined by the people who should be treasuring it, as tourism is by far the main source of income for the island. "
Travel Enthusiast,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2014,Beautiful clean beach for a quiet peaceful vacation. Lot of high end hotels and resorts lined up. Good place for a family get together. Away from the crowd for which bali is famous. Though away from busy bali there are options for food at decent walking distance.
Suzana M,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",May 2015,"Peaceful and enjoyable walking along the beach. Recommended for sunset...have to woke up early in the morning as early as 6.30am to see it. You feels safe as not too many people hang around the area. The beach current is quite strong, so there is a red flag, mans not suitable for swimming. I can see poeple do the exercising like joging, playing beach footall and just enjoying the environment."
DrSuz_12,"Ogden, UT",Jun 2015,"The beach is not crowded. It is easy to find solitude and enjoy the sound of the waves, which provide a natural music of their own. The view is spectacular"
Cheysa,"New York City, NY",Jun 2015,Beautiful clean beach aligned w/ westernized beach front hotels. Very relaxing aside from the locals selling souvenirs and tours.
Steffie681,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Apr 2015,"It was peaceful, perfect weather in april, relaxing. The tide gets really low around six so you can walk on the beach and see starfish, sea cucumbers, etc"
jona-mar-li,"Vienna, Austria",Jun 2015,"The Melia Bali Resort's beach, beach life and sportive options are excellent in all details, clean, beautiful and with an own beach-restaurant presenting indigenous and modern world cultures."
Mike A,7 contributions,May 2015,"A perfect place for romance, peace and love, enjoyed every moment and second of it.Excellent for couples and families."
Ferry T,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,This beach its good choice for your family. Dont forget to bring any trash to recycle bin . keep clean our beach..
GM-SBHB,"Tanjung Benoa, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Actually the Nusa Dua Beach is really large and consist of many region beaches, Nice for sunrise views."
doctorfoxtrot,"Taguig City, Philippines",Jun 2015,"This beach was not good for swimming during early morning and late afternoon hours. The surface area is quite extended that low tide is quite evident. I don't see people snorkeling or doing water sports activities except those flying kites. There is a pathway covering many high end resorts and you tend to encounter some vendors , several restaurants and those offering water sports activities. The best beach is located in the Sofitel resort area (forgot the name). This place is noted for its vaunted Balinese sunrise (not the sunset ) and it is worth waking up early past 6 am to witness and record it."
Nabil A,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2015,"The beach starting from Sofitel towards Bali collection is more beautiful, and is cleaner. All hotels (Sofitel, Nusa Dua, Westin, Laguna look to have same facilities, Sofitel offer much bigger rooms, and they are all a walking distance from Bal Collection "
ezjosa,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"Actually the Nusa Dua Beach is really large and consist of many region beaches, and what I'm going to do is reviewing the Mengiat beach which is a part of the Nusa Dua. The way to Mengiat beach is located between Inaya and Ayodya Resort. My visit was exactly quite late than I predicted before (which is to see the sunrise from the dawn), but it didn't matter because when I arrived the sun still in the halfway to rise completely and the view was still amazing anyway. After that, I enjoyed the morning beach atmosphere until 9 AM and playing with the sand. Not forget to mention, the beach is the type that I like because there was only few people here and you can really enjoy the beach, seriously!"
JGiuliani,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"Lots of space, soft sand, decent waves without being too big.  Local vendors are persistent and annoying so lacks the peace and quiet of a private beach."
Rob S,"Churchdown, UK",Jun 2015,Don't bother trying to snorkel as the water is very cloudy through sand disturbance. It is a very clean area to be as the hotels that sit on the beach have regular clean up crews. 
Peter M,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"just a wonderful place to walk along the beach, do look beyond the rubbish. water is clear and mostly calm for a swimyou can get to most hotels and shopping from the beach"
Deriardi,"Semarang, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Bali one of the island in indonesia, which are well known in the world as the island godsbesides high cultural activity, bali also has a stunning nature, If you are planning a trip to bali for summer holiday, this beach is highly recommended.with beautiful white sands beach, crystal water, blue sky, and stay in luxurious resort around this area will be an incredible experience in bali,mengiat beach location semenanjung Nusa dua, Nusa Dua is a major international enclave containing a 5 star resort in southeast Bali. Located 40 kilometers from Denpasar, besides you relax, around 10 minute drive from Nusa Dua bay you can also do a lot of water sports in Tanjung Benoa, best season to visit bali or indonesia I recommendation between April till August .happy summer holiday ... !!!"
metalaarif,"London, UK",Jan 2015,"I didn't stay that long in this beach and the reason I didn't book a hotel this area was because of me traveling in rainy season. I was under impression that rain would ruin the beach but what happened was that it didn't rain. The beach was really awesome and had great food (Nasi Goreng) and best of them all I did Jet Ski which was really great. This was my 2nd time to try Jet Ski and I need to be honest, I was more confident and I could drift my Jet Ski. However, please do remember that you do a background research on the price, these guys were offering me all sorts of water sports in DOLLAR rate which was rather expensive then local rate. Anyways beware, I am sure you can find these water sports in way more cheaper rates."
Cheryl S,25 contributions,May 2015,I liked the sidewalk that extended up and down the beach--for those of us who like a smooth walk.  lots of restaurants and shopping to choose from.
Isabella Devich... W,9 contributions,Jun 2015,"The resort is so good, but when I came there, the sea is receded so I can see the trash in the waterfront. Because of that, I didn't want to play on the ocean, just in the beach."
Pina W,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"We walked along the path of this beach nearly every day during our stay at Nusa.  It's wonderful to walk past mostly in the shade and see all the other resorts as well.It is very picturesque and seeing all different nationalities enjoying the beach is really great.You don't get as pestered here by vendors as much as you do at Kuta or Legian, in fact they are quite subdued so you do actually get to enjoy the beach.We were lucky enough to enjoy dinner from one of the resorts on the beach and it really is a nice thing to experience.It can get busy with people but the scenery is so relaxing, so do it."
Hui Yi N,Singapore,Jun 2015,"We had to pay a toll fee to visit this beach. It was clean and awesome. Soft white sand and clear water good for swimming.Water was cool, calm and inviting. Compared to kuta and legian beaches, come here if you would like to take a breather away from other beaches."
mikemada,UK,Jun 2015,"The beach has a deep fall and at low tide it leaves lots of pools. Not sure how safe it is as there are mentions of sea urchins, so wear those flip-flops! There are sea turtle nests which are protected, so it would wonderful to be around as the babies surface later in June/July "
AnitaMikalsen,"Tromso, Norway",Aug 2014,This is one of the most lovely places I have been too - we really enjoyed our time at Nusa Dua in Bali :)
fatpats,manchester,May 2015,"The beach was clean and tidy,Beware of the hawkers on the beach. They can be a bit of a nuisance especially if you try to buy just one item they push to try and get you to buy more.  Just say no from the start."
AdiDhe,"Bengaluru, India",May 2015,"I like the beach, very clean and secluded. Few more food and beverages options would be helpful, and water sports can make it  more attractive"
Julia M,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"I came to Nusa Dua when I was a kid and it was the most amazing beach I'd seen. Blue water, coral five steps into the water. 15 years later, it's terrible. Rubbish and seaweed have replaced the tropical fish that were there. I asked a local what happened and he said, what do you expect, there are so many hotels here now. It was an eye opener to think the clean, bleached sheets I love to get into are also destroying the beautiful beach that once was. "
Shin I,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2015,"The beach is very quite and peaceful compared to those others beaches in Bali. However, the only downside I have to point out is that the beach is full of seaweed.Even though there are people who are taking away the seaweed and stuff, but the amount of it just seems so much that it actually starts become bothering."
Alpfrance,"Paris, France",Aug 2014,Just a beautiful beach plenty of tourists and five stars hotels. Everything is expensive and really not autentic.
Veganlia,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2015,"I went to Nusa Dua for the day , as I walked out to the Pier and looked behind me , I was a bit confused on all the holes in the sand to add trash which consisted of seaweed and plastic which eventually was covered again with the sand . I wonder if this practice is common ? Does Bali have a recycle program ?"
Alberto S,"Vigo, Spain",May 2015,Not many people. Peace and quiet. Fully recomeneded if you are looking for to remove stressfullness from your mind.
The dust of my footsteps...,"London, UK",Jun 2015,"Make sure you hit it for high tide otherwise you won't see the fame geyser effect. A nice stroll if you're staying in one of the nearby hotels. Might get crowded. and no place to sit really so don't make it a big outing point, you'd be disappointed. Not worth a taxi ride as far as I'm concerned, unless you have young kids in your party who'll be mesmerized."
dannyvicki,"Margate, Australia",Jun 2015,This is an area you should never miss if you come to Bali it is beautiful. Their are gardens which are beautiful and full of the most beautiful orchids. To get into the area of Nusa Dua you have to go through a security check which is reassuring and it is a very family friendly place to spend time. There is a blowhole type thing down at the rocks area which people fish from and people get their photos taken when the blowhole works. It is best at high tide. Beautiful area. 
Alisha S,5 contributions,Jul 2014,It's really pretty but a little bit of rubbish washes up on shore which is sad. Look after the land tourists and Bali folk :) 
Deborah,"Nottinghamshire, UK",May 2015,liked the very clean beach. The fact it was on the hotel doorstep. Absolutely nothing to dislike. Free sun beds with parasols. Also water sports if you felt energetic.
Ashupoddar,"Varanasi, India",Dec 2014,"Although we stayed in Westin Resort which has a private beach, It was very clean and a lovely beach."
marianne j,"Oxfordshire, UK",Dec 2014,"Beautiful white sandy beach, full with hotels and all inclusive resorts.  That was our first visit in Bali.  Nusa Dua is a little bit quiet for us, but he nicest beach in Bali."
VineetChhajer,"New Delhi, India",May 2015,"Had a Wonderful time here.. Loved the Breeze and Watching the Sunset. It is Easy-Going and wasnt Crowded or Overtly Busy, An Evening Stroll here is Very Nice. The Sea Temprature was just right to Swim.Really enjoyed it"
Keith_KL,KL,May 2015,Went there during my recent stay for the first time.  It's a good beach for kids as the sand is clean and the wave break far out so they are pretty small when getting to the coast. 
Vebi-Guniawan,Indonesia,Apr 2015,"the most part of beach is cover by the hotel and resort.not many people around the beach, so if you are people who like quite and good sunbathing, this is the place for you."
Shayne B,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,Beautiful white and clean beaches and not too many vendors selling their wares. Lounges are set on the manicured grass. Bar on the beach as well as a pool
352nick777,"Jurmala, Latvia",May 2015,"Romantic,100% quiet, your heart/mind has been set at rest. Already 5 years I'm wondering this very special place between the Heaven & Earth..."
JuliavHitalktravel,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2015,a nice area to walk along and swim due to its cleanliness and minimal locals pressuring you to buy from them. safe and easy with children.
mrswaves,Maryland,May 2015,"The beach is nice..some areas rocky, some areas smoother. Lots of corals and rocks that come up during low tide. The water is warm and clearer around various areas. Find a spot you like and set up there! :) "
CliveNightingall,"Bull Creek, Australia",Jun 2014,"obviously the whole stretch of beach is privately controlled so no one apart from resort patrons are there. Took the kids on the kayak provided by the resort, had a few cocktails before the short stroll back to the resort proper"
Suzanne M,"Glasgow, UK",May 2015,This beach is not really for people that like swimming in the ocean/sea.  Its a long stretch of beach and I can honestly say that the best part of the beach/sand is where the Laguna Hotel is.  They have buoys very close to the shoreline so you cant really swim into deep water as its very rocky.
421wheretonext,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2015,Clean white sand and beautiful blue water.Balmy breezes and warm sunshine! Good food at both the Sofitel Resort and Nusa Dua Beach Resort
IndiTraveller15,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2014,Beautiful beach to relax and laze in the sun with a  cool refreshing drink. Can get hot in afternoon and  early evening. Can have a short swim and splash in water.
lynWollongong,wollongong,May 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is stunning. Lots of restaurant options along the beach and very clean area. Beach is pristine and perfect for swimming and relaxing. 
Kurt T,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,Awesome place for the family to relax. Not too crowded and the sand is perfect. Great place to have a nice walk with the family
Andrew M,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,Quite beach with lovely white sand and clear water - terrific for kids. Water quality is excellent.Backs on to most of the best Hotels and Resorts in Nusa Dua.
travelbunny0306,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2015,I really love the beach in Nusa Dua - calm and clean. And not over crowded with people and not bugged by anyone to buy anything.Suitable for kids to play in.
Carolanddiane,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,So relaxing and very comfortable loungers to lay on and just enjoy the beutifull sound of the sea also the food and cocktails were great and very friendly survice so lovely to get away and relaxe
Singlesolotraveller,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,"A beautiful beach, unfortunately the water was a bit dirty,too many plastic wrappers in the water.   Disappointing"
alexsohsg,Singapore,May 2015,This is a great place to take photos. Love the color of the water and sky. The sea current is so strong in the afternoon and the wave is just magnificent!
anupam s,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2014,"Surrounded by hotels across the island, the beach is a n escape for every single hotel guest. But if you stick to your part of the hotel, you can have a serene exp without doubt "
Marcus F,Aberfoyle Park,May 2015,"Great beach, very clean. Has a walking path between beach and the resorts that stretches from Tanjung Benoa to the north to the Hindu temple to the south. About 15km all up.Good for a walk, plenty of places along the way to grab a beer or massage. Very little hassling from locals. Outer reefs stop swell so great swimming for kids. Some good surf breaks on the reefs.Escape the west coast hustle and give the Nusa Dua side(east coast) a try"
Purplepinay,"Paranaque, Philippines",May 2015,I am spoiled by Philippine beaches so my standards are high.  Boracay and Palawan rate as 5 (excellent).  Many other Philippine beaches are 4.  Nusa Dua beach is a 3 and a half.  The sand is clean and a pale yellow.  But it is loosely packed and therefore very difficult to walk on.  The waves were quite strong so it is not the type of water that I would leave small children in.  Sunrise on this beach can be very pretty.  Sunset is not visible from this side of the island.
Ayesha H,"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",Apr 2015,Dirty when low tide. We preferred swimming in the property pool. Though it's perfect for sun bathing.
Warnasouda,Paris van Java,Oct 2014,"Very true you choose Nusa dua beach as clean and beautiful.Beside stepping straight sand, can also walk or run on tracks along the edge of along beach..Pedistrian track that is protected by trees, also some security officers who guard, so you can enjoy the beauty without fear of safety hazards.."
Sara S,120 contributions,May 2015,Loved everything food great waves super awesome costumer service location quietness n clean beach I could find everything close Transport not an issue at all
Ketaki J,4 contributions,Apr 2015,we did sea walk herehere u have many water sports and adventures options availablegreat lifetime experience of sea walk 
Mai L,6 contributions,May 2015,"I was expecting the beach to be white sand and cleaner.... Its not, so for those who are travelling here for the experience of a beautiful beach, I suggest to do some research for better beach areas."
OTIS W,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2015,"Nusa Dua has two beaches, one is for public ( sometimes rubbish flowing on water) and the other is under the management of various resorts. The Bay--- with Bumbu Nusantara, Hong Xing, Pirates Bay Bali and Ocean Walk lining along the shady trees. The security guards, with smiling faces, greet the visitors blandly. The whole area is famous for renowned hotels, the room rate of course is expensive indeed, and you can easily find a large range of water sports here. Bali Collection has an excellent shopping mall, and she frequently provides a free ride to your hotel within the area."
Vicki C,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2015,Although the usual hawkers were at this beach they were very nice and didn`t get pushy. They are all liscenced and numbered. the beach is edged with beautiful shady trees and some days enough surf if you want that.
Debdutta S,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,Great for cheap water sports - most popular water sports destination in Bali. You can bargain against the quoted rates here as well - just like for everything else in Bali 
MaiDreamsComeTrue,"Sukadana Ilir, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"The water is not wavy, the sand is pulpy cute. not as crowded like the west part of the island (kuta). If you are bored, maybe look around for water sports that is suitable for calm water, such as jet skiing, snorkling, canoing."
Hayley N,"Hertfordshire, UK",Apr 2015,private beach with waiter service which is always an added luxury! the bar and outside restaurant are right on the beach so you can eat right on the beach with lovely views. The pool is a stone throw away from the sea so perfect setting. The wow factor are the tropical gardens that this the hotel is set in and makes a perfect place if you are looking for some chill time and a good base to discover Bali from  
Dankyboy,Waikiki,Jan 2015,"Very peaceful, never crazy crowded, a lovely beach for swimming and sunning!  Soft sand and fun little restaurants.  Great for walking and exploring."
Renee S,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2015,"No path along entire beach for bike rides, nice sand, great clean water that is calm when the tide goes out, just loved swimming here, amazing corner of the earth"
intrepidus2000,"Shanghai, China",Sep 2014,its a nice beach area.  Never felt crowded.  Nice sunrise view on the beach with low tide.  Its worth waking up a little early for.
425darren,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2015,The street sellers will want some of your hard earned in exchange for a sarong or a kite. Its a lovely beach but coral washes in so watch your feet if your going to take a dip. 
Maymay1989,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2015,"The beach here is pretty clean compared to others around Bali. The resort staff do their best to tidy it up. Everyone is polite and friendly. If you're not staying at one of the resorts by the beach here, you can still hire beach chairs available to the general public. Not too many hawkers and a gentle 'No thank you' is sufficient for them to leave you be. Toilets and a beach shower are also available."
knitchic,"Yanchep, Australia",Dec 2014,"I always enjoy a walk along the beach, its peaceful and no hawkers hassling you to buy anything.  Very pleasant experience."
KeithCarr-Glynn,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2015,"One of the best features of Nusa Dua is the lack of hawkers trying to flog timeshares or sunglasses.  Although not a lot to do, the beach is very pleasant and there is a huge shopping centre nearby."
stirlinggoose,"Taipei, Taiwan",Apr 2015,The beach is clean with great view if you want to find a peaceful beach this will be your good choice. 
sunir78,Singapore,Apr 2015,Did parasailing at Nusa Dua with my daughter and wife.Great experience in that the one where we went via boat into the ocean and did parasailing was amazing... Did it in tandem with the wife & kid and the three of us had an amazing time.Do haggle with the operators as they mark up the price.Take either your mobile phone or a pocket camera to take photos when on the boat (you can ask other people who are also doing the parasailing to take photos for you).This is because operators will sell you photos that have been taken. But these photos are only 4R where as we were expecting more like 6R considering other attractions such a Bali Zoo etc give those. It wasn't properly advertised (one small note on an obscure window).You also get asked to buy 10 photos if you want the soft copies which is again a problem. A disappointing note to the parasailing experience but one that was still amazing.
barking1RedondoBeach,Redondo Beach,Apr 2015,"AS beaches go in Bali this one is probably the best. My third trip to Bali so knew already that it does not have the greatest beaches, but that is only a small part of what makes the island so great. The water is warm, clean, has some trash around, nice that it is not big waves, is tidal so expect shallow water quite a way out. Good place to be close to many other hotels and their facilities."
Sue P,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,"If you would like a lovely walk along the beach there is a tree lined pathway passing some of the very affluent hotels of Bali.  You can enter the beach walk near Bali Collections shopping centre and view the calm waters of the bay on one side and the beautiful gardens of hotels on the other,  there are soo some lovely hotel restaurants overlooking the beach where you can stop for a beverage or a meal."
Suncica1,Zagreb,Apr 2015,"In late March and beginning of April the sea temperature was 28 degrees Celsius, you can not really cool off. The sun is extremely strong, and even with sun-block, one can easily burn. The water is shallow and you can walk all the way up to the laguna reef, do bring you water shoes, the corals are rather sharp in places. Nicer for watersports and just lying on the beach than for swimming. "
Thanapatana-OOH,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2015,the surfer might like it. the good things are that there are not much of the merchants or vendors wandering around.
NUG2015,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Excellent place to walk and get exercise in the morning.  It's quiet, not crowded.  You can also see the sunrise if it's not cloudy.  "
nwk,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Clean and clear blue sea, great for kids - lots of watchful eyes along the shoreline. Only downside was when the tide went out, you were left with the seaweed and muck."
Still_Just_Relaxin,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,We stayed in Nusa Dua in October 2014. Visited the Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Spa. Great resort which goes all the way to the Nusa Dua beach. The beach is wide and clean. it runs along the back of several resorts and they keep it clean. You don't seem to get the beach pedlars like the beach in Kuta. Sitting on this beach in the late afternoon with the breeze coming off the sea while enjoying a nice cold drink is a great way to wind down.
Jlong42,"Long Beach Island, NJ",Apr 2015,"Beach is great. We went parasailing and dive walking, and then visited the turtle farm. Worth checking out for all the watersport options. Staff are so helpful and fun."
BattlestarBerry,"Berry, Australia",Apr 2015,"Coming from Australia, it is very hard to find better beaches than our own, but Nusa Asia beach in front of the resorts is very clean as they sweep it daily. During our stay it was calm and Touqoise.. The Indonesian boats and fishermen using traditional rods adds a charm we don not have in Oz. "
superstar0307,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2015,one of the best beach of the bali island perfect for relax restaurant are available shower parking all facility expected  
Katie P,"Bunbury, Australia",Apr 2015,"Safe, secure and clean! conveniently accessed from beach front hotels, we stayed at the Sofitel which offered 1st class access and views!"
Sizzlingshaz,"Reading, UK",Mar 2015,"Private beach by the hotel was so clean, comfortable beds and waiters on hand for your every need! Great restaurants on the beach - although a little expensive."
kebaliin,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Located around The Grand Hyatt, Ayodya, and St Regis Hotels, and hosts the beach club for the Amanusa.The beach is protected by an offshore reef, breaking waves which heading to the beach, so the water is relatively calm and very suitable for swimming or playing water.The beach can be accessed easily, without having to stay in one of the hotels available.There is plenty of free parking for cars or motorcycles and managed independently by local villagers called Segara Yasa.This beach was not a prefect spot to snorkeling or diving, but it is an ideal place for sunbathing and spend time reading a book with a background of the sound wavesthere are restaurants that offer food is quite tasty at affordable pricescan also encountered traditional masseurs masseuse-ready massaged with traditional techniques"
helenvyse,"Norfolk, UK",Apr 2015,I was surprised to find that the beaches in Bali by no means compare to those in Thailand and the Philippines but this was the best of them! White sand and clear sea but the sea contains a lot of seaweed which can get rather irritating. Also the sun loungers for use by the public or all clumped together in one spot rather than being spread out along the beach which is preferable to me.
colbert,australia darwin,Mar 2015,"The Weston just has everything we love. -great room, bathroom, bed huge, linen superb, and pillows the best.  Great restaurants and plenty to choose from.  Heavenly  bed on the beach money well spent.  Staff all great."
tvalentius,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2015,The view on this beach is fantastic and also it's quite reachable from Denpasar city using Sarbagita Bus.
ManojSogani,jaipur,Mar 2015,"its a long stretched beach from one corner to another touching a lots of hotels all connecting with each other, water sports, swim available at all time, looks real good"
PollyAlex1,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Aug 2014,The beach was full of trash! They cleaned it up but the workers just buried the trash in the sand....what happens during high tide???? I'm not sure why they did that but I didn't swim in the sea after seeing the amount of trash just floating around. Great to look at though...gorgeous blue colour
SmartGirlBali,"Gili Trawangan, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"Calming and serene, Nusa Dua Beach is possibly the best beach in Bali.  Water is clean and clear with nice waves that break out on the reef.  Very relaxing and peaceful.Bathrooms available.There is food and drink available as well as beach towels and chairs.  Nice loungers.  Totally worth the money!Watch the surfers a little ways out and let the kids enjoy the swimming.Beautiful!  I would loved to have spent more time here."
Adityo Dwi,Jakarta,Mar 2015,"stayed in the Novotel, their Beach is not connected to the hotel but is beautifully secluded, next to St.Regis. hotel shuttle to the beach is available every 20 minutes or so"
Punyadeep S,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2015,Probably the best beach in Bali. Pristine water and so calm. Nice place to relax and spend the day sun bathing.
Sylvia315,"Atlanta, GA",Mar 2015,"This beach is beautiful and so big! It is wonderful to sit out on this lovely beach and watch the waves break out on the reef which makes the water from the beach to the reef very calm. The beach was empty except for a very few people! Our lounge chairs at the St Regis Bali were the most comfortable I have ever had the opportunity to be in. There was a surfer's beach a little bit away from where we were located but there were boats waiting to take the surfers and their boards to the location on the reef that had the best surfing. The St Regis had beach attendants who were happy to help you with your beach towels, serve you a drink, bring you cool towels and water, serve you lunch or snacks or just about anything you needed! It was a wonderful experience each day. I would recommend a week as we were there five days and wish we had a few more!"
Jeff B,"Stoke-on-Trent, UK",Mar 2015,Nothing to dislike about this location. This is the most relaxed place I have ever been to. The beach is long and clean and had plenty of trees in which to sunbathe under
Otilia Maria K,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2015,This beach has the best waves and the cleanest water by far. One can walk along the beach for quite a while and just relax and enjoy the sound of the waves. 
madhav r,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2015,"I like the beach view and shaded chairs to relax. excellent views. shallow water. be prepared to be welcomed by lots of sea weed, its kinda irritating, you definitely dont like to swim there for long....I am not sure its like this every day or only the day we visited. open shower facility available... "
Mjames026,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Mar 2015,The area is quite clean and the beach has a great opportunity to find shells in the morning. The water is refreshing and calm. Great views of surfers in the distant.
mansanasjuana,Philippines,Jul 2014,Pretty and lively! Not much to dislike. Nice water temperature and clean. Nice to stroll along the path and check out the other hotels on offer.
Jules0986,"Munich, Germany",Jul 2014,"Beach is ok as hotels clean it regularly but the water is a bit dirty (plastic bottles, etc.). Otherwise there are a lot of hotel restaurants and bars to visit - also the small island is worth a trip (nice view)."
Challes S,53 contributions,Aug 2014,"Stroll around in the morning, you can walk across while the water is shallow.. In the afternoon the water is rising.. I prefer the morning walk, its very beautiful and the sand is very clean."
Jameseriano,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"I love this Place....Clean with the beautiful view it's really good for enjoying time with your friend or lonely just take a time.i must come back when i back to bali, it's really great memories"
DavidAdventures,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2015,"Resort's beach was well maintained, and rather empty.  Water was perfect, and the sand is nice to lie in or just walk around on."
Simone B,"Mona Vale, Australia",Dec 2014,"We thought the water would be clean, but were disappointed with the amount of trash in the water. Plus the local hagglers did not give up!"
Mohit088,"Bengaluru, India",Mar 2015,"The beach needs cleaning. The best part is at night, the beach is mostly deserted, hence can go on a long walk, sit back, relax, and talk."
ginarti,Jakarta,Feb 2015,The complex of Nusa Dua beach is surrounded by a beautiful and large garden. I really like to walk arround in the evening or just sit looking at the sea.  the left beach is covered by white sand. There is water blow on the edge of the garden
o_galinko,"Moscow, Russia",Feb 2015,"the beach is clean, white sand and no waves.Rest only tourists, not local people.Tides in the afternoon, in the morning and in the evening you can swim"
Yvette,64 contributions,Feb 2015,"Really relaxing environment, I loved the pool and that the beach is a few steps away. Good amenities withing the hotel. It is in an exclusive area so don´t expect you can walk your way out to downtown. There is a nice shopping center available for all hotels, take a shuttle that passes by every hour. Not a lot of party, bars and restaurants are closed by 11 pm. Breakfast is so delicious, still dream about the pain au chocolat. "
Fireyredspring,22 contributions,Mar 2015,"Good place to enjoy the water jet ski, flyer, banana boat, paragliding and etc.. and it doesn't come cheap."
RSN2011,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2015,"Great place to hang, not so deep. visited from my resort which had great relaxing chairs and bed along this beach. Go for Sunrise."
Thiamchye T,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,"The Nusa Dua beach is a lovely exclusive enclave fronted by many 5 star hotels.  During the high tide, the water is a lovely turquoise sahde of green.  With beach chairs provided by the hotels, each with its own perimeter boundary, it is easy to spend a relaing day by the beach.  Local massuers are on hand if one needs a massage on the spot and some hotel provide a nice pavillion for the massage too."
MadamVoyageurs,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2015,"Private and nice beach, you can find water sports but if the smell from those engine is terrible, it's a beach where u can find privacy & luxury"
Calder Angus T,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,A beautiful and safe beach that is constantly kept clean through out the day with access to numerous restaurants and activities.
expaddy,Bali,Feb 2015,"If you like to swim in the ocean, this beach offers very safe and unadventurous swimming areas.  You can't venture past a hotel's roped swimming areas unless you don't mind risking getting run over by a jet ski.    But if you are that guy who wants a jet ski, parasail, banana boat, etc, this can be a good place to rent and play.  The beach itself is big and doesn't allow hawkers to wander around pestering people (unlike the sprawl of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak etc).  This is a place of quiet.  Dawn can be lovely here, and it's possible to walk, jog or cycle for long distances. There can be excellent views to Peneeda island, Gunung Agung volcano and sometimes if you're lucky you can even see the summit of Lombok island's Mount Rinjani.  I generally think of Nusa Dua as having big family oriented resorts.  While the rest of Bali is always within reach by private tour or driver, this area feels secluded and exclusive. "
Nandha d,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2015,this beach a bit quite in the morning but very crowded at afternoon. Its a good place to jogging or doing beach activity. the wave not big.
Phil S,"Shanghai Region, China",Jan 2015,Nice beach and nice weather. The hotel is also good. Our family had wonderful time there. We hope go there again someday. 
Rony Soerakoesoemah,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"The beach still remains exclusive so nice to walk around without being hassled ... swimming still not an option in these parts, can get bit dangerous... pleasant spot to enjoy sunrises and sunsets...always a treat to bring family for those getaways..."
joyissac,"Vadodara, India",Feb 2015,"This is a good beach to relax down with a lot of restaurants and high class resorts on the side. If you are looking for water sports this would be the best place to be. But beware that there is no waves on this beach so if you like to take a swim on a rough beach or do some surfing , this is not the right place"
Динара Н,7 contributions,Feb 2015,"I like going to the beach, swim in the ocean. But maybe because February is not a season, that's why ocean was a little bit dirty."
lnbtravels,"Seaford, DE",Feb 2015,"We found it strange that the beaches in Bali -- Kuta beach, Jimbaran Bay -- were not that great, especially for swimming. There is always lots of seaweed or garbage and the waves are rough. Nusa Dua beach is a bit better -- the basin in front of the beach gets filled up with calm water at high tide (which occurred around noon when we visited in February 2015) and it's nice for swimming at high-tide. The beachfront cabanas are usually reserved for specific resorts, so it's easiest to enjoy the beach if you are staying at a resort. We were at The Grand Bali Nusa Dua and had to take a shuttle to get to their reserved area of the beach."
Matti O,"Helsinki, Finland",Feb 2015,"One of the best beaches in the world. Beautiful, tranquil, clear water, white sands. I love this place. "
j_zsag,18 contributions,Feb 2015,"The problem is there,that the big part of the beach is belobging to one of the big hotels,and You can't easily find a place for Your towel,without not to have discursion with a security guard,who will send You away.But a free shuttle service/Bali Collection Bus/is a big help for everybody."
Georgia H,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Believe it or not its hard to find a nice beach in Bali but Nusa Dua has a lovely clean beach. No waves just crystal clear water and white clean sand, not like Seminyak which has dirty dark sand. Truly plesant to sun bake and swim in. Going again in March."
Petros I,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"stunning beach, especially when calm and when the tide is high so one can swim for hoursclean, wide, yellow-sand beach with beautiful gardens behind and some shade by nice trees"
Michael Z,"New York City, NY",Jan 2015,The beach at the Grand Hyatt is absolutely beautiful and clean.  There are a lot of trees that provide shade.  No lifeguards so be careful of the high waves.
cathylakwatsera,"Manila, Philippines",Feb 2015,"This is by far the best beach in Bali after visiting several other beaches. First, there's not a lot of people and looks like you have the beach all by yourself, great place to relax and get tanned. When we went there, the waves are not that strong so swimming is ok... the beach is also clean and not a lot of sellers to harass you."
Katattack2013,"Coolangatta, Australia",Feb 2015,"Unless you are staying at a resort in Nusa Dua, you CANNOT access any of the beach areas!!!We went to the jetskiing and parasailing here, as we were staying in Legian, and not only was it was VERY EXPENSIVE, but the water was so dirty we didnt event go for a swim!!!!.. When I asked our driver to take us to another beach, he said ""Oh thats not possible, you have to be staying at one of the resorts to access the beach""!!!!! Now thats RIDICILOUS!!! This area is too far away from Kuta, Legian or Seminyak at least a 45 min drive, so definetly OVERRATED!!!Don't bother staying here, its much better in Legian or Seminyak!!"
SandyKash,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Feb 2015,"Went their in feb 2015, had an amazing time at the beach, lovely shops around at beaseach with nice balineese food. One of the most cleanest and beautiful beaches in bali. Love the golden sand and the temple atop a small cliff. Love the road around the beach to walk hand in hand. A must go place in your itinerary. Dont miss it , go at the evening time"
ANtrvlbug,"Taipei, Taiwan",Dec 2014,Fabulous restaurants and shops...bought a few dresses at very economical prices!! There were restaurants catering to different tastes. We particulary loved the Japanese Restaurant Hanabi which had incredible food that had us coming back. We also loved the Indonesian cafe Coco bali. Really good Nasi Goreng here!!
Hartimage,"Boise, Idaho",Feb 2015,"We stayed near here with the Courtyard Marriott for two nights, and walked to the beach to get some sun and rent paddle boards. Paddle board rentals were super cheap ($15/2 hrs), and it was fun, but the tide was going out, so the waves were quite small by mid afternoon. The trash in the water however...When you are on a surf or paddle board, the first thing you notice is all the plastic bottles, bags, and wrappers just floating on top of, or hovering just under, the surface. The water is beautiful, blue, and warm - it's just too bad that it's also the garbage disposal. I will say, however, that Bali is progressing in its awareness of trash and ocean conservation. It is much farther ahead than other islands in Indonesia. It is just going to take some time. I'm sure that a lot of the trash bags we picked up off the beach could have been perhaps 10 years old.The beach itself was quite clean, as most of the beach frontage is manicured by various hotel staff. We did have a very nice time there, drinks in hand, with nice soft beach chairs and umbrellas."
RVTCosta,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Dec 2014,very quiet not crowded and with full of chairs provided by hotels everywhere. Water clean but not for diving or snorkeling; calm waves; not cold. Nice and clean sand.
Marilyne1,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,"Amarterra Villas Fantastic place. Staff couldn't do enough for you they even changed menu for me with dishes I could eat. Always greeted by all staff. Rooms spotless and well looked after, grounds beautiful and well kept. Would recommend the villas, only 5 mins away from Bali collection shopping centre. beach also 5min walk away from villas, Very quiet place"
Jingxi C,"Xi'an, China",Feb 2015,"The water sport, like the prasailing, is exciting.The beautiful scenery is wholesome both to the eye and to the heart.The thrillng nightlife is new to us, including the local food and universal music.The kindness and hospitality shown to visitors by the local people."
Laxton Cat,"Cheltenham, UK",Feb 2015, If you would like to read a book and have a cool drink by the beach then it is best place for you.It is the ideal  beach for sunbathing with golden sand and clean blue sea. It is not a place for wind suffering or or water activities. There were a few hawkers around but not intrusive.
RoshiniKS,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,good for walking in the morning. You come along other hotels along the beach and get to meet people. Good thing is that you don't find unnecessary touts to bother you along the beach. I enjoyed my walks. 
LuciaPrihandini,Indonesia,Feb 2015,"Nusa Dua is my favorite beach in Bali. Quiet environment, clear water and sand although the accomodations are quite pricey but it's worth to experience"
Rubyfelixtulla,"Havelock North, New Zealand",Sep 2014,Our hotel had a separate area for the guests. Someone to hand out towels and ensure everything ok. Nice swimming beach. 
ashi_kathuria2001,New Delhi,Nov 2014,Beach is not too clean though respective hotel tries to maintain the beach in their frontage. The beach smells horrible when there is low tide.
LYNNY1947,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,Loved the beach. Staying at the melia plenty of lounges available and trees to shelter from the sun. Could not dislike anything expect humidity high in february so would have walked on the beach more
jenny c,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,Lovely beach and area. Quiet and very relaxing. The beach and water were both very clean. Lovely restsurants short taxi rides away. 
farhaanp5,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"Nusa Dua is a really good and clean beach. Its nice and quite, and has white sand and very clean water. There are lots of water activities down in the beach area. A must visit if you are in Nusa Dua."
L-Sihui,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"- 10mins walk from Bali Collection- Nice, quiet and clean- White sandy beach with crystal clear water- Watersports available but further down the beach area- Lots of beachfront hotel to choose for your stay"
Raj Saiya,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"Its a very busy and nice beach but make sure u have a good guide or good with haggling for the Sea Walker and other activities. Try the combo packages as they will save you a bit of money, Snorkel ling was not so good though"
Cow8boy,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2015,Great beach to get some sleep or get into some water sports without the rubbish of Kuta floating around you
Robin Harly,"Los Angeles, CA",Jan 2015,"Chrystal clear water, less people and noiseless. The beach is surrounded by mostly 5 stars hotels, so most people who come to this area are the resorts' guests. To access the area you will need to go through the gated entrance-no fees."
Parveen Kathuria,"Kota, India",Oct 2014,"One of the good beaches with a row of 5 star luxury hotels so that each hotel maintains the beach as a whole.standing on the beach , you also get a good view of the bali and sea ."
Irem I,"Istanbul, Turkey",Feb 2015,The ocean was full of plastic cans and trash :( It maybe because of the wind but it wasn't pleasant at all.
Sgr2940,"Brooklyn, NY",Jan 2015,"This stretch of beach is reserved for the luxury resorts in this area. The fine white sand, warm blue water and quiet atmosphere are the ideal place to relax."
Jacqui L,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"Wow it was beautiful so clean and clear, loved it. We had access to the beach from our hotel and was there everyday swimming cooler than the swimming pools"
rkchawla,"Navi Mumbai, India",Apr 2014,"Nuthing i have disliked abt the beach, loved every bit of it.very clean very nice chilled out place."
Vivien M,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,The beach was clean and looked white but the sand is very difficult to walk in - compared with beaches in Perth WA they are average but with  beaches in many parts of the world they would be considered good. There are lots of pieces of coral that get washed up and  sit on a ledge where the waves come up. They hurt when you stand on them! There is no shade so get there early if your hotel provides lounges and sunshades.
717Diwata,"Muntinlupa, Philippines",Jan 2015,"Nusa Dua area is at the tip of  Bali island so when we went to the beach, there was this vast expanse of sand  where visitors can leisurely walk. The right side of the beach place seems to be private and allotted only to three hotel owners The Grand Bali of Nusa Dua, Mercure and Marriott ( according to the shuttle driver). The left side of the island is a public beach where tourists can lie down on the grass and use the beach for free. There is a mini park at the very tip where locals and visitors would walk around."
Heba2015,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,Beautiful Indian Ocean. Clear waters and amazing view. Can sit there all day relaxing by the sea. Can be a little rough in January. 
LLAK,"London, UK",Jan 2015,Beautiful beach and stunning location! This area is more upmarket than some other parts of Bali and there are well landscaped gardens leading to a clean and beautiful public beach.
BaliAlajmal,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2014,"Beach with Sunset is beatiful, and Chep value, for backPacker Is So Cheap with adventure Traveling. any Driver Muslim Like In Arabian soo."
chelpot,Las Pinas,Jan 2015,Perfect for a walk with your loved ones. Not for swimming though. Far from where we stayed. I suggest they put more benches or cottages people can just sit back and relax and enjoy the ocean view.
Kroybazza,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Jan 2015,"I visited here 20 years ago and needless to say things have changed.  Nusa Dua now seems to be the domain of the expensive hotel - way out of my league but the beach is still a great family spot. We did a day trip and hung out at Kanaka Ocean Water Sports - did a package that included snorkeling, turtle island, para-sailing and glass bottom boat.  We booked through a local guy who got us a much better deal than if we bought from one of the road side tour sellers. There is no surf - and never will be so that makes it ideal for young kids.The snorkeling is only a few hundred meters off the beach and is great!  It is not the Great Barrier Reef but it is wonderful family friendly reef with 1000's of fish. The para-sailing was very short but loads of fun - even our 8 year old went with a guide. Turtle Island - awesome.  You may be disappointed when you first get out of the boat but hang in there it was the best hour of our trip so far.  Turtles, snakes, iguana, toucan, monkeys, flying fox and you can hold and pat them all.  Plus owls and and an enormous eagle. Not an adrenalin junkies paradise but awesome."
Shane R,"Leicester, UK",Jan 2015,"The beach at Nusa Dua (The Westin Resort) was great, it was clean, they had buoys marked out and we were informed that it was safe to swim up to the buoys. The water was clear. We enjoyed it fully, the children loved it. I would definitely advise the use of sun-screen/protection as it does get very hot in this part of the world."
MEHDI T,19 contributions,Jan 2015,try to see the sunset with a cocktail in your hand and profite about the amazing placeperfect for a couple to spend romantic time and try the water oohhhhhhh amazing
AWilson321,"Fredericksburg, TX",Nov 2014,"Most of the hotels in Nusa Dua have their own stretch of beach so its not overcrowded, it wasn't the nicest beach ive ever been to, it was average.  Lots of locals trying to sell paintings, shawls etc gets very annoying.  Top tip just pretend to be asleep and they walk right past!"
travelmaster_hu,"Budapest, Hungary",Jan 2015,"This is what a luxory beach is about!The area is closed only for the 5 star propery guest, it is a beautiful green belt far from the city's noise, this is true you pay more here, but IT IS WORTH IT!The beach is long sandy and very clean, good to be there."
TeddyBuddyTL,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2014,"All in all, it is a beautiful place to visit if there is not too many people around.On sundays, this place is just a mess. I would recommend going only on weekdays."
Achmad Maulana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2014,"nice and clean beach, few gazebo provide along the coast for visitor rest area, long beach with water blow island in the corner close to pirate bay, as most of the access thru the hotel and resort only quite difficult for guest not stay in the hotel along the nusa dua beach access to go to the beach, try to enter for nusadua galleria or from corner of club med nusa dua, by the way its good spot for surfing as well."
Hemant Sarin,"Chandigarh, India",Jun 2014,"Many hotels in Nusa Dua tourism complex have direct access to the beach and most visitors tend to spend time at the beach behind their own hotels. So its virtually a private beach. Sofitel, where we stayed, has its own portion of this beautiful beach, its clean, not too deep and clear waters. The sand is grainy, not as smooth as in Jimbaran, but not uncomfortable to walk or lie down on. Massages are available as well as some sea sport activities. These are not provided by the hotels but by locals. One can walk on the beach passing all the wonderful hotel properties. There is a cycle track too. "
el0ise2015,"Kalamunda, Australia",Jan 2015,"After visited other local beaches in Bali, I found this beach to be the cleanest and were I was happy for my family to swim in the ocean."
moorandmoor,Sydney,Jan 2015,"The beach at Nusa Dua is long, clean and safe. Compared to the ones at Kuta and Seminyak, it is infinitely superior.There is little hassle from local traders and there are lots of private beaches, being part of the many beach front hotels which front it."
jay j,"Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jan 2015,environment not to crowd and just 5 mins from the hotelstaff were so nice and everything is gooddisliked is many street seller 
Tdgoodsell,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2015,Beautiful beach and calm warm sea.not too busy.great massage by local ladies and really cheap price.experience not to be missed.
Ramble11,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2014,"As our hotel was just on the beach, we had direct access to it. The beach is neat and clean which is commendable given the number of tourists flocking this place. We loved our little walks in the afternoon and evenings. I didn’t like 2 things about this beach:First it doesn’t gets big beautiful tides as seen in other beaches of Bali. You can’t surf here (not that we wanted to). Nevertheless this beach somehow fails to give that nice and cool vibe which you get at other beaches in Bali.Secondly a lot of water sports function here, so it does gets over crowded at times. Also due to lack of proper tide and waves it is a little difficult to enjoy those costly water sports activities."
Annie S,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Feb 2014,"I always prefer Nusa Dua beach than Kuta beach. Sure it doesn't have waves to surf. But it's clean, quiet, white sand, and pretty under rated. Just beautiful. Not much people around, since most of the beach are hotel's private beaches."
David S,"Cairns, Australia",Jan 2015,"Any hotel from Sofitel to ""The Bay"" is the best beach. Dont book pass the Hyatt. Its dirty and windy. "
SteveEgg,"Durban, South Africa",Dec 2014,"Out of season, a bit too quietGood clean beach and good food.The local area around the hotel was away from any night life"
Gintaute,"Vilnius County, Lithuania",Jan 2015,"Magnificent beach in Bali. Pretty clean, covered with white brownish sand, water is light blue on a sunny day. Much better than Kuta beach. Reminds a bit Carribean beaches - white white sand and crystal clear light blue water..."
Danielle s,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"surf in the off season, there was garbage in legain but this side of island was divine- nothing to dislike here would consider staying on my next visit"
8mmSA,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2015,Great beach. Loved it!Please don't go there if you are going to make it dirty. It is one of the last remaining beautiful areas of Bali. Leave only your footprints in the sand... (Not that human footprint called pollution and litter)
ggads,Melbourne,Jan 2015,The water in Bali is warm and inviting.  Nusa Dua doesn't have the best beaches in Bali and Bali beaches as a group are not up to the wonderful beaches at places such as Broome or Surfers Paradise.
BM1346,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Dec 2014,"Once again we had a wonderful stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. We have been there many times over the last 23 years and it remains consistently good. When we weren't taking day trips away from the hotel we relaxed by the pools, strolled along the beach front, and enjoyed a variety of restaurants including the wonderful breakfasts. My son and daughter frequently used the gym and spa and also played volleyball on the beach, - I preferred to read a good book under a frangipani by the pool.Thank you to all the staff for making our Christmas so special and relaxing."
babsonite,"Park City, UT",Oct 2014,Great location and a nice way to wind down a long trip. This is by far the cleanest beach that we experienced in Bali and overall safety and security was great!
SandzDK,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jan 2015,"Free from the usual plastic detritus that covers most of Bali beaches, the beach at Nusa Dua is maintained by the various hotels and resorts dotted alongside it. Plenty of water sports available for hire from the vendors who ply the beach - jet surf, surf boards, paddle boards, paragliding etc. Also beach massage, temporary tattoos, hair braiding and the like. Close by is the ubiquitous market selling pareos, T's and Balinese curios.Beach is great to lie on and people watch from and the water just the right temperature to cool off. Toilet facilities basic. "
DaveYoung151,"Shanghai, China",Jan 2015,"Forget the Jimboran sunset or the Kuta nightlife, Nusa Dua is the top spot to relax on the beach. Its definitely worthwhile to cough up the extra cash and splurge for a hotel night or two here.  Don't bother with the polluted Kuta and Jimboran beaches.  Its the nicest, cleanest, and scenic beach in all of Bali.  Massages are decent, hotels are pumping out the down tempo trance for ambiance and the tourists vary from all over the world, not just Australians.  My only disappointment was finding this beach the last day of my trip."
Igor d,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Beautiful beach with trees for shade at places in front of the grant Hyatt (have not been elsewhere). Beach and ocean lit up at night. Several water activity hire places available. There are numerous bars in the resorts that exist along this strong of beach.
JAYNE671192,"Kingston-upon-Hull, UK",Nov 2014,The Beach looks amazing but the times we have been the currents are very strong so swimming in the sea is not advisable.  The sand near the sea has lots of pebbles rocks and stones so suitable footwear would be recommended.  These comments might be just because of the time of year we visited Bali and some beaches will be safer and better than others.
莹 魏,3 contributions,Jan 2015,"Wow, it sounds great. Westin Hotel beach is nice to relax by dozing on hired dream bed or gazebo.  Food is ordinary. "
Kayleen P,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,We went to this after seeing it on Tripadvisor. It is accessible by getting driver/taxi driver etc to take you there the Grand Hyatt NUSA DUA and then walking about 900 meters ( might be abit more but it only takes about 10 mins of slow walking) along a good footpath to the boardwalk to the blowholes... Yes there is warnings... You need to use commonsense and be aware... The blowholes are spectacular...and I found the view overall to be breathtaking...happy to sit and just soak up the scene for awhile.... Well worth the visit...there is also a few monuments that are in the area...they too are worth a visit... One commemorates a meeting of world leaders.lmwhere they each planted a commemorative tree...and one is dedicated to Ramayana ( Indonesia's Romeo and Juliet love story) overall a enjoyable visit ... pathway and Boardwalk would be accessible to wheelchairs... and the platform for viewing the blowholes is reasonably  wide and flat on the lower levels
meowcat39,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Dec 2014,"It's sooo beautiful and warm during high-tide. As soon as the tide goes out its a seaweed-filled, smelly, muddy mess."
John A,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2014,The beach is not spectacular. The sand is coarse and the sea bottom rocky. The beach does offer a very pleasant running venue. 
UKJohn88,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2014,"Nusa Dua is in a gated compound so feel very safe there. Not crowded. Beach is clean, water is calm and clear. Great for swimming. "
dbrooks25,Tokyo,Dec 2014,"This was my second trip to Bali, but my first time to tour around the southern peninsula. While my hotel was in Semanyak, Bali, I went on a tour to several sites around Nusa Dua on Thursday, Dec. 25th. It was arranged by my hotel for us to go to Nusa Dua to see the beach, and then we drove over to Uluwatu Temple (Pura Luhur Ulawatu), on the western coast, where we stayed for the 6:00pm performance of the kecak dance.  Afterward, we stopped at Jimbaran Beach and had seafood at one of the several beachside restaurants there. See details about the temple and its kecak dance performance at:http://goseasia.about.com/od/indonesiastopattractions/a/uluwatu_kecak.htm"
Karleen L,"Dunsborough, Australia",Dec 2014,"Nice beach to swim in, just a shame that the shoreline is taken up by big 5 star resorts, so there is limited shade if you are just coming for a swim. If you find Nusa Dua Beach Grill at the south end though this is a nice place to hang out after a swim. The beach is gentle, suitable for families, although there was a slight side current when we were there. Clear water. We saw someone on a SUP board so they're probably for hire somewhere nearby."
johan c,United Kingdom,Dec 2014,"This beach is amazing so clean and beautiful and the water is so nice, the sand is great. Was amazing going from kuts beach to here, made me wish we stayed in Nusa Dua area just for the beach"
Ansettgirl,Sydney,Nov 2014,This beach is beautiful - particularly at high tide.  The water is crystal clear and the sand is clean.  The little squirrels all along the beach add to its beauty.
SunseekerFinland,Finland,Dec 2014,We spend a day here on the beach. The beach is realy beautifull and we did a great snorkeling trip by boat from the beach. I woud not want to stay in the area at least for many days because it seemed boring. The beach is lovely though.
Smoothie1412,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Nov 2014,"Blue crystal, quiet, great spot for surfing or even just lying to get tan. Use the access of the private beach of luxury hotel, super clean beach and nobody almost."
nhanse73,"Fairbanks, AK",Dec 2014,"Don't come to Bali for the beaches. You will be disappointed. Nusa Dua beach has some decent views, but nothing that will knock your socks off. "
SenseiSandra1956,"Waddington, NY",Dec 2014,"The beach was wonderful! Clear water, clean sand and not crowded-Low tide was so calm and you could see the bottom- High tide had small waves that delighted the kids playing there."
Rebecca G,"Queensland, Australia",Nov 2014,Great beach to take walks on. We hired bikes and were able to see a lot more following the walking path
Georgie M,"Newman, Western Australia, Australia",Dec 2014,"Beautiful and definitely family friendly! We loved this area, a mix of locals and tourists and lots of luxury resorts. "
Waryonetwo,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,"Ok so if you are tired of the filthy water, litter and scavenging dogs, pack up and head for Nusa Dua. Cost around $25.00 in a metered taxi for a great beach day. I'd you are a little bit cunning and confident you can also,spend time at the pools of some very swanky hotels."
sanjay b,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2014,clean.....safe......very accessible from the hotelquiet....no hawkerswaves broke out way off...so the waves that came in were very small....
GlennDias,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2014,"White sand, crescent beach, a smattering of fishing boats, palm trees, peace, quiet.We patronized the Beach Club of the Courtyard Marriott, Nusa Dua both during the day and for sundowner cocktails."
Paul_A_Pavlou,"Philadelphia, PA",Dec 2014,"Beautiful, clean sandy beach, calm waters, perfect for families and for relaxing. Highly recommended. "
Nataly1111,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Dec 2014,Great clean beach with nice blue Ocean water. It is good to swim even when waters comes up or goes down
ARUN63512,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2014,"It is a nice quiet beach, I stayed in the westin resorts which is facing the beach, had good time in relaxing on the beach."
lazuzi,"Miri, Malaysia",Dec 2014,The beach was dirty full of people being herded towards the different activities available. Not nice at all. I just wish we had not wasted out time going there. The experience was really not enjoyable at all!
Vishrutta,"Doha, Qatar",Dec 2014,We stayed at Courtyard marriott.. Not sure whether low tide was a reason for able to see so many seaweeds or what but because of so many seaweeds I personally never liked to go in the beach here
Juliette A,"Meerbusch, Germany",Dec 2014,"The Public portion of the beach is dirty, the only clean parts of the beach are the private beaches which belong to the resorts.  We were very disappointed"
Ourdogrocks,"New York City, NY",Dec 2014,"Nice white sand beach and calm water.  We were at an area that is kept up by a hotel, so it was combed and kept up nicely.  Clear blue water! Great place for a calm and relaxing day!"
Carol M,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,very clean and lovely white sand nice depth for swimming and lovely to sit and read a book on and watch the fishing boats
seventeen017,Bandung,Dec 2014,"If you don't/can't dive, this is the kind of underwater activity that will suit you. Safe, and you can also enjoy your interaction with many kind of fish that surrounds you."
Recordeiro,"Florianopolis, SC",Dec 2014,"if you are looking for a quiet and calm beach to rest, Nusa Dua is an excellent choise! You can find beautifull resorts over there and good restaurants as well."
Aditya_india,"Jaipur, India",Nov 2014,The nusa dua is extremely clean with white sands and clear water it is great for swim and sun bathing too. be careful of urchins though..Its perfect for evenings on holidays;) as there are plenty cafes and restaurants by the beach and many five star properties. Its always good to chill at the beach on a comfy couch sipping chilled malibu or exotic wines watching the sun go down..
Carolyn A,"Wickham, Australia",Dec 2014,"The beach in front of the Laguna is kept free from rubbish. The water is clean, clear and the perfect temperature. I did notice a poster advising to be careful of dangerous sea urchins in the area but did not see one the whole week. Perhaps they are further out on the reef."
Terri D,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Dec 2014,"Well, if you are going for a beach holiday, this will fit the bill. Be careful in the water as there are some big rips, but stay safe between the flags and you should be okay. Lovely clean beach to stroll along. Shade, drinks, food, all available- plus all sorts of stuff from the hawkers if you wish (i.e. sarongs, dresses, massage, kites....etc) but they happily move on as soon as you indicate disinterest. No problem."
Rohan S,"Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand",Nov 2014,"The beach is a bit crap compared to those in the north.  Lots of seaweed etc, but lots of great fooderies and no hawkers to be seen"
VincentChia,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"The sea sports only for experience, and relatively pricy.If wanna experience, the para-sailing and underwater walk is a must try ... for family with kids, banana boat is available ...the rest, no point trying"
Hoomoilanen,"Tampere, Finland",Dec 2014,"From the moment you arrive there, the process will take care of you. Considering the amount of fellow objects, they succeed amazingly well. Was lured into this hell to do a bit of snorkling. That bought me 2 slices of toast and a 3-minute boat trip to one of the dozens of floating platform from which thousands of tourists (most of whom obviously unable to swim) went all-in with their white bread. For anyone who's even snorkel before, would strongly suggest avoiding this nightmare. There may be a trashless beach somewhere in Bali where one can snorkel, I just failed to find it. The trip to Gili T. more than made it up for me."
Desita89,"Prague, Czech Republic",Mar 2014,"We spent here 3 hours with our driver. There are 2 beaches. Beaches is very nice with clean and clear water. On the beach were just a few people, it was great. No entrance fee."
JackieChinNotChan,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2014,"Unlike the other beach crowded with hundreds of boats for water sports and transport to turtle island, this one near Hotel Santika is pretty quiet and relaxing. Water isn't the clearest I've seen, but clean enough to be called decent with calm, low waves. The sand isn't exactly the finest, but quite clean and free from edgy rocks. Marine lives aren't apparent there except some kelp and coral may occasionally be spotted with some tiny crabs at certain stretch.With some trees for shades, this stretch is not planted with stereotypical palms and pines which often cause the sand to be blended with spiky acorns or twigs, the sand is rather safe and comfy to walk on. Shaded benches may be rented (overpriced compared to many other beaches of different countries) and bars are available, too."
ohclaramia,"Bunbury, Australia",Nov 2014,What I disliked was having to leave.view was amazing overlooking pool and beach couldn't ask for more.
Shachi V,"Lucknow, India",Nov 2014,"In bali this is the beach if one is looking all kinds of water sports. The water is clean, sand is good. Lots of water sports are available like diving, parasailing,donut boat, banana boat, jet ski etc. More activities more cost effective."
Nicole S,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,"THis one is for all the Australian traveller, make sure you stop and meet Maria/Nyomin and the gang at this AWESOME little traditional Bali Cafe, Dont worry about the bali belly here, Home made Chips are the best, Very cheap and top quality food, prepared by Indonesians that know how to prepare western food.PLease support our friends, they have an awesome cook and you can get a ice cold mug for your beer - How good is that. Rice and Noodle dishes, start at a crazy $2-3 !! You need to check this place out - NOT Fancy but DELICIOUS!!!! Warung Maria on the Food Strip at Nusa Dua Beach!! (next to melia)"
EX_Travel8gent,AUSTRALIA,Dec 2014,"Its cleaned in the mornings.. , has grainy sand, waves are not big, great to sit on sun beds and be served if you need for drinks etc.. There is a nice esplanade to walk along "
HelenForever,"Tuban, Indonesia",Nov 2014,I love nusa dua beach much better in terms of cleanliness than kuta area. And its more private too....
Alireza S,9 contributions,Jul 2014,The Nusa Dua beach is clean with nice sand. Wave action is not strong to disturb but crystal clear water attract you for a wonderful snorkeling close to small patchy boulders. There are places for jet ski and diving too. I enjoyed stay in the area which was warm enough for sun bating and a relax reading under umbrella. Enjoy your stay at Nusa Dua Beach.
Darrin D,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2014,LOved the Nusa Dua Beach - clean and lovely views with gentle breezes - perfect to sip a beer or enjoy a cocktail on the sand
Darthduh,35 contributions,Nov 2014,"Relatively clean sand, and not as crowded as some of the others, this beach is just a place to bum and chill out."
Staessen,"Ichtegem, Belgium",Aug 2014,"great beach, quiet, wild water to look at, great so watch the surfers do their thing, also nice to take a walk with your partner"
dg3225,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2014,The beaches are dirty in this area.  It seems like a sewer or dumping operation is taking place off shore and it just washes back up.  The water was murky and I did not go in.  There is huge amounts of smelly seaweed that is not raked up.  Just not pleasant.  The Seminyak beaches were just the opposite.
AndyT,"Liverpool, UK",Nov 2014,This is a cove so has a tide and during the day it seemed to be out.  Water is lovely and safe to swim
drsagar_c,"Hyderabad, India",Nov 2014,"The beach is clean with white sand, can bicycle around along beach line to reach the point where huge waves hit the beach. Plenty of hawkers selling stuff like sarong, beachware and shells. Bargain hard...The watersports center is located here and good, Prices again can be bargained a little. Very hot and humid in Nov and dec"
Nino J D,"Ormoc, Philippines",Nov 2014,We were on a road trip on that day. We decided to head to the beach and explore the tip of the peninsula where it is called Nusa Dua. We were greeted by a few statues of hindi gods then a trail that led us to a garden with large letters - NUSA DUA FIESTA and behind are vast statues of two warriors in lime green large figures mounted on a high platform. a few meters behind is the tip of the peninsula which is composed of dead corals where the waves smash and water blows (as consequence). It has a public beach where surfing is also allowed but the waves are smaller
Pauline C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"The waves on beach were too strong early in the morning  and beach too hot after that. However the stay at the Ayodya Resort Palace rooms was excellent with their congenial staff, restaurants and spa.. "
Kaz B,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"clean, seats available at beach resort was quiet facilities were available jet skies etc massages available table umbrella for shade was great "
Neelam B,"Birmingham, UK",Oct 2014,We satyed at the laguna resort in nusa dua and ofcourse  we had access to the beach. The water was so calm and clean.  White sands.. Turquoise waters ...it was amazing! Theres a pier to stroll to and also a little peak where you can discover a hidden temple and cliffs. One of the best beaches in bali! 
Justin T,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,"Stretch of beach is long and when the tide is lower, you can actually walk quite far. Water is clear and you can see the sand bed but sadly no fishes. Sand is nice and my girls had a great time building sand castles."
MamaAndBabyTraveling,"Hamburg, Germany",Oct 2014,"If you want to spend days with non stop Sun, white sandy beach and quiet place, please stay in Nusa Dua. So many beautiful places for you to stay, with their own private beach and security is maximum and also save for family and kids. Not too crowded with local Balinese on a holiday.My suggestion is for you to stay at St Regis Hotel, you will not regret any of this experience. Next to St Regis is also The Bale if its more suitable to your expenses. And many more up such as Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, Kayu Manis Nusa Dua, Sofitel, Grand Nikko and Royal Santrian."
sig45ace,"Houston, TX",Mar 2014,"We went to Nusa Dua beach just for a bit of an outing, but ended up riding elephants through the jungle and over to another beach and back! It was the highlight of one of our children's week - she loves elephants! They were extremely well cared for and it was a lot of fun!"
Alex V,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Nov 2014,"Nice quite beach, Not as busy as legian but I do prefer legian over Nusa dua beach, a lot cheaper to"
SunSeekingSan2,"Kelowna, Canada",Oct 2014,"The beach is long and wide, great for walking. White soft sand.  The waves break out aways by a reef so they are quiet. The area from the beach to the reef is shallow to walk out on. The end of the point is park with running/walking track.  The very point is volcanic rock with a blow hole which is fun to watch. "
RJ2610,"Winterthur, Switzerland",Oct 2014,"Nice Beach but too many plants inside, not really good to swim... But is awesome to walk by the beach."
Leeanne W,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"The beach was only for sofitel guests it was lovely and clean ,plenty of banana lounges and umbrellas. Way to swim for most of the day until the tide went out. Not a lot of hassle from hawkers. Great place to relax"
paulynyyy,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2014,"We were staying at Courtyard Marriott and the private beach shared with other mega-hotels was about 5 minutes away from Marriott by their complimentary shuttle van. At the beach, lounger beds with towels as well as shower area were made available for the hotel guests. The bar is open at 10 am. Though, it seems like a private beach, there were water sports operators as well as sellers walking around to ask if we wanted any services from them as well as exorbitant souvenirs, hence the oxymoron title of my review. The beach is cleaned separately by the hotel staffs, however, there were lots of seaweeds with the waves bringing on to the beach. However, my kids did enjoyed their time on the beach making sandcastles but not so much on the cold waters of the sea."
Deborah S,"Heathfield, South Australia, Australia",Oct 2014,"The beach looks really nice, however the sand is really boggy, on a slop and impossible to walk any distance on. A little disappointing"
Robert B,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,"Quiet and clean. No hassle at all. Easy to get around, the beach could be a bit deeper for a swim, but all in all it was very good."
Adrian P,"Banbridge, UK",Oct 2014,The beaches are St Regis and The Laguna are really well maintained with plenty of privacy. The sea is fantastic once the tide is in 
Lizmarieevangelista,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"it was low tide when we went and the water was not very clean, seaweeds everywhere and a bit of trash here and there."
Andien,113 contributions,May 2014,Excellent beach behind Sofitel hotel..I ran there in the morning and love the quiet morning and sea breeze..
lynette g,Perth,Oct 2014,"I didn't like the squirrels eating food at the tables at breakfast,but loved the variety at breakfastSwimming in the ocean was lovely and clean not like other parts of Bali"
mandsc2015,87 contributions,Nov 2013,"Maybe we missed the perfect weather, but when we were there, it did not look like the above picture, rather green water and a bit dirty and cloudy.Hotels were divine, restaurants and fun factor pretty good. Surf apparently can be good too, depending on season.Beaches in front of hotel nice and raked, but not ""maldives"".Dont expect perfect blue clear seas, you will be disappointed. But still amazing experience and lovely locals - also some really good package deals include things like massages, so look out for those."
Silviamascarello,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,"The beach is nice with soft sand, but the sea is not that great (high tide in the morning for few hours)"
BABUDHAKA,Dhaka,Sep 2014,"U can ask for your requirement and U can enjoy hard drinks also.if u have previous booking , it is good for your group."
Delyth S,"Cardiff, UK",Oct 2014,"Beautiful clean beach, with water so clear and warm. Mostly occupied by the large resort hotels, but quiet areas still available"
Katerina,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"The beach is dirty due to the tide coming and going, there are tiny corals in the sand that will make you wish you had shoes on and the water is only knee high at best. The pictures look stunning but it really is not that great. There is seaweed all over the seabed, which I find disgusting. The resorts on the beach create a nice atmosphere with the lanterns and fairy lights in the evening but the beach itself is nothing but disappointing. I would not spent my $$$ to stay there. What a shame."
HungryFriend,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"there's a secret path to one of the unique sites of nusa dua beach... there, if you are lucky or on the right time when the tidal wave is high enough, you'll see water climb up to 3 metres above your head, just as the name, the water blow up high... between the rocks..."
Robert B,"Mittagong, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach was quiet and well maintained. Not much water when the tide is out.Good for a look and a walk along the paths looking at other hotels and resorts.
QueenofCarlisle,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2014,I am not a strong swimmer and therefore was very cautious when I waded into the Indian Ocean. I could see how easily even experienced swimmers could get into trouble very quickly. Not worth the risk. The area has a reputation for claiming the lives of unsuspecting tourist. If you have children...much better to stay poolside if you're staying at a hotel.
Adam v,51 contributions,Dec 2013,"One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen. The planet has so many nice beaches to offer but one of those beaches is placed there. We enjoyed our relaxed our holiday staying at ""Nusa Dua beach resort"" which I would also highly recommend."
Vania,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Nov 2013,Best beach to visit in Bali. The warm and clean water made us stay for longer. Nusa Dua is not crowded at least not  in november-december time. For those with kids I consider a must go and stay because Bali can be very crowded and annoying in certain times. Nice visit.
Kelvin87,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2014,"we stay in club med , Very clean beaches, you can see fish swimming , the sea is not deep as u can walk far away into it. awesome sea activities available with some cost."
Rosalia D,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"Nice to relax and enjoy if you are there for a holiday. It's quiet serene and very private. It's so different from Kuta Beach as its clean and you will not be asked for a pedicure etc etc.,Great for families to come for Xmas and New Year"
Devashish P,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,Plenty of water sports activities with many pricing options. Please bargain before agreeing to any cost.like i was asked to pay 70 $ per person for Sea walk i end up bargaing 70 $ for 2 persons. So you can imagine 50 % cost is extra added and if you can bargain please do.Though water is not very clear but we enjoyed a lot.
JillbeeH,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2014,"We stayed at Melia Bali, right on Nusa Dua beach.We had been using the pool at the resort but decided to take a dip in the ocean.It was like stepping into a lukewarm bath!!  But the water was clear and the beach very clean.Extremely safe for little children."
Usman M,"London, UK",Aug 2014,"Its like going from one world to another; once you enter the Nusa Dua beach its like a different world.The whole area is clean love the statues and it felt safe.If you going to Bali; this is one of the best places to get a hotel.  The whole area has nice clean, the beach is awesome and you felt like it was another part of Bali.  The people are running, relaxing and enjoying.  It felt so nice and safe.One of nicest beach resorts in the world I would say."
Wags70,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Spent the day at the beach and it was wonderful but remember to slip slop slap because even the wind will burn you and you don't even relies it's happening and we were in the shade of an umberella, the water was warm and just a relaxing place."
kevin_ward63,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,Took the kids to Bali and went to visit the 'Water Blow' at Nusa Dua Beach. So disappointed everything was closed up and the walkway was dismantled and left to reuin. The beach was beautiful though.
IrinaBanicaBucharest,"Bucharest, Romania",Sep 2014,"Large beach with great sand, blue waters, water sports to die for. We loved it. We especially like the trying the jet sky. If you go more into the heart of Nusa Dua there are some restaurants and bars on the beach side."
Adrian H,"Northwest Romania, Romania",Nov 2013,"This is a very beautiful beach with white and nice sand, clean beach and good water. Good place to stay at sun or under trees ..."
BELMONT Ipswich,"Ipswich, UK",Oct 2014,"The beach is very safe, clean, & fine sand. It is very shallow to swim in, at low tide it is impossible to swim in as it is so shallow. Boats go from the beach to the reef for snorkling."
Anand S,"Bengaluru, India",Sep 2014,Well maintained with amazing resorts next to the beach. This place gives you an amazing sunrise view. The evenings will be really nice for a walk.
SamarGhaly,"Cairo, Egypt",Jan 2014,"the beach was amazing and the water was pure, we had a great time there, there was also many water activities."
Meredith L,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2014,Beautiful beach white sand. Great for families good for water sports. we had our own beach club through novotel awesome to get relax and swim...
Cart70,2 contributions,Sep 2014,"My husband was on the viewing platform at the water blow in Nusa Dua on 27th September, one week after Leisa M below stated 'no element of danger at all'. A huge freak wave hit the viewing platform causing part of the handrailing he was holding to collapse. This resulted in him, along with several others, being swept onto the rocks. Luckily they were pulled to safety by other tourists who were standing well back. My husband required 3 hours of surgery to repair the damage and an overnight stay at BIMC hospital, who by the way were exceptional. Three other tourists also on the path required surgery and several others suffered cuts and bruises. Please do NOT consider this area as safe. "
Mark A,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"Nusa Dua beaches have blue water but at low tide are only knee deep. Having said that, if you pick the tides you will have several hours in head high water."
dennisb-0452,"Leigh-on Sea, UK",Sep 2014,Not enough umbrellas unless  you got there early. Deceptively strong undercurrent. Quite big waves. Lack of lifeguards
Stbroker,"Kuching, Malaysia",Sep 2014,What can i say bout what meets the eye in nusa dua....just heavenly and to see it is to believe....do not miss the chance to see and feel why Bali is so popular...
Merc9SLK,"Scarborough, yorkshire",Sep 2014,"We stayed at The Laguna Beach Resort which is on Nusa Dua Beach and were very pleased to discover the bay to be large with white clean sand and shallow crystal clear water.  The bay is protected by a natural reef and is tidal.  Early morning and late at night sees the tide withdraw uncovering tiny rock pools and where you can witness local fishermen walking on the seabed with head torches looking for shellfish etc.If you stand still in the water you can easily spot small shoals of stripey fish - some the size of your hand.  The water is extremely warm - enough to make you sit in the shallow areas without gasping as you would normally hold your breath from coolness upon entering!We were not bothered by anyone on the beach in attempts to sell anything to us, although we never ""laid"" on the beach loungers and only laid by the pool.  However, there is a purpose built footpath fringing the beach you can walk for some distance past all the hotels which leads to the Bali Collection (a shopping centre with restaurants)- part of this walk at night is lined with white lanterns swaying in the breeze which is very romantic.  Beyond the Bali Melia Hotel the beach becomes more public and the sand not as clean, littered with some seaweed and disgarded packaging - however, this appeared to be where the locals would sit in the tree shade and watch over their ""little ones"" playing in the shallow waters."
AmandaCfromMelb,3 contributions,Sep 2014,"It was quite and a protected beach. There are beach sellers, trying to see you everything from day trips, to sarongs and kids kites. They are very respectful and usually only ask you once or twice if you are lying on the beach or sun lounges. While you may pay a little more, we were ok as this is their livelihood and they don't earn much. I witnessed another Australian woman haggling and being rude in her interaction, which was unnecessary and embarrassing. Always be polite. The Balinese are lovely people. "
Ashish Maini,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2014,One of the best beaches you can go..be it night or day nusa dua beach gives you calm..water is good and clean..best part when u sitting on a private beach there is no dearth of beer around you.
H R,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2013,"Have a relax walk at the long beach, have to pay for the chairs & umberella if u want, the sand is smooth but a bit big wave sometimes."
Therese G,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Sep 2014,"Beautiful sandy beach, goes on forever. Views amazing. Take a good book! Great place to chill out and relax."
Bhima Subrahmanyam,Navi Mumbai,Sep 2014,"Nusa Dua Beach is excellently connected belt from Melia Bali to Lagoon to Westin to Nusa Dua resort.Walking around the Bay area is very pleasant.It was heartening to watch a number of programmes are organised through out the belt/strip.One loves to watch wedding ceremonies,wedding receptions,spl programmes for honeymoon couple etc.An excellent area one should not miss to visit when you are around Bali."
Shahtaj N,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Aug 2014,"beautiful beach, fresh air, clean water and most importantly less crowded! its totally different from kuta beaches..the sound of the wave, the bench under the trees, big beautiful kites flying in the sky makes it more majestic! if you are going for honeymoon or without kid, its the best place to spend more time. just loved it!"
mick035,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"For all you big kids at heart who want a full day of adventure on the water, this is the place for you. My wife and I did the jet ski's, donut and the sea walker which was just amazing for an underwater adventure. Will definitely do this again."
mlelsc,Ireland,Dec 2013,"The beach at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is superb, extremely well kept and pristine clean. Swimming is safe but beware if surfers are surfing and do not swim out too far in case of encountering one!"
Harvey327,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,"Great white sandy beaches, no hassling by hawkers and easy access to hotel. Easy to walk along the beach to other hotels bars and restaurants."
Hottoddie60,"Perth and Kinross, UK",Aug 2014,"Loved the food, great cocktails, lazing about by the pool or beach, beautiful people, sunsets and scenery. Plenty to see and do. "
Paul S,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Aug 2014,"A wide range of activities from swimming, massages, walking and water sports. Nothing to dislike. Hire a lounge on the beach and chill out."
Adel_Fouad,Egypt,Aug 2014,"i like the duck restaurant there ,i tried smoked crispy duck and fresh watermelon juice, it was amazing "
Vivek D,"Jodhpur, India",Sep 2014,its an amazing beach to be at and chill out... with frndz and family... wow u can just sit and relax
Leon S,"Keswick, Canada",Mar 2014,"Nice, quiet beach in a low traffic area of the island.  Probably not as nice as Kuta but waaaayyy less crowded"
haydengo,5 contributions,Sep 2014,"We did not come to Bali for the beaches, they just don't compare to many of the other beaches around the world that have so much more to offer. We stayed at the St Regis on the far end of Nusa Dua, so we only saw this beach from Geger Temple to the Hyatt. Where we were was very quiet, very relaxing and there was a nice breeze. No annoying vendors, no loud music, minimal people. On the other hand, this beach is not well suited for swimming as it is very shallow and experiences pronounced tidal changes, and there is a bunch of nasty sea grass growing all over the place and some trash and seaweed on the shore. It's not pretty. In some areas it's also difficult to walk along the shore because the sand is sloped and deep."
Robert k,Germany,Sep 2014,"Only area where the hotels have stretches of swimmable beaches. Nusa Dua Beach which is very good and superbly relaxing, They were very polite and friendly."
Ellemay 🍹🐠🐳,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"We were staying at the Amarterra Villas just up the road & our private beach area was located on the stretch of sand amongst all the 5 star hotels. There is a path that leads from one end of Nus Dua to another. St Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Grand Hyatt plus endless others are all connected along this path which makes it a very interesting stroll especially early evenings & late afternoons when the locals all come out to fish & swim. The beach is gorgeous although no waves due to the reef it was still beautiful & clean with golden sand. There is a public beach area with car-parking, umbrella & deck chair hire at Pantai Mengiat. The café  Warung Yasa Segara runs numerous reef snorkelling tours from the café. If visiting the area its a must do to try the wonderful food at Warung Yasa Segara café as its extremely cheap & fresh. It was one of the best meals we had in Bali. Just next door to the Warung Yasa  Café there is a community run massage shop which is locally run where you can pick up a cheap massage, manicure or pedicure. You can identify the ladies by their pink t-shirts."
Leisa M,7 contributions,Aug 2014,"Despite negative reviews below (dianapop86) of the blowhole, it is safe and a gr8 attraction for the Nusa Dua beach area. There is a path provided and handrails so there is no danger if you stay on the path. Common sense would tell you this. Of course there will be danger if you are on the rocks when the wave comes in!!! Totally recommended with no element of danger at all "
dianapop86,"Timisoara, Romania",Sep 2014,"In a so overprotected and 5 stars hotel area there is this attraction - Water Blow in Nusa Dua - which is a beautiful, but very dangerous area for which there are not enough and well seen warning signs.There is small bridge built especially for sightseeing, it has some bars to hold on, on its lateral sides, but there is a 2 meters long area at the end of it without bars are anything to hold on. If you are there and a big wave comes, you can easily fall down on the rock reefs.Today, me and my husband fell down on the rocks and we were lucky to get out of it only with scratches. I was lucky to not broke my noise or else. It was a very shocking experience for us, going out of water bleeding and so on... Yes, the Water Blow in Nusa Dua is a wonderful attraction, but it is not safe enough and the authorities or the ones responsible of it should increase the safety measures with more efficient warning signs and also an efficient protection bridge if they built a bridge for sightseeing.I am writing this feedback as a warning for others to not get hurt like us and for the autorities to take measures.Thank you!"
slao,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2014,"Visited a month ago and during mornings its high tide with small surf and some sea weeds, at around 3pm onwards, its low tide and one can walk out to more than 200 meters...very quiet beach, well maintained. Stayed along the Ayodya beachfront which is mopre secluded tha Hyatt's and right in the middle of a very long cove...Beachfront is more than 10 kilometers long where one can hav a leisurely walk or jog. A very nice sunset view. So nice, I stayed 3 days along the beachfront area without leaving. (even having lunch on beachfront.)"
Dr Haider B,"Manama, Bahrain",Sep 2014,"Good for swimming little wave in the morning then low tide ,and lot of secretly .close to bar,I didn't see water sport "
Michael P,"Glynde, Australia",Sep 2014,"The Beach at Nusa Dua is clear and beautiful.  Resorts are dotted along the beach, along with some local cheap massage places and shops.  The waters are calm in the protected bay and there are lots of fish to be seen swimming around."
Cruise H,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"The above two were the worst, but it was to go to the beach and then go swim in the hotel pools, and then spend $70 for lunch with soft drinks at $7 each....."
Rony0011,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Aug 2014,Wonderful area for every travelers. Nothing to dislike. For family with young children this is the perfect place to stay.
Somya S,"Noida, India",Aug 2014,"very calm, shallow beach with clear water, perfect for swimming and a great escape with kids as its v shallow. also the beach is very well maintained, nobody bugs you, fewer people on the beach. Recommend to go to beach from Grand Hyatt resort side (if you don't want to do water sports), there is public area there, very beauiful beach setting with restaurants overlooking the beach."
michML,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,"located in stretch of highly protected luxury hotel area. Touters around but very safe. Clear waters, but beach i will not say is very very clean and soft sand. but it's good enough for a great relaxed beach holiday."
Kimberly J J,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,Every thing about this hotel was great AAA rating will stay again in the near future Palace Club  is worth staying in.
Abhi0911,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,"Beautiful shallow beach, clean crystal clear water. Well maintained. We spent like a whole day in here. Not too many visitors hence you have some privacy as well."
Kasia_Slig,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Aug 2014,"For those who would like to escape from tourists - Nusa Dua beach is perfect. Water cleanliness depends on the level, in the evenings there is outflow and water becomes much more clear. For those who would like to dive, snorkel or go to turtle island - it's perfect choice."
Kel P,Aus,Sep 2014,"Easy to swim, no rubbish anywhere, no one hassling you to buy anything. Perfect for families. This beach is very calm"
les f,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2014,"We stayed in a hotel with a private area of the beach, which was quite good, however out side the private areas are not so well looked after,  we walked in the mornings as their is a walking path most of the way along the front,  which is fabulous,  and there is no one trying to sell you something. Good beach but you can't beat the Qld coast beaches- sorry."
pradeep k,17 contributions,Jul 2014,"This is a very good beach, especially for water sports...This beach has lot of water sports options...one can choose a provider based on budget and beach maintenance."
JARH08,London,Aug 2014,"This is an amazing sandy beach.  The waters are crystal clear, the sands are clean and well maintained with seaweed being swept away daily. The majority of this stretch of beach belongs to the 4/5 star hotels located on the beachfront.The beaches can get crowded in the day in peak seasons.  There is a public walkway running the length of the beach which is lovely to walk along before the sunsets.Shallow waters so ideal for those with children.Probably one of the best beaches in Bali!"
MarkTWN,"Taipei, Taiwan",Aug 2014,very laid back and lots of nice resorts.  food selections aren't too many but you can just eat at your hotel and enjoy the beach
Rizky M,3 contributions,Aug 2014,"Clean beach and not too crowded. i havent found a thing that i did not like about this beach, maybe the limited acces to the beach because the location are in limited complex"
AdelaideTraveller888,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2013,"Our resort had direct access to Nusa Dua beach, so we enjoyed many long walks along the beach. Get up very early for the sunrises, something very special and they are free!  There are no hawkers allowed on the beach, so you really can lay down on a towel and relax for the day. There are some stalls along the boardwalk, as well as places to have a beachside massage or to drop your laundry off to be washed. The sellers are not pushy and are much more respectful of tourists than other parts of Bali. Our resort package included watersports, so we enjoyed the sea-walk, banana boat rides, jet skiing, all close to the resort. We also rode bikes along the boardwalk. Very peaceful and relaxing."
Jade1903,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2014,"Great beach, lovely cool breeze to keep you comfortable, and really nice loungers to lay back and relax on.  Also lovely ocean walk to a really impressive park and Bali Connection where the shops are located and also free shuttles to hotels."
Nick,"Guildford, United Kingdom",Aug 2014,Nusa Dua beach is an absolute paradise.. Lots of water sports available and also nice and quiet if you want it to be! Great sand and water!
Renee M,"Covington, LA",Aug 2014,"What I liked about Nusa Dua is that the beaches there are more private and are not packed with people and hawkers.  We spent the entire day there and really enjoyed it.  There was some trash on the beach, but that's pretty common for Bali.  Overall, it's a really good place to just lay on the beach and relax."
GregFlies,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,You can stroll along the beaches as they are all private resort beaches without people trying to sell you stuff.
HappyTraveller4350,"Toowoomba, Australia",Aug 2014,A long beach with many many hotels ...soft sand lets you have a great workout while walking if you decide not to the the lovely path past all the hotels.  Only 2 tides each day...so low tide leaves the beach without any water....but you can walk out onto the rocks and find a tropical fish or two swimming in the pools.
Julius C,"Lausanne, Switzerland",May 2014,If You leave hotel area beaches are dirty and wild. If You stay in resort You will notice that most of people use swimming pool instead of swimming in the sea.
generalhubub,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Nice sandy beach, water clear but plenty of seaweed once you are 10-20 metres out. Novotel's area has lots of sun beds and dinner in the evening was great with a four piece band who inter-acted well with guests "
PUNIT22,"Jaipur, India",Aug 2014,"Clean and calm, not crowded at all. Some adventure activities as well. There are few activities like snorkeling, surfing, sea walking conducted in day time. There also is a big statue of Shiva at beach."
Kaveri H,"Guwahati, India",Aug 2014,"We were taken to Nusa Dua by our travel agent Pacto travels for water sports. But as we were late in the afternoon,  we decided to go for sea walking only. For a person who didn't know swimming and had never stepped into a pool earlier, the idea was very scary.  However,  seeing the confidence of the agent and diver, I agreed to go ahead. I did panic while going down but our diver Andrew was always there who guided me from going down the ladder and holding on to the railing before settling down for the 20 minute walk. The experience I got, I shall never forget. It was awesome. And specially made comfortable by the diver and his team. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My best Bali moment..."
Janine H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"We stayed in Seminyak, but did a day trip to Nusa Dua to see what the fuss is all about.  I expected to see a better and clearer beach.  It was nicer, but wouldn't go overboard about it.  If you want nice beaches, go to Thailand or Fiji.  Very big hotel resorts and would be lovely to stay for some absolutely R & R.  However, you'd have to eat at the hotels and that would raise the bill enormously."
Muzie,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2014,"There are a lot of hard particles on the beach which we reckon are dead broken corals. Therefore, please do not be bare footed to prevent from getting cut."
Ninja_Cats,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,"The beach here is very lovely, clean and i found you're less likely to get harassed compared to dare i say it, Kuta beach.I found that if you go to a hotel with the beach front you have more privacy as well as less people wondering about. Which was great as well as the beach is very close to hotels. Like you can wake up leave your hotel room and walk out into the ocean in about 100 feet which for me was awesome."
Susan K,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Jet Skis, Parasailing, Flying Fish, Banana Boat....all fantastic fun, had many many great laughs. Staff were great!!"
200KEAM,"Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2014,Biggest rip off at Nusa Dua was a so called charter boat to feed fish and see the reef through a glass bottom boat and then visit Turtle Island.  Don't do it - it cost over $120US and it is a big con.  Turtle Island is not as advertised. It is a small farm (not on an island) with some turtles and other animals - where they try and fleece you for more $.  IT IS NOT A CONSERVATION CENTRE.
Deb C,"Port Kennedy, Australia",Aug 2014,"Loved the settings for a meal, delicious and romantic, we watched the waves crash into the shore while listening to the music and waves"
aurora905,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2014,"We went there in month of march so it was very hot. Walking on beach was also tough as sand had heated up so much. Water activities are average with lack of safety and clean and equipments , specially for sea walk."
Ellie H,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2014,The beach at Nusa Dua that the Marriott hotel uses is beautiful and clean. Nice sun loungers and table service for food and drinks. The only downside is you can't swim as it is so rocky and very painful for the long walk to get out to deep enough water to swim. The beach is sandy just rocky in the sea.
regulartraveller01,"Aylesbury, UK",Sep 2013,"Nusa Dua is a beautiful beach - long wide stretch of golden sand. The water is crystal clear near the beach and gradients to pale turquoise then blue as it goes out deep.  Calm waters ideal for families - the water is shallow for quite a way so not ideal if you are an avid swimmer. The beach was spotless. I didn't see any jellyfish in two weeks but apparently like any other exotic waters, there may be some about. It is so relaxing to just sit and admire the stunning view."
Trish C,"Ocean Shores, Australia",Jun 2014,Beach itself is good and the service great just weather wise unpredictable as the kids were hoping to snorkel
Tom L L,"London, UK",Aug 2014,"Once you get over the gritty shoreline, the sand is soft underfoot. The currents are very gentle and the water shallow so ideal for swimming."
neilsa,"Spring Park, MN",Aug 2014,"Much of the time tide is low, so can not swin. No waves as they break well off shore at the reef. Maybe people don't swim here because the jellyfish signs scare them?? Sand is not White.. not sure why everyone;'s review says this bui there is nowhere on Bali with White sand it is grainy yellow. If you want White go to Philippines :)"
Tessa B,"Thalang District, Thailand",Aug 2014,It is nice. I wouldn't travel an hour or two to see it but if you are staying in Nusa dua definitely worth checking it out :)
Luana B,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,Calm and shadow waters. Nice for kids and relaxing time. I wouldn't recommend it if are planning to swim - too shadow for it. Nusa Dua is also a beautiful place. There are no sunset in this part of the island.
Len D,"Miranda, Australia",Jun 2014,"Nusa Dua is a must GO, it is clean , safe very protected so you will not be blown up as they really look after you while you are staying there as safety is a priority for them.The grounds are spotless, and it is beautiful of a night with all the lighting and it's so nice to walk along the beach front on a safe and secure pathway is a must as so many of Balis paths are unsafe.NusaDua is a lovely Bali experience."
1138WVerhoeven,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2013,"visit this place for so many time, can't say much, only one thing,, from the first time till now, I still love this place!"
Bishy,"Eastleigh, UK",Aug 2014,Pretty looking but a big undertow whilst in the water. Rats at the eastern end of the beach big enough to bbq. Rock pools inaccessible to youngsters.
shmapa,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2014,Great for windsurfing off club med . Interesting and photogenic. I loved siting on the beach with a glass of wine and just gazing at the sea.
ria080,"Noida, India",Jul 2014,"One of the most attractive beach in Bali, crystal clear blue water and white sands makes you never leave this place.A must visit if you are a beach lover. Perfect for swimming as well.There is this adjacent restaurant (forgot the name) where they serve amazing sea food. You can enjoy the ocean view as you gulp some great tasting fish from your plate."
Sue W,"Woollahra, Australia",Jul 2014,Clean water. Security patrol so you didn't get hassled.One end has all the water activities so wouldn't like to be in a hotel nearby
Angellen_10,"Mandurah, Australia",Jul 2014,"Although the beach was great to visit it was not good for swimming, while we were there in July 2014, too much rubbish in the ocean."
LarsVaaland,"Stabekk, Norway",Jul 2014,Very shallow beach with a reef outside and a lot of seagrass in between. Not really good for swimming.
SabriMarc,"Calgary, Canada",Jul 2014,Beautiful long beach with a nice Beach walk overlooking all the gorgeous resorts on one side and the Ocean on the other. Do not stop to talk to the hawkers. They are quite annoying.
adelaidegrega,"Richmond, Australia",Aug 2013,Great beach great views great paths along the  resorts great sand the water and rubbish in it was a picture from HELL.  Got back to oz and the people here could not believe photos.
Carolina M,12 contributions,Jul 2014,"I don't surf so I was really looking for a nice and sandy beach in the area (not so many) and this is definitely the paradise beach. Nice and clear water, sandy (no rocks) and it has trees for those who don't like sun. It can get a little windy some days, but even so it's the best beach in Bali."
lisamm83,"Manila, Philippines",Jul 2014,Beautiful strip of beach with a long walking track that goes right along the beach in front of all the resorts. Great for walking or cycling. A few look out points. Lovely white sand and good swimming spots for small children.
Marie R,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"The water was polluted with plastic bags. We stayed at our  Hotel's Beach club which was very enjoyable, but the beach pollution caused by Bali general rubbish, did not encourage us to swim a great deal at the beach."
riy2000,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2013,so nice and clean beach with some activates for everybody.. it's nice to walk around with many hotels beside it.
Ang S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2014,"White sands, beautiful water.  We liked lazing on the sunbeds.  Take the sun cream as the sunburn is hotttt.. Watch out for the windburn too."
SpiceandNectar,Australia,Jul 2014,Pity about the constant jet skis and motor boats ruining the tranquility and beauty of this environment. A lovely reef ruined by man made entertainment. A lot more revenue could be raised from respecting and caring for the reef with snorkling and nature based activities.
DalikaB,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2014,"Clean beach, the water is lovely and not many waves so you can swim. The only annoying part is the people with their jet skis and motor boats, it can get a bit loud and smelly with the fumes sometimes."
rudy_setiawan,"Batam Center, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"Visited this beach due to the location near to the place we stay. There are quite a number of hotels in the vicinity of the beach, many water sports activities here (jet ski, parasiling, canoing, etc). Just a short visit is fine."
Ibadanboy,"Nairobi, Kenya",Jul 2014,"Nusa Dua beach is a gem. Compared to the hustle & bustle you find at the busy beaches of Kuta, Legian etc, Nusa Dua is a calm oasis of peace & comfort. Fine white sand, a nice long & curving bay to the beach, never crowded (there is a security barrier to the entrance) and with a lot fewer sales people at hand. The water is calm, no surfing waves here, blue and warm most of the year. The bottom of the sea along the beach is rocky, so tread with care - or wear appropriate water shoes. Swimming is possible when the tide is right and you can get a couple of hours of warm, calm swimming in this delightful place. The beach itself is very long and you can go for romantic walks for at least a couple of kilometres. There are many 5* hotels along the beach, but they are recessed quite a distance away, so not intrusive at all. You can get a 1hour massage under cabanas for really cheap prices compared to the hotels & spas - make sure you treat yourself to one - you'll come back for more everyday! A quiet and lovely beach - one of my favourites on the island. Most highly recommended!"
WeRtheTravelers,"Kailua-Kona, HI",Jul 2014,Nice sand but the huge reef prevents waves. People can walk a long ways out and still be in shallow water.
szkut,"Kincumber, Australia",Jul 2014,"Staying in Kuta we came down here on our bikes. Upon entry just say you are having lunch at one of the resorts. Then park at one and feel free to use whichever beach. Very upmarket area similar to Denarau in Fiji but a much nicer beach area.It is a little more to stay here, but for a family or romantic couple it is what I would say as one of the better options in Bali. Depends on your taste but definitely will stay here next time."
BJcyclist,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2014,"Clean beach and very few hustlers...but do take a $10 1hr massage. We hired jet skis for 30mins, and parasailed. Good surf at a break called Sri Lanka."
harrynheather,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2014,"We stayed at the Melia Bali Resort and used both their pools and amazing private golden sand beach. When the tide is somewhere between an hour either side of full, it is amazing and great for decent swimming. It is foremost though, very very safe. Very little tide movement or current.When the tide is out, is goes out for a long time and a long way, about 600 - 700 mtrs. Overall, a magical place to stay and enjoy all there is to offer."
BulliedbyChangi,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2014,"Coming from the madness of Kuta, where most of the time you are better of walking, as we found one night when we wanted to go to Poppies 1 from the Discovery Kartika Plaza although we could have walked my daughter which has trouble walking so we diced to get a taxi and where told once in the taxi he won't take us so we gave up on that Idea.Nusa Dua is much more lay back , clean, a better section of restaurants a free shuttle running to most Hotels to the shopping centre.If I was to pick where to stay in Bali again It would be Legian, Sanur, Nusa Dua saying all that It depends on your budget , but its that old saying you only get what you pay for.love Nusa Dua If your after a relaxing holiday by the pool or beach then this is the place for you.RegardschangiarportJames"
SofiaC c,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2014,"hard to find, took us a few tries at looking for it- once you get there it is beautiful. we came on high tide and had a swim, when the tide went out we went out and looked at all the sea life such as sea snakes, sea urchins, sea weed, crabs, and much more "
Sarah W,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2014,"Steep beach but few big waves due to the outer reef. Wide bay, so space for everyone. Hawkers are allowed but not many like in Kuta. Lovely to stroll along at any time of the day; it's on the eastern edge so lovely sunrises. But there are also plenty of trees giving shade during the day, and at night the hotels have lights in them that swing in the gentle breezes"
jainprakhar,"Hyderabad, India",Jul 2014,This beach is located close to the hotels in Nusa Dua and offers white sand. The waves are calm  and the water clean. Not much crowd here. The beach is frequented by the guests of the hotels nearby.
Marcella,"Louisville, Kentucky, United States",Jul 2014,"Mengiat is a part of Nusa Dua beach. This section is near the Grand Hyatt Resort and it was absolutely my favorite beach I visited while in Bali. The water was clear, closest thing to white sand, and there was the least amount of seaweed and trash in this area. Loved it!"
marshallls28,"Alderley Edge, UK",Aug 2013,Lovely place but not the real Bali.  The whole time we were there we were desperate to get out and see the real Bali.  It was our honeymoon so we did go for extra special but that came with security and a peninsular which was manicured within an inch of its life. In hindsight it would never have been something for us as we prefer the real deal.
56RDG,"West Sussex, UK",Jun 2014,"A beautiful sandy beach and because of the reef, safe for swimming. There are boat trips and watersports available."
Applecrumbz,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2014,"The actual Westin Hotel beach front of Nusa Dua was nice and sandy as expected but the sea water was cold but still swimmable for me (Not many others would try and those that do, do not stay in long). Late afternoon time the water goes way out and it doesn't look nice. Late morning onwards when the sun comes out and water is still close is the best time to come here."
1Robbie1969,"Oldham, UK",Oct 2013,"Nusa Dua is a popular balinese destination, the beach is central to most hotels in Nusa. The beach itself is nice and long. The beach has all the usual activities, parasailing, volleyball, jet skis, wake boarding etc. My key advice is all the locals are friendly and offer additional trips, you can run a boat down to the turtle sanctuary hired straight from the beach or hire it for the day but as with the watch sellers or sarong salesman there are two prices on the beach, the tourist price and a real price always haggle its fun. In October, the beach comes alive for a week with all the local villagers arriving at the temple grounds to celebrate Diwali a hindu festival, the temple grounds are alive with culture culmanating in two or three colourful and musical nights of religious celebrations. Diwali is a must experience and dependant on your willingness to engage with the locals you will be allowed in the temple as long as you observe hindu customs."
Nikesh Vasa,"Jamnagar, India",Jun 2014,"The beach is nice with blue waters, but it is not good for swimming and just going around as it is a rocky beach and not smooth."
Iamagnes,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Dec 2013,"this was at our hotel, so easily accessible. So we did spend a lot of time on the beach. some vendors try to sell you stuff, but negotiate hard."
KaruTA,"Jurong, Singapore",Jun 2014,Nice clear water with moderate waves. Suitable for swimming & wading. Plenty of shades provided by trees with shower facilities nearby. 
Rahul G,"Candolim, India",Apr 2014,Nusa Dua is probably one of the few beaches where you can swim without any surfers around. They have all Hotels lined up on the beach. Few normal places to eat n drink but u will have to walk a lot depending which property you are staying at. The massage on the beach is good n cheap. Watersports are plenty but be careful as they dont have the best safety gear or life guards. We had a very bad experience with watersports on Nusa Dua Beach.
Erfp79,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"The beach was only okay.  Water was calm, protected by a breakwater.  But sand was a bit coarse, and there were pieces of trash floating in the ocean:(.  Water was pleasant, but very shallow at low tide, and there was lots of vegetation.  There were NO warnings about the presence of sea urchins at our hotel beach (I saw very small ones posted up-beach at other resorts after) and my foot grazed one, getting two spines in the ball of my foot as I swam.  It was extremely painful, and necessitated a trip to the local hospital.  The hospital, by the way, was LOVELY,  and the medical care there excellent (four stars to them!)."
Diane266,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,"This beach is very nice with less crowd, and clean too. We went there for our honeymoon. It is also very quiet."
Aychen S,67 contributions,Jun 2014,"White sands and quiet place to spend private time with family. At June the rocks were sharp, had to be careful with kids."
ana,"Athens, Greece",May 2014,"Very nice walking around. The water is warm but sometimes the currents are very strong, so you can not swim. It was clean and not crowded."
ChefLeongL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2013,"Nusa dua area best part is safety and lots of branded hotel and resort, nusa dua beach area is suitable surfing, so does expect fine white sand beach...forget it this area."
mrsjeanday,lichfield,May 2014,Fantastic clean soft sand beach and warm sea. Excellent  resort spotlessly clean.Everyone spoke perfect English and very polite.
David F,"London, UK",Jul 2014,"This beach is beautiful, clean and quiet. But remember that all beaches are accessible in Bali, so there is no need to limit yourself to so-called ""public"" beaches."
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,"Nusa Dua is a resort area with 5 star hotels, restaurants and shopping center.  The beach at Nusa Dua is lovely - fine white sand beaches and most of the 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua have their own stretch of nice beach.Nusa Dua is a little further away from the town area or Kuta. So you will need to hire a car or taxi if you need to go out."

ReginaldSLin,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Beautiful quiet beach, white sand, with a width of at least 20 meters at high tide, and much more when the tide goes down.  The breaking waves offshore are wonderful to watch.  I am not a surfer, but I figure surfers would have quite an enjoyable time.Closer to shore are smaller breaks, which are good enough for body surfing.The beach is peaceful.  Just pull up a sun chair, find a shady spot, and doze off hearing the natural sounds of wave pounding.Of course there are some peddlars about, but they are generally unobtrusive and not pushy.  They mainly leave you alone until you call them over."
Scott M,"Oslo, Oslo, Norway",Jun 2014,"I traveled alot trough Bali, and this beach is just like many of them. With that said, it's a very nice beach. But nothing out of the ordinary."
skakar60,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2014,"Nusa Dua is a beach  alongside which there are many luxury hotels, side by side, so you see a multitude of beach chairs and umbrellas all along. However, when we went, they were mostly unoccupied and there were very few people on the beach. So we had a liesurely swim in the cordoned off swimming areas in the sea. It is a beautiful beach with clear water and white sands, vey calm and serene!"
alan_vitali,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,Maybe it is a nice beach but the days we were there the wind was up and the waves were a bit too big for small kids
Shiping,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Very nice beach i must say. It's not too crowded (which is very good) and it's quite pretty! Even though the sand wasn't the very soft type and the water is not very clean towards the shore (but it's very blue and it's quite clear), it's still very enjoyable sitting there enjoying the sun and the wind!"
Lu1113,"London, UK",Jun 2014,"Don't go... terrible vibe...could be anywhere.  despite the nice scenery, its a poor man's Disneyland and a definite miss.  Also, note all the beach hotels are set in so I would be surprised if the accommodation views are anything to write home about."
Dennis D,"Bunbury, Australia",Mar 2014,"Nusa Dua beach is nice and all beach-facing hotels do their bit to keep the areas tidy BUT...the path along the beach seems to be non-existent in parts. Other than that, quite a pleasant walk for tourists. "
mwen97,Singapore,May 2014,Beautiful and private beach. Sand was not white but the waters were clear and blue.There weren't many people milling around and beach chairs widely spaced out. 
Colin B,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2013,"Clean, uncrowded and patrolled for privacy and security. Drinks, meals and snacks served on the beach at your own chair/daybed."
VibrantAurora,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Nusa Dua is more a chillax and private beach for families and couples. If you have energetic teens who love more vibrant activities, go to Kuta/Seminyak area. We did not like the latter as it was TOO congested for our enjoyment. To compromise, we had water sports at Tanjung Benoa - just 10 mins away from Nusa Dua. "
Aruniya,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2014,"We stayed in Sanur, but ended up here without planning it when we visited the mall. The beach is one the most beautiful beaches I have seen in Bali (I did not go to north). I believe it can be a bit dangerous in high tide but otherwise it is also great for a swim. The view is great. There are a lot of hang outs along the beach, where you can relax. I agree with other visitors that they can maintain it a bit more clean."
Mukul K,navi mumbai,May 2014,If you want to have a relaxing beach vacation then NUSA Dua is the place to go. Very clean and not crowed at all
Steven D,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Highly manicured and very clean, beach sellers not as pushy as Kuta. Great swimming pools and plenty of bars in all the hotels, beers slightly pricey."
xxPeteandLinda,"Sutherland Shire, Australia",May 2014,We had dead birds floating in the water & was told they have to remain for religious purposes. The Rip & Current was extremely dangerous. Watch your children closely. 
Franquete,"Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina",Mar 2014,"Very nice, friendly and family beach with a nice view to the volcano.  Best Hotel in the Area, Melia."
AmeliaJayne,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"Long beach, great for walks and calm enough to swim. When the tides out the water is quite a walk away."
Sook Ling T,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,Great sight! A must visit place if u are at nusa dua. The experience is like watching the firework for the first time in disney land. The only different is that... this is a natural water blow. I just love this place.
Jean-Paul R,"Shenyang, China",May 2014,We were at the Club Med the beach lucky for us was clean 3 time per day by the Club Med staff but if you walk along the beach of Nusa Dua is was full of rubbish it was a sad view. 
sandraubillus,"Key Biscayne, FL",May 2014,I stayed in the Westin...Everything was first class... and I was able to play tennis everyday..Dany is a great teacher.
coutts44,"Rowville, Australia",May 2014,"Current can get a little strong, so just keep an eye out for the kids. This beach is really quite and relaxing. As the resorts have their own private beach, towels and food and drinks are always available as is beach lounges and umbrellas"
Guntur R,"Kuta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"Yeah, i love it.There are several beach in Nusa Dua. I know Padang-padang, dreamland, suluban beach, pandawa beach. I am falling love to Suluban beach with blue ocean with cliff, also good for surfing."
NPRW2210,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"calm, clean, blue water.. all i can say Nusa Dua Beach is an ideal beach for relaxing and swimming.. it was quite and hot but the view is really nice and you would to enjoy it so much there.. there are some massive resort around Nusa Dua Beach but that will be ok to soak up the sun!"
NeeNee_Cho,Penang,May 2014,"We did a morning cycling ride along the beach till the Nusa Dua Hope garden. There were lots to explore along the beach, beautiful photo shooting spots, local candi, hotel deco and the nice garden towards the end of the cycling path."
Sir WS,"Kajang, Malaysia",May 2014,"Nothing spectacular, but I guess some people like it quieter than a crowded beach like Kuta. The best spots are owned by hotels/resorts and the section with public access is nothing to shout about. It lacks shades from the scorching hot sun other than the chargeable loungers. It's not a place that I would regret not visiting.Generally a quiet and clean beach, suitable for early mornings or around sunsets."
pan k,"Famagusta, Cyprus",Jan 2014,"maybe the best beach in bali ( clean) very quiet not much to do.good for 4,5 days maybe all the beach have big hotels that have there omprelas and sunbed on the  beach"
Christine D,"Preston, UK",May 2014,Liked everything about the place except for the 2 sea snakes which we saw. The beach was cleaned everyday and there were plenty of loungers to relax on.
Carmel D,3 contributions,May 2014,The beach was very inviting.  It is cleaned every day but we walked along it one day whilst the sea was at high tide and quite a lot pollution was being washed up.  Coming from Australia we decided to make more use of the hotel pools rather than the beach.
Jacintha N,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2014,"I went there in the evening and the sunset was lovely. Unlike the Kuta beach, the Nusa Dua beach is a lot smaller and quieter. There are no surfers or much activities happening there. Great for a peaceful chill out evening. "
JanetM075,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2014,Nowhere to sit. Sharp shells and coral. Not very clean. Not many good swimming areas. We only went there once and avoided this beach.
ginarti,Jakarta,Jun 2013,"We went to water blow, it was located in a very nice and well maintained environment. A very nice place to visit in the afternoon and enjoy the sunset.  "
mochacoffee44,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,Close to the bali collection and beachside restaurants.nice and breezy in the shade while you enjoy a meal. Has a pool for the kids aswell as lounge chairs and tables on the sand.
Yen A,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2014,"I had made a booking with my driver before i went there so the price was cheaper and fixed. Otherwise they will charged u in USD. The beachboys was very friendly and helpful. The most annyoying thing was those lady who force you to buy souvenier from them. Dont ask them if you dont want to buy,or else they will follow you anywhere."
bonjourajat,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2013,"the watersports are very good and are performed middle of sea giving you a thrilling experience.I really liked gold fish which takes u up in the sir lying on a bedlike surface and then suddenly put you down of sea surface. I didnt like banana boat as those drivers are not trustworthy and will turn the boat down in the water in spite of your request to them. Though , they keep u safe and do it to give u thrilling fun"
Pat P,"Helensvale, Australia",Jan 2014,very relaxing because the hawkers aren't allowed there. Only downside was having to get the shuttle from the hotel
Pris,"Riau Province, Indonesia",Dec 2013,"Strolling around the museum, the peace park, and wait for the big water splash. The rows of ""duwet"" trees give a tangy flavour to taste when in its seasons.  "
Malcolm C,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2014,"Swimming at the beach was like swimming in a hot bath.  The beach was generally clean, with little visible rubbish."
ccsclwns7773,"Tiverton, UK",Apr 2014,"This is a beach away from the rough surf and rip tides of Legian and Kuta and is safer for swimming. There are less people on this beach than legian and thus many less sellers harassing you for massages or knick-knacks you dont really want.I was able to hire two sunbeds and a umbrella for 50000 Indonesia ruppea (about £3.30) and enjoy the calm waters and golden sand, although i did have to pay for the taxi ride which was 500000 ruppea (£25) , it was still worth it not to be thrown about by the big waves and currents on the Legian side of the coast."
amin a,25 contributions,Apr 2014,"the beach was clean and quite you can relax and enjoy the beach without any crowd, if you with a kids i think it was a perfect beach to play "
mschmidt83,"Martha's Vineyard, MA",Apr 2014,"Water was perfect temp and clean watch out for the coral under foot though ! ..  nice to body surf some good waves ... the beach itself is very nice, clean with beautiful sand..  a beautiful beach all up"
Frankascanbe,"Dublin, Ireland",Apr 2014,Small waves so great for young kids but as with all of Bali's beeches the water is populated by plastic rubbish although this beech seemed to have the least. The sand here is clean as the hotels have it raked over every day.
Laura S,"Doreen, Victoria, Australia",Mar 2014,Beautiful & clean in comparison to kuta. No black sand that's to hot to walk on. You also do not get harassed as much. 
Kelvin K,"Markham, Canada",Mar 2014,"Being a private beach, Nusa Dua Beach is definitely the cleanest in Bali. There are people constantly raking the sand and taking out any floating garbage from the Ocean.Very relaxing beach with very few hawkers to bother you."
charisma219,"Lawrence, MA",Mar 2014,"Nusa Dua Beach is just an okay beach. There is a good amount of beach front. The sand is a medium coarseness and brown.  When you step into the water it is also sandy, which is nice to not step on rocks or corals.  The water is warm and calm.  There are not a lot of waves. At low tide, the water completely disappears and is pulled back several hundred feet which occurred every afternoon during our stay.  It is not a beach that you can snorkel either.  It is nice beach to swim and do water sports such as kayaking or paddleboating."
DC44th,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2014,"Absolutely gorgeous beaches and nice town with a small ""Bali Connection"" center full of restaurants and shops. Perfect for a quiet family holiday."
Marc M,"Charlotte, NC",Oct 2013,"Like most beaches in Indonesia, there is nice scenery, but once you get up close, you see a lot of trash. The resorts on the beach are incredible, and the bike path is a nice idea, BUT it is not continuous, so there are times you have to walk the bike through the sand or else up / down steps."
Nachiket S,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2014,"The Nusa Dua is ideally for swimming, the tides are gentle, the water is blue, the beach is clean. Some of the beaches are private for the hotels, but it has couple of stretched which are public and accessible easily.  "
Serh I,11 contributions,Feb 2014,"Nice place to swim without big waves, ideal place for swim with babies. It's sand beach with big amount of tourists. You can surfing or kayaking or snorkling or get massage.  "
Caroline S,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2014,"Nice and clean and relatively free of hawkers.  I noticed some with numbered blue shirts, I wonder if these people have to obtain a permit to trade?"
WorldGlutton,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2014,"From the Nugurah Rai International Airport, is a 15 mins drive through the Toll with RP10000 to Nusa Dua Beach.The atmosphere at Nusa Dua Beach with its beauty , safety & comfort complement by  not only star rated hotels but facilities ranges from sports, recreations , culture and shopping center as well as convention centre , make it a prime venue alternative for all International Events. Staying here for Conference in the Resort Hotel,  I am fascinated by the fresh & beautiful tropical environment , the high level of security, the warm hospitality and its balinese traditional culture & activities  along this beach .Nusa Dua beach has a long white sand beach, beautiful flora & fauna, & a magnificient view of sky  over the Indian Ocean.  From the tourists to the local visitors that i came across at this Beach, between society & natural environment..its truly a place of  Peace, Love & Beauty !!!!"
Suzi W,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,"Likes: Very clean, calm, beach hawkers all registered and controlled so not so annoying, southern end is a bay and appears safe for children, good security"
kuota,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2014,"It has been 20 years since we have been here and obviously there has been some development! Of course we remember just how relatively expensive it was back then and there was nothing else here except a few resorts in the middle of nowhere. But now its a thriving hub of most other of the things you would find at Kuta and Sanur. The good news is that massages are actually cheaper here than in Kuta! The beach is very very good for Bali (being a volcanic island) with gorgeous warm waters and very calm for kids to enjoy. The water sports do not hamper the swimming much we found unless you wanted to do some long distance open water swimming, but its perfect for kids and young families."
Ketut Gde P,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2014,"Since years this beach is always a stunning white sandy beach for sun rice between two peninsula called ""Nusa Dua"" (Two Small Island). Now days this place is one of the world famous beach for tourist from allover the world. Along the beach I found many happiness tourist whom enjoyed the sun, laying on the grass and sand, as most of the five star resort is located in this area. Having chat with local vendor to over a souvenir and traditional massage on the beach with only 50-100K for an hour treatment. Sun rise at 06:15 am from the Jetty looks fantastic. Beach is clean and free from the hassle, local vendor will not disturb while we enjoyed our time at the resort."
Cathy L,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2014,Hotels in nusa  dua has all the security and serenity of a gated community ( which it really is not) beach beautiful in the usual Balinese style but very clean and hassle free unlike the beaches in Kuta or Jimbaren. 
sinner5,"White Rock, Canada",Mar 2014,"As opposed to other beaches in Bali, this one is meticulously cleaned by the resorts.  This is a beach for the early risers as the sun rises over the horizon here since it's located on the east part of the peninsula.The water is shallow and sheltered... It is safe for children and weak swimmers.This is a beach for families and those looking for minimal hassles... even if it is a little ""sterile""..."
Amanda R,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2014,"Locals can only sell their wears on the beach, they can not go on the other side of the footpath into resorts. So if not wanting to be annoyed stay on the resort side of the path"
Cat_MM,"Kempten, Germany",Feb 2014,"Amazing color of water, clean and comfortable to walk. Must see, better on sunrise time. But it's only tourists place, so restaurants are overpriced here."
Mariana_Zhao,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2014,i were have an amazing experience with my friends by visiting here. we are walking to the bridge and have a picture with the wonderful sea. then the most excited part comes. we got wet by the sea water blowing up. hahahaha... it is really amazing experience.... but beware of it ...beside it is an exciting experience.  it is also absolutely as dangerous as buggy jumping. so must be careful when you were at the bridge... i love it... hope you like it too
moss213,musselburgh,Feb 2014,most beautiful spot with quite stunning views out across the bay.especially atmospheric at sunset and dawn.

Jane Dowling,"Geelong, Australia",Dec 2013,Crystal clear waters and clean sandy beach area.  Was. Over to swim in the ocean than in the pools of the hotel
everythingineed,"Calgary, Canada",Jan 2014,"so beautiful and so clean, the pedlars didn't bother you if you said no, a quick walk along the beach to a great mall with great restaurants"
Sean_Lam,"Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam",Oct 2013,"A long stretch of clean, quite and beautiful beach open exclusively to guests at the many 5 star resorts in the area. The upside is that the beach is safe, clean and manned by security guards round-the-clock. Also you will never never go hungry or thirty because of the ample (albeit over-priced) restaurant and bar options around. What's missing is however the local Balinese flavour. You will hardly see any locals in this area. My advice to all fellow travellers - there is no shame enjoying the comfort of this sterile world, but remember also try exploring other areas on the island to experience the real Bali."
Chailey_Paul,"North Chailey, UK",Feb 2014,"The beach even looks man made. Security guards every few metres is unsettling. Row up row of beach beds, change of colour or style tells you that you are the next hotel. No real people."
Yeliz A,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2014,"I came in February which is the low season of tourist in Bali. It was actually great although it did not have sunshine all the time (but sometimes pretty strong sunshine), I feel pretty comfortable to swim at that time. The beautiful blue water made me feel like I'm dreaming :) I miss the beach there~ "
AlexTRJ,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Feb 2014,"Most part of Nusa Dua beach is actually not open to the public, its only reserved for the guests of the numerous 5 stars hotels in that area. However there are 2 stretches that are accessible by public so if you are not staying in one of the hotels in Nusa Dua but you want to check out the beach, ask your driver to bring you there.Both stretches of beach are beautiful, quiet and clean. The left side beach are mostly filled with huts, beach chairs whereas the right side beach is mostly empty.When you walk towards the right side beach, behind the beach are the cool drink bars and huts for you to grab your drink.This area is perfect if you just want to get some suntan peacefully, or chill out on the beach with some drinks or a book. Definitely hundred times better than Kuta beach. If you are in Bali, don't miss out on Nusa Dua beach."
nunomgomes,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2014,Went to the beach a couple of times and was OK. I felt like I was in soup as it was nice and warm. There was hardly anyone at the beach so I had a bit of piece and quiet.

spdang,"Phuket, Thailand",Feb 2014,"Well it is quite because Nusa Dua is kind of an isolated area for holiday resorts surrounded by gates with guards. It might sound negative at first but in fact going to the beach with nobody there to harass you trying to sell something to you can be quite nice too. As for the beach itself, not fantastic, clean but not so beautiful as compared to Thailand or even Vietnam. We visited more beautiful beaches in Asia. "
Tarja79,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Feb 2014,"beach was great on site massage,drinks and food right on your lounger we enjoyed ice cold bintang but would not op for the massage the ladies didn't look great mid age on wards  "
AJ9889,"Palangkaraya, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"I love the beach, it's beautiful because there's a private beach area which is connected to hotels, and the public area. In public beach area, we can find many souvenirs sold by locals, many traditional foods & snacks which is cheap. But nothing we can do more than just walking around, have a sit, reading books, enjoy the view, swimming or tasting the local foods. While in private beach which is connected to the hotel, it's private, we can do water sport or just go to snorkeling with the boat. then, it's more comfort to sunbathing or just relaxing on the private beach because only hotel guests who can enter it."
LFLLFL,Sydney,Jan 2014,"The beach is amazing.Very warm, very clean.Plenty of places to buy food and drink.And get massages.Definitely worth a visit or 2."
Gracie B,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2014,"Went there with a friend just to have a good time with each other, I really loved this beach, very relaxing and had a great time with my friend."
EbruED,"Istanbul, Turkey",Feb 2014,"Sea was ideal for surfers instead of swimmers, cause it was very shallow, good for kids though. Liked it anyways, sided by a rocky area, where we all enjoyed collecting lots of sea shells.. "
Brian L,"Arlington, Virginia, United States",Feb 2014,"Went during the rainy season (first week in Feb), but the beach was pretty empty and the water was perfect for swimming in (warm and calm waters)."
duvu,"Stockholm, Sweden",Feb 2014,The scenery was wonderful. Felt very relaxing at the beach. However not good for swimming at low tide due to a lot of rocks and seaweed. 
adi035,"Brasov, Romania",Oct 2013,"Beach near the ocean is made up of fine sand and hot. Sunbeds and umbrellas are placed on toward the land, landscaped with grass. Along the beach there are terraces and pools, very well furnished."
ZuZ85,"Beirut, Lebanon",Jan 2014,"Great private beach with clear waters and white sands. Lots of activities to do, make sure that you ask for a lower price."
MMMMG,"Buhl, Germany",Jul 2013,Great beaches are getting uncovered especially in the rocky stretches of the sea shore around noon when the low tide comes. Walking or snorkeling in the shallow reefs enjoys not only children.
JCordovilla,"Malaga, Spain",Feb 2014,"When the tide is high it is safe for the kids.When it is low, they can explore the sands and reefs.It's a perfect place to go with young children."
GilesB71,"Newton Abbot, UK",Mar 2013,fine sand and enough shelter. Good food available and useful guys selling cheap stuff and hair braiding etc
Pija Lalu,"Nan, Thailand",Jan 2014,"Very good with a long walkway along the beach, that also good for biking. Not so many people on the beach when compared with Semiyak or Kuta. "
Wendong-LEE,"Beijing, China",Feb 2014,"compared with Kuta beach, this beach is fabulous. sand is fine, water mild. many water sports. considering the other things' prices here, water sports are expensive. people mostly recommend water motor and jet fish. Here, sand and water are good for children to play. just be careful of the boats coming in and out and, leaving less and less shallow water area for kids."
familycat,kiwi in Melbourne,Apr 2013,"Given that the beach is part of the resort complex, it is kept pristine, with workers regularly patrolling the beach and keeping it postcard perfect. Hawkers are licensed, so although you will be approached to buy a sarong or kite or whatever, there are not many of them, and they are respectful.It's not great to swim at high tide or when the tide is coming in as lots of rubbish gets brought in on the tide. As the tide goes out, the rubbish clears away. The water is beautiful."
648Explorer648,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2013,"If you looking for nice clear blue beach go to Nusa Dua Area  (not in Seminyak, or Legina or Kuta it was a disaster there.)"
G S,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2013,This beach is amazing as it is not too packed which makes it more relaxing and fun.  The beach was clean and we had a great time.  Miss it already.
Lisa M,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",May 2013,"Great beach with white sand , very relaxing with nice tropical gardens. Great for a family. We stayed at Novotel Nusa Dua & they had there own private beach & great resturant . Loved it"
Mandy Q,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2013,"Nothing special about the Nusa Dua beach, overall not particularly impressive. Like Bali's mountain areas more."
Yu Q,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Nov 2013,"I loved the beach so much!!!! coz of the time we went, there weren't many people at all. it was so relaxing and peaceful. "
Piotrowski1969,"Andover, UK",Jan 2014,"We surfed here on many occasions on our visit, there are quite a few beaches here and it does stretch some way.  Lots of bars and cafe's along the way, the beauty of this beach is you can walk along with out being hassled to buy anything..  there are little stalls, and places to get massages on the beach all very reasonebly priced.  very safe place to walk around,"
Henrykoci,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2014,"not so much wave and not too crowded like Kuta and you don't find so much people offering products.Good for Family, no prostitutes hanging around looking for white guys. most of them are those taken from Kuta by single lonely man and since this area has more visitors with family so you don't see that often."
Duwi M,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2014,"Hi everyone,This is my first review on tripadvisor.comFirstly, I do apologize for my bad English.. yaah it's because English is not my mother language but I'll try my best :)Well, do you wanna go to Nusa Dua Beach while in Bali? Then that's a good plan. White sand, low tides, no big waves, perfect for swimming especially for your kids. There are many activities you can do there. Jogging and cycling track, football, beach volleyball, nice fishing spots, surfing, and one amazing attraction called water blow. Just come and see by yourself :)"
Anna M,Moscow,Jan 2014,No big waves and low-tides are not that visible. Long yellow sand beach is also ideal for walking. Great for kids!
MoJ,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2014,"So if you not into the crazy partying and huge crowds this area of Bali would be for you. First up beautiful resorts located in a secluded gated area. I stayed at the Sofitel NUSA DUA. The beach fr me was in a lot better condition than Padang Padang or Dreamland for that matter, This coming from a cleanliness position. great for swimming. If you do feel like getting out to Kuta for some shopping or experiencing the tourist hustle and bustle a cab ride will cost about 20 USD one way. There is an open air mall called Bali collection and most resorts provide free transport but i must warn you that this over priced but has some decent resturants worth trying out. Dont use the massage services theres cause hey a little expensive. If you venture out of the gates you will find a little street shopping area where you can find great bargins and try out Zahras SPA for some RR. She also provides pic up and drop of services for free. All in all i would split my next trip between Seminyak,Nusa Dua and Ubud."
alf0012010,"Houston, TX",Jan 2014,Great beach for couples and families alikePos- not too many people (private hotel beaches)- calmNeg-  coarser sand
Terry M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,At times lots of seaweed and some floating rubbish. Not really pretty but also not a bad beach. Nice to have a rest and a drink in one of the many 5-star hotels located there.
SwissJ70,"Warwick, UK",Jan 2014,Nothing special but cleaner than Kuta and SeminyakNo really choice for a drink at a local bar - dominated by hotels and expensive bar & food prices
Sancher H,"Port Stephens, Australia",Feb 2013,"relaxing, peaceful, great place to be and the locals beach is great also. Clean water, try a lemon squash at The Hyatt for the best thirst quenching drink - they put a fresh lemon grass in each drink."
Carolmm1,"Harare, Zimbabwe",Dec 2013,"pristine beaches,water was very warm and pleasant to spend the day in just catching the waves,they rank second to the maldives in my list"
Joeyboy J,3 contributions,Nov 2013,"paradise of its own, white sand and clear water plus the waves perfect for surfing. 5 star hotels are popular in this area though a bit far from where the action is."
Elizabeth C,"New York City, NY",Dec 2013,"Beach is clean, well maintainted, and water is beautiful.  Much nicer than Seminyak and no hawkers trying to sell you junk! "
c0sm0p0litangirl,indonesia,Feb 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is as lovely as other beaches in Bali. I went to this secret spot, more like private, and it was nice, not too crowded, enjoy the wave!"
paulajab,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2013,"The ONLY beach to travel too during the Rainy season in Bali.  The other beaches we visited were exceptionally dirty.  Nusa Dua resort beach of Marriott Courtyard was very nice.  With service staff, and beach chairs- surf lessons- shopping- etc.  You don't have to leave your chair! "
tumbleweed5,"Columbus, OH",Dec 2013,Very sad that the beaches were not kept up. Must have been a nice beach 15 years ago.  Trash was everywhere and lots of water sports going on.  Looks like accidents could happen easily. 
Chandra A,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2013,"Enjoyed just being in the water. The place is so clean, the walking pathways neat, local people are very friendly. It was just a pleasure. We went to the beach early at 6Am and just lost count of time:)"
Priyanka R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2013,"If you are looking for a clean beach that has no hawkers pestering you to take massages, buy icecream & beads, Nusa Dua is certainly the place.Fell in love with the beach here. Unlike Legion-Kuta, this beach is cleaner. Unlike Balangan, the water is calmer & the sand is finer."
Christine651,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,Whole beach area spotlessly clean and safe.   Toss-up whether to swim in beach or resort pools.   Great walking/cycling track all along beaches in front of resorts.   Lots of eats and drinks available along the way.
Christine C,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,"Unrestricted access along beach walkway, first class accommodation.   Just a wonderful happy atmosphere and awesome beach.  Lots of things to do in area."
Ulissethetraveller,"Rome, Italy",Nov 2013,"You go to the beach only if you are staying in a beach facing hotel. the beach is nice although colonized by the hotels, and the swimming is poor. Water is shallow, with a nice coral and seaweed reef, but no real swimming. Head south to the island's southern tip for a more genuine beach."
Clarence C,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,Nice place to go for walks....Must see it at both high and low tides. Cycling along the entire stretch from Club Med to St Regis is also highly reccomended.
wheeder,"Alexandria, Virginia",Dec 2013,The Nusa Dua beach is white sand and very clean. The beach in not overly crowded. Several hotels have responsibility to maintain the beach near their properties and in most cases the beach is very well maintained.
fsien,Jakarta,Dec 2013,The beach is not too crowded like Kuta or Legian. The beach is cleaner with white sands. Though not much water activities here but it is a perfect place to just sit idling all day
eugenexsamantha,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,"We visited Nusa Dua beach on 19 December 2013. This is a summary of our visit: What we like:- There were hotels offering lounge chairs by the beach so you can join in and order some drinks and laze. The hotels did not seem very exclusive to me if we could just walk in, without being a hotel guest. - Water was clear. What we did not like: - No fishes at all! No opportunity to do any snorkelling. - There were jellyfishes spotted - watch out or you may be stung by one!- There was somewhat watersport activities but at expensive prices offered by ad-hoc vendors sitting by the beach. My husband enquired for jetski and he was quoted USD$55 for 30 minutes - not sure if this is the normal rate but it seemed quite pricey so we did not go ahead. - We saw a couple renting a kayak and they went kayaking but there seemed to be no regulations whatsoever. The couple were not wearing any life vests which is very dangerous. In addition, we later spotted them kayaking way past the lifebuoys and they appeared to be kayaking on the same spot as the current was very, very strong. There were no lifeguards present or anyone we could even remote approach to help the couple."
NVJ_12,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2013,The beach was very clean where you can either do a lot of water sports or maybe just sit back and relax.
elsiek,London,Dec 2013,"Nice beach - much cleaner than Sanur - with light coloured sand and easy to walk out to either of the small islands that give Nusa Dua (Dua = two) its name. Fine clean sand. Flanked by a pathway to take you past all the big hotels that make up this area. Don't be put off by the signs put out by those big hotels saying it is ""their"" beach. Our guide told us it is accessible to all and promptly marched across the supposedly private, exclusive Hyatt sand without problem. Lots of local food available as are water sports and sunchairs/umbrellas"
ujjwal13987,"Delhi, Delhi, India",Nov 2013,nothing to dislike but try to bargain as much as possible as the locals who take you for water sports will ask you a lot where as you can take from them in less than half wat they offer and same goes for street shopping or can say for ubud shopping tour if you are going.
Amy92y,"Coonamble, Australia",Aug 2013,"Nice beach, quieter than Kuta. One of the cleaner ones too.Water is clear, wasn't really a surf beach which meant it wasn't as crowded ( when we went anyway). Nice cafes close by too :)"
shangyu x,"Beijing, China",Nov 2013,"I like swim in the pool near the beach, when you are tired, there is a bar in the middle of the pool, you can sit in the stone seat in the pool , enjoy the fresh juice and cocktail...see the sea view...it's enjoyable"
DJJPerth,Perth,Nov 2013,I LOVE the people watching at Nusa Dua beach. The water is lovely and clean and lots of walks along the beach. Its magic !
JB0489,"Glasgow, UK",Nov 2013,We found this a great place to relax as it was very quiet compared with some of the other Bali beaches. Great for a walk along the water and plenty of little restaurants for drinks and some lunch. We got a lounger no problem and it cost us next to nothing for the full day. The water was shallow and calm which was a lovely change from the beach at Legian which was better suited to surfing. The sand was lovely and qhite and very clean. Would recommend eating in one of the small cafes by the beach so reasonable and the food was great.
2014FpvGt,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2013,Very clean. Whiter sand than Kuta beach. Not to many people. Easy enter to many restaurants and bars. Calmer waters for kids. Great place to do all the water sports or watch from a bar area. Last week there was several big cruise ships to look at just of the shore.
SujoyMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2013,"Visited Nusa dua beach in early November and stayed at the marriott. Most of the hotels have their own private strip and we were at the courtyard marriott area where the hotel has sundecks, and a beach club for drinks and snacks. The beach us quiet with no hawkers. You can just lie and gaze at the ocean. There is a low tide in the evenings so the sea is far away with still water left at the edge of the beach, so not a great place to go into the water, but great to lie down with a book or just laze."
OzzieMuse,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2013,It was clean without a lot of junk on the sand. Didn't swim but it looked like it was ok to do so when the tide was high. Plenty of people in the water. Very calm ocean so it would be ok for children to play in the water with their parents.
Wolf L,"Neuchâtel, Switzerland",Oct 2013,"Not being a real and enthusiast beach guy, I spent some time and evenings at the Nusa Dua Beach and beyond the hotel part. The beach here is clean and well maintained (as far as I could see, on a daily basis). Besides bathing and sport facilities, it offers various bars and nice footpaths along the beach. During night walks there were always security guards on duty. Don't miss such opportunities."
Jenn_Sweden,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2013,"You need to go far to get to deeper water. And lots of small corals at the bottom near the beach, so it is difficult for children to step in..."
LadyVoyager2013,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2012,wonderful beach to sit and watch the sun rise over archipelego. only downside was the scary tsunami warning signs everywhere
Paulus K K,"Bandung, Indonesia",Sep 2013,I found the Nusa Dua beach is just an average one.the view and waves are not spectacular.seemed not a nice beach for swimming.
cliffandjo,"Wroughton, UK",Oct 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean and quiet, the sea is very calm so easy to swim in.All in all its not a busy beach like Kuta and is only used by the tourists in the hotels.  There are not many beach vendors which makes it a stress free experience.If you are looking for the beach party scene probably not one for you but if you just want to chill and not be hassled then this could be the beach for you."
thechipman0,"Margate, UK",Nov 2012,"Lots of hawkers but stay within the hotels designated area where only certain ones are allowed, you will have no problem."
Perth_family_guy,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2013,A choice of beach activities from all the resorts. The beach is cleaned in front of the resorts daily.
Southernqt72,"Houston, TX",Oct 2013,see my review on the Westin.  It explains how unglued the water is during low tide.  Looks like a swamp.  Water not very clear.  But that could be just where we weree
yonhohoho,"Manchester, UK",Oct 2013,"If we compared with popular public beach in Bali like Kuta or Sanur, this beach gives more privacy.  Located in Nusa Dua area with 5 stars hotel around, this beach is quite clean and gives relaxing atmosphere. You can just walk around or just sit and enjoy sunrise without any disturbance or crowd."
Sal P,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is primarily accessed by people in the 5 Star resorts in Nusa Dua (which are in general fantastic). However , for a beach-loving Aussie, the beach itself is nothing special. It is clean and hassle free, and for kids who don't like waves it is good for swimming. However, the sand is average and the water not too clear. It also has a nice long boardwalk that is perfect for a morning or afternoon stroll, and is dotted with crafty stalls and massage huts. Dont waste your money with a massage at the resort - the huts are often just as good, albeit somewhat public and definitely lacking the air conditioning the spas usually offer."
Ann W,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Oct 2013," lovely beach very clean with smallish waves, and not anyone hassling you to buy stuff.  Would go again."
Amu S,Pune,Oct 2013,"its good if you are staying at any of the hotels on the beach otherwise, suggest to avoid unless u want to go to the turtle island"
sundaram g,bali,Aug 2013,"Nusa Dua Beach is located at the extreme South of the island of Bali in an area completely dedicated to 5 star hotels, the beach as such is one of the cleanest in Bali and is ideal for families with young children as there is plenty of shade and practically no waves.Nusa Dua Beach is the perfect example that with a little willingness and effort all public places in Bali could be kept clean tidy and pleasant to the eye."
ahmed s,"Cairo, Egypt",Sep 2013,very nice beach clean and not to much wave but not as it looks in pictures very quit beach clean  take a wake on the sand in front of the hotels very nice
Staffymax,"Sorrento, Australia",Oct 2013,"Clean waters and pristine sand, not many people as it was a private part of the Nusa Dua Novotel.They were putting in a beach path while we were there which should be really good!"
Gezginkafa h,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jun 2013,"to  enjoy an amazing sea, you need to go early in the morning. otherwise it's wavy and seems dirty.wonderful sand and peaceful"
srihartamas,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2013,"Almost deserted, the portion of the beach was specially for Mercure Nusa Dua  guest. So unlike Kuta Beach which was overcrowded and full of vendors and busy traffic. Nusa Dua's beach is so pristine and windy, you could sleep the time away and just do nothing. A place to be with yourself."
SouthAfrica-Pretoria,South Africa,Sep 2013,"Beach are very busy with boats, not a great swimming area. The beach at Kuta much better for swimming."
Jon L,"Port Orange, FL",Nov 2012,"We liked the relaxing atmosphere, the landscape of the hotel grounds, the food, the service, the beach."
Abimanyu Malewar,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2013,"Beach looks beautiful, aligned with all the high end hotels. Water is extremely shallow. Really cant swim here. Food and drinks have to bought from from one of the hotel bars or restaurants. Good place if you just want to sun bathe and relax by the beach."
Derris L,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jun 2013,"Imagine nobody is here, a sandy beach to yourself, well not at all possible, too crowded, watch when you are going, you bound to step on someone half buried under the sand. A beach ideal for a quick dip and surfing, but unfortunately some hotels monopolise the better part"
ashuc,"Island of Malta, Malta",Sep 2013,Very clam and serene but don't come here if you want waves. It is maybe very unlike other beaches with no breakers but safe and clean. Lots of Luxury hotels are on the beach so you wont be sp
lee n,adelaide,May 2013,tidal beach- swim at risk in between floating foreign matter unknown objects windsurfing equipment old and outdated canoes just float -dont go out too far- could be a long swim in
KimandTodd,"Trowbridge, UK",Sep 2013,"Lovely sandy beach, few pebbles, lovely warm sea.  Plenty of sunbeds and very attentive staff at the Melia Hotel.  A few beach sellers toting sarongs, and jewellery"
thejoneses4218,"Mermaid Waters, Australia",Aug 2013,Best at high tide although still pleasant at low tide but always clean and staff at the beach were only too willing to assist.
SSLOVEKK,"El Paso, TX",Oct 2012,It's one of the best beach at Bali island. The scenic there is beatiful. It's very suitable to hang out and play for the family. But the sand is not soft enough :)
JMc_on_the_go,"Santa Cruz, CA",Sep 2013,Great views on this expansive beach. Some litter detracted from the ambiance. Was good to visit after the hotels organized a massive clean up. Lot's of surf board rentals but saw no surfers. 
Shas74,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2013,"Beach is clean and just shallow enough, kids love it a lot, they just want to spend entire day . . . Out in the sun"
johlin-13,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2013,"very expensive,$65 us  2pax to turtle island .we stopped to have a snorkel 200 yards from beach with about ten boats around a pontoon did a ten foot circle of the coral outcrop and that was it. the sea walkers were below us. a fifteen foot footpath under water with a hand rail,the top of their helmets were two inches under water.I think that activity cost $90us make up your own minds about that,turtle island was fine though."
Mumu,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2013,It is a simple beautiful beach with white sandFrom there you can see some kind mangrove island and a lot of private beach belongs to few hotelsIf you take a walk a bit you can see Ramayana statue  
ChuckOfAllTrades,"Goa, India",Aug 2013,"Pristine clean water and sand. Quiet, not too many people. Stunning views. There's also a small elevated area with a garden - if you explore a little, you find some excellent views. No idea what this area is called, sadly - but do check out my photos, and you'll see what I mean.Perfect place to lie down for a couple of hours and read with a Kindle. Enjoy the waves and the oh so gorgeously blue waters..."
Joefromsg,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,Have to spend an hour or two here. Like the clear sea water at this beach. Great to spend a relaxing time on this clean nice and quiet beach
999Lily999,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",Aug 2013,"Clean, safe, very good for small kids. Local sellers on the beach friendly and not annoying. Hotel security ascertains customers' peace and privacy. The ""Golden Cage"" as locals call this area of luxury hotels."
rockyEssex,essex,Aug 2013,"Quite crowded,  could never get a bit of shade,  all the other hotels had plenty of sunbeds free etc,  but had to get down there before the crowd,  they were going down at 7am to put towels on the beds"
SiskaOS,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Apr 2013,"Well... nusa dua beach is a nice beach actually...but lately the condition is not good anymore. Several of plastics, bottle are everywhere. I hope we'll back to have a beautiful beach like a few years ago"
Luc L,"Westport, CT",Jul 2013,we live in AU on the beach - so average by standards. low tide exposes a huge coral reef. spent more time in the pool area
Debbie T,Kirkland,Jul 2013,"We found the Nusa Dua beaches to be dirty, including the beach area which was strewn with litter and the water.  "
Wendy F,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,"This is a very pretty bay that is safe to swim, the tide does go out quite far but fishing and rock-pooling in the shallows are fun. There is very little litter at this end and the sellers are not allowed to hassle on the beach, a polite No thank you will suffice."
Nins,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2013,"The beaches here are glorious  with white soft sand and safe for swimming. The public beach is the best to head to if you are not staying at Nusa Dua.It has loads of activities on the beach like flying fish, donut, banana boat, jet ski, para sailing and many more. The beach is at its best when it’s sunny to have a view of beautiful hues of water. There are massage facilities, restaurant, locker facility, shower facility also available. You can have a gala time here."
Shuan1984,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,"Nusa Dua, is paradise. The beach has fine, clean sand and the ocean was sparkling clear- amazing how far you can walk out!! Cloudless skies and cool winds also made the beach a perfect place to spend a full day there. Such amazing quality was unexpected as my first memory of Bali's beach was the complete opposite (had stayed at Kuta)."
Piv14_13,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2013,The beach is best visited in the morning as the tide goes out  around 2ish. The water is very clean although you need to watch out for the rocks - I stubbed my big toe on a sharp rock - ouch! You must also visit the blowhole which is walking distance up a small lookout
Somchai71,"Chonburi, Thailand",Aug 2013,"The section we were staying on was maintained by the resort hotels that run along it and was spotless and at low tide there is a load of puffer fish can be found in the seaweed in the shallow water. If you take goggles you can find hermit crabs, sea urchins (not many but watch your step) and baby lobsters. No hawkers on our section either but if you go up to the public section there are a few but if you're not interested and politely refuse they'll wander on and leave you alone."
WahanaBali,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2013,nusa dua beach is the best beach in Bali.people who visit this beach will find relaxing and peaceful ..
susmaya,Sweden,Aug 2013,The Hawkers and beach vendors are few here so you get to relax in the sun for once! The sea is calm and no big vawes so its ideal for kids. A bit windy tho during our stay but its nice with a breeze.
KathleenCards,"Evesham, UK",Aug 2013,The beach is beautiful in front of the Hyatt however the public part is not cleaned therefore rubbish is collected when the tide is up and floats in the sea despite the hotels doing their best to clean up the sandy part of their beach. 
erkwan,"Sidoarjo, Indonesia",Aug 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is still quite n natural. In most of the time we Had our holiday,I n my fam stayed in Benoa n Nusa Dua. The beach is nice for my kidz playing,swimming n snorkling. For snorkling we found one nice Spot in Nusa Dua,especially a long the new development area such as Regis,Ayodya. In that area,my husband n my boy having a nice snorkling. So,bring your snorkling in that beach."
Drew Jones,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2013,A patrolled beach - just swim between the flags.  Safe for kids and the water is good.  They could use a beach cleaner to improve it but it is ok and not too much coral in the sand.
Alan L,"Hong Kong, China",Aug 2013,"Very good beach, mostly owned by private hotels, could be a little cleaner. A lot of activities to do!"
mariamarsianad,"Banjarmasin, Indonesia",Jun 2013,"Our journey in Bali on June 25-27, 2013 enjoyable. We spent our time to visit Nusa Dua Beach. Where we go there is Restaurant Bebek Bengil here in the bay view. Very quiet, clean beach, we just visited, not stay in Nusa Dua Beach, because we have stayed in Kuta. We spent our time enjoyable. Welcome & visit Nusa Dua Beach, Bali"
Sarah D,186 contributions,Jan 2013,We hired a jetski and it was fantastic. My partner also really enjoyed the surf. He did lots of cool tricks on his surfboard because he is really good.

Tom F,4 contributions,Aug 2013,"such a nice beach! white sand...clear water! quite rare in bali! unfortunately, it is totally taken by big hotels. even the beach was empty, the security told us that the beach only for hotel guests......what happened to the paradise bali.....? bali - only for rich people!"
Gill B,Adelaide,Aug 2013,"Everything, just be aware the eat as much as you like buffet can be expensive. Beach is fantastic and always very clean. Staff in the hotel are amazing."
Crofton M,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Aug 2013,Nusa Dua beach runs along the front of various time share and resort properties.  In the front of some properties they have taken care of rubbish and their pathways.  Others are not very tidy and there are breaks along the beachwalk in front of undeveloped properties.  Floating rubbish is common
cclombok,"Lombok, Indonesia",Jul 2013,"When you need a secluded, nice, white sand and clean beach, this is the place to go! You won't find a lot of beach hawkers here, which you will experience if you go to Kuta. Nice view also over the Nusa Lembongan island."
Peter C,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2013,"Clean shallow water, nice warm quiet waters. Hawkers not too pushy. Amazing sand that the kids will love."
Melanie C,Bangkok,Apr 2013,A great beach with shallow water. My son made friends with some local children and had a great time playing in the water and making sandcastles. Take a walk out to the water blow. - very cool! Take drinks and snacks as they can only be bought at the very expensive beachside restaurants. 
Maxon2511,"San Francisco, CA",Jul 2013,"We made an appointment for our photo session before noon a day before flying out of Bali.  If anybody would mention Bali.......beach comes to mind right away.  So, our intended location was the beach.  Veronika was our photographer.  She made us feel comfortable right from the start and she knew what she was doing.  It was a gamble on our part because it was our last day at Bali, if something goes wrong, there will be no way and no chance for a double take.  We started the photo shoot in the hotel property and the final setting was the (Nusa Dua) beach.  We posed, walked, ran, jumped, played role and some candid shots at the beach.  Our pants/shorts got wet by the waves but it turned out to be the highlight of the session.  The 6 pm scheduled preview was fun but overwhelming because we had to choose from the 354 shots taken.  Our preliminary number was 81 photos.  We were going to review the 81 photos to reduce it some more but then the male staff interrupted and offered us a deal....the first deal was not good enough and we refused....he sweetened the deal a bit more and we went off tip toeing our way to the restaurant for a special dinner.  Nice and friendly people to work with and they have a real good sense of humor.  The photos at the beach are the best ones!!!"
FrankBali47,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"visiting Nusa Dua you have several nice beaches to go.1/ Geger beach is a famous one with some small local restaurants on the spot.It is next to the HUGE and very luxury hotel Mulya hotel, that is claiming the beach in front of hotel as private. In my opinion ridicilious because guests of that hotel remain in garden and private pools. They have too many security to control the beach. But next to this hotel it is stll ""normal"" and often tourists come from Kuta or Jimbaran to see the Nusa Dua scenery.2/ Also you have pantai Mengiat (pantai means beach) next to Ayodia resort (before it was Hilton Bali) My favourite place for drink and food on the beach is this beach in Nusa Dua with the village (banjar) cooperation cafe/restaurant Warung Yasa Segara, the only one on the spot. You can sit/lay on the beach or sit on the lawn under a tree in front of the restaurant or under the roof enjoying drinks or reasonable price/quality food (but they can improve...!!)."
Vatsal S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2013,Clean and not too mnay hawkers. Beach in nearby Benoa can be dirty. Not windy unlike a other places in Nusa Dua as sheltered.
Lovers665,"Sydney, Australia",May 2013,"Beach was clean and almost deserted, beach dinners were great, band entertainment was excellent every time."
verasiagian,jakarta,Jul 2013,I love it since it is very quite and beautiful. The beach is white shandy beach even though is not as white as dreamland beach.
Suddu85,"New York City, NY",Jul 2013,"Very clean and neat beach. There is low tide on most afternoons, during which the water level recedes considerably and beach becomes rocky. Visit early mornings or late evening for a great experience."
Chaluqs,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2012,"What I like: Clean, pristine water. The sands are crystal white. Beach is not open to public, which means only hotel stayers are on the beach which makes it great and quietWhat I dislike: I am those type who likes to play with waves. The water at nusa dua is extremely calm. It is not fun"
Erwin K,"Bandung,Indonesia",Jun 2013,"Long stretch of the Nusa Dua beach privately owned by the hotels, such as Melia Bali,the Lagoon resort,the Westin etc.On the northern side of Nusa Dua beach,near the tip of Tanjung Benoa,was heaven for watersport enthusiast.Can do parasailing,banana boat,jet ski"
Lorrisydney H,"Cherrybrook, Australia",Jul 2013,"I love this beach as it is very calm water and suitable for non swimmers and swimmers alike - it is in a bay and really lovely.  At low tide, the water goes out and you can then wander around the sandy little pools looking at various things that are left - like little crabs etc."
roshwini,"Malacca City, Melaka, Malaysia",Jul 2013,"its alright if you just come for the view and to stroll along the beach, but for swimming, it is so-so. I have definitely seen better, even krabi and koh phi phi were heaps better. There was a problem with rubbish and litter could be seen at some stretches of the beach. Quite disgusting. At some parts, this was after we entered grand hyatt's compound illegally, we saw bottle caps and plastic food wrappers and whatnot floating around in the water. However, some parts of the beach is nice and had clear waters. definitely, much better than Kuta beach though"
Acsgcs,"Narbethong, Australia",Jul 2013,"The southern beach is better than the northern but both have a lot of litterNorthern beach has water sports, southern has nothing except water - much more peaceful and great walking.Northern has a lot more things include market people, hawkers, etcMore exciting but busy. Better paths too."
Farizan25,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2013,"The beach is just good enough for a stroll and a quick swim.  It is a good idea if you want to get away from crowded Kuta Beach and come to Nusa Dua for the beach.  Worthwhile and stunning, especially for couples."
ExPat0331,"Arlington, VA",Jul 2013,"Good beach, but was just not impressed.  Hawaii and Bermuda have better beaches.  Nusa Dua is more shallow....like not even thigh deep.  It served it's purpose, but it's more hype than anything else."
Aaron F,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jun 2013,"We took a taxi ride from Legian to here to get away from the over-crowded Kuta Beach. We weren't disappointed at all. The beach (Geger Beach) is stunning. It stretches on for (guessing) 5km. If I'm being picky, the sand is difficult to walk on and the sea isn't good to swim in. The waves are extremely strong. Not suitable for young toddlers. However, we found a spot on the Novotel sun beds and stayed there all afternoon. Very beautiful beach and was thoroughly impressed. So much better than Kuta. If I'm not mistaken, you can see the Uluwatu Temple on the edge of the cliff by the Mulia Hotel. A must if you would like a private, relaxing afternoon/stay away from the madness of Kuta."
Miley02,Philippines,Jun 2013,You you've been to the white sand beaches you will be disappointed here.  The sand is light brown and the the beach gets deep right away.
chackoka,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Jun 2013,"Calm, shallow, uncrowded beach with lots of facilities for water sports. The beach is clean and uncluttered."
Holidaymaker753,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2013,"Lovely Clean beach.  Hawkers are restricted on the beach, they can only come onto beach for 1 hour .  Each hawker has a licence number that gives them a certain time to go onto beach. This was fantastic as you were no constantly pestered while getting a  lovely tan. "
jure n,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Jun 2013,"From the outside the beach looks amazing, but underwater there is just sea grass. Keep in mind the tide, because when the sea gets back away from the beach you can't swim there."
Sa H,Gravesend,Jul 2012,"lovely clean beach and water, plenty of shade if required and lots of fish to swim with close by.  Perfect for relaxing."
putri d,bandung,Jun 2013,If you come with your coupel..this great place for take a picture or private beach just you and your coupel.
Clive F,"Ashby, Australia",Jun 2013,The Beach to the left hand side of the Conrad was really poor . It really needs to be cleaned up.If you walked right and managed to climb all the sand that has been dumped on the footpath by the building site .Shame on you Holiday Inn .The Beaches are not bad at all . 
chetnahira,India,May 2013,The beach near Denpasar was better though cleanliness obviously has be applauded and Turtle Island gives all water sports activity
Xena1982,"Beit Mery, Lebanon",Aug 2012,"When we went there last year in August 2012, the beach is nice, quiet and relaxing. The breeze of wind is nice and soothing. the sand is clean but the water needs a little bit of cleaning from all the Algae which is a bit disturbing to me. The sellers hold their distance from the tourists but they could be a bit annoying sometimes. Anyway it was nice lounging there and enjoying the beach of our Hotel which is walking distance from where we were staying."
D3sm0nd_L0w,"Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia",May 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is a more quiet beach compared to the bustling Legian beach. The main stretch of the beach is dominated by hotels, therefore hotel residents are most of the visitors of this particular beach. Unlike Legian beach which you have food stalls along the beach, this beach is full with sunbath coaches - so a splendid location for a quiet afternoon reading. There are plenty of locations under the shade too if one is not a fan of sunbath.The waves were strong during my visit in May."
Rain_maple,3 contributions,Apr 2013,What a beautiful to walk down! I wish I could stay whole day there without thinking busy life! Very quiet with blue sky and wind.. Wonderful ! 
mleigh32,"Laguna Niguel, CA",Jun 2012,"The kelp farmers were the best part of Nusa Dua - something we would never see in US. They are hard working, friendly and keep the beach immaculate."
Deden Setiawan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2013,Nice & Clean Beach. You have to rent a car or bicycle to get there or you have to booked hotel around nusa dua area but it's not cheap.
Sumbul T,"Bengaluru, India",May 2013,If you have the time this is the beach to laze around all day in. There is a water blow near it which is truly amazing.
JasonL4,"Brighton, UK",May 2013,"Great walk along the coast also past the other hotels. View at sunrise is stunning. Likewise, watching the clouds forming in the late afternoon on the horizon is impressive."
Graham G,"Canberra, Australia",Jun 2012,The Ayodya Hotel has a provate beach with security and a nearby salt water pool if you don't want to go in the sea.  Very clean and a lovely spot to just hang out.  Some did - all day!
Julie J,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2013,"We could jump in the water & not worry about our things, though we were there ourselves, its a great beach for little ones "
Jayson C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2013,"went for watersport, pretty pricey for a basic stuffs. becarefull not to get cheated there! there are alot of spots and they will accept USD too."
Sally-anne K,"Canberra, Australia",Apr 2013,"It really was very lovely and clean and well kept.  Sadly I have been spoilt in the Maldives and will not swim in anything not completely clear, turquiose and sparkly!  "
Jody M,Australia,May 2013,"So quiet, so pretty.... a coconut drink under the umbrella, no hassling from hawkers...bliss.  The restaurant on the beach delivered food to us so we didn't have to move..more bliss. So add the cheap meal and it was a lovely experience"
Doesjka,"Hamilton, New",Apr 2013,"The beach outside the resort (we stayed at The Westin) was stunning and very well groomed.  There is a reasonable amount of seaweed and rubbish (namely plastic bags) that float in the water from beaches elsewhere.The sand is beautiful, water temperature amazing in April, however we did get a couple of little stings (didn't last for long) but it was enough to send us back to the pool.We walked around the bay further (south side) which is where the locals hang out and the beach is absolutely littered with plastic bottles and bags.  Not so nice but important to see how the locals live versus the tourists."
GunturDewandaruputra,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Jun 2012,"nice , and is very good . play with japanese girl on the beach,liked to do with what's there. work as a guide in jakarta and bali meets japan girl I really like it and I started to fall in love on the beach Bali, Nusa Dua"
amylouise439,"sydney, australia",Apr 2013,"The beach is beautiful for Bali. Sitting on the beach outside our resort the Westin was lovely. The sand, for Bali, was clean and soft. We found swimming better (obviously) during high tide however there was still rubbish that was swept in which formed a barrier to get through prior to getting to clear swimming water (gross).  Low tide provided the best viewing and gave the hotel staff time to clear the rubbish that had accumulated. Nice to walk along at sunset however the wet sand does not harden like Australian beaches, and instead each step lands you ankle and sometimes shin high in sand and water."
JeanKlang,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2013,"Brilliant , we had a very good time in Melia Bali and the beach was in perfect condition during night and during day"
Frankandnida,"Emerald, Australia",Apr 2013,"Nice to have private beach for each hotel along the beach,the beach are clean and good for relaxing."
Kira C,Singapore,Apr 2013,"I have been to nicer beaches like in Phuket, Tioman Island, Perth, Miami etc. Bali is nowhere near the same standards.The water isn't clear. The beach isn't fantastic. I wonder why is it called a beach resort. There are a lot of con men there as well. The car rentals with drivers are rip off. The drivers quote you exorbitant prices and take you for a ride to expensive restaurants (further rip off) and lousy souvenir shops. It is a disappointment and I wouldn't be going back unless it is a free trip."
Lamboswede,California,Apr 2013,The beach is good but the sand is a bit dark for my taste. I prefer that really white sand so you get that green clear water.
HeatherAustralia,Australia,Apr 2013,Beach Club Novotel is on Nusa Dua beach and I found this a great place to relax and enjoy the sea breeze.  I was fortunate to try a beach massage whilst visiting.   Absolutely bliss for only 100.000 Rupiah ($10)
kristinahollie,"Minneapolis, MN",Nov 2012,Great waves and beach down by the Hyatt.  Not so great up by the Hilton.  Less surf and less dramatic low tide.  
Marney B,"Townsville, Australia",Apr 2013,I went here for the watersports.  I think they were over priced and the place was too busy.  Plus we couldn't do half of the sports on the day (e.g. Parasailing)
sue c,"Grimsby, UK",Nov 2012,"clean white sand, still waters, low tide can walk right out to reef. little issue with seaweed washing up but hotel constantly clear it"
JUN X,"Shanghai, China",Apr 2013,"beautiful beach with nice view,quiet and clean.I saw the beautiful sunrise.the kid likes the beach very much."
Arth06,"Milan, Italy",Aug 2012,"The beach isnt that clean and the waves at this end arent that high. More a spot for water-sports - para sailing, speed boat riding etc. The beach is lined with different stalls for water sports, and the moment you arrive you are surrounded by there representatives to get you to sign up with them.   One should take a look at a few of these stalls and then decide. The water sports seem to be decently priced but the time allotted to you is pretty short."
johnberndt,"New York City, NY",Nov 2012,"This is a peaceful beach cove amongst all the big wave surfer beaches in Bali. You can laze the day away here in this tranquil setting. The beautiful wide white sandy beach is very swimmable, good for children and adults. Not crowded with hawkers, policed and secure. Nice walking path past all the resorts."
ramjets5,Brisbane,Apr 2013,"We went out on a glass bottom boat to the reef. There is some live reef, but the water is murky and viewing very limited and fish life disappointing. The beaches are covered in litter at low tide. Next time ill just spend more time by the pool at the villa!"
fatma n,makassar,Apr 2013,"i stayed at Nusa Dua Beach with my little family for a short vacation in April 2013. I love the Bali's atmosphere in this hotel, its real happening. my spacious enough room at left wing ( I forget the wing""s name) of the hotel makes me can see the part of nusa dua white sandy beach and trees with many playing squirrels just in front of my room's terrace. for those who wants to enjoy sunbathing without disturbed by too many common tourist from other place, this hotel is highly recomended. I really enjoy the private beach in this hotel, its so different with Kuta or Dreamland that become so crowded at weekend. wanna enjoy the holiday on beach ?? Nusa Dua Hotel is the right place.."
shaan j,"Southall, UK",May 2012,This beach is quite shallow so ideal if you have small kids who like to paddle although a bit irritating for adults who want to swim as you have to wade out half a mile till you drop straight into the ocean if you want to snorkel.
Luvshiraz,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2013,Beach cleaned daily by hotel staff - lovely!  Huge surf - Watch undertow.  Wonderful for morning beach walks and evening star-gazing.
Brizzle11,"Bristol, UK",Apr 2013,Beautiful beach but has lots of rubbish when the tide is out. Just needs to be cleaned up ore often. Great rock pools when the tide is out!
kye4124,"Wanneroo, Australia",Apr 2013,"We went on the banana boat & the flying fish. Banana boat was very tame but the flying fish was excellent! Gets you airborne behind a speedboat, great fun for only $20. Heaps of other water sports here, parasailing, snorkelling etc. suggest you spend at least half a day so you can try them, beach itself was not very nice, but your not here for swimming."
MDontherun,"Ottawa, Canada",Apr 2013,Long stretch of beach that can be walked and explored. Lots of vendors but they generally leave you along unless you show interest. When the tide is high the water is quite nice. 
AzharJohar,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2013,Beach has nice waves and clean water. Beach is very near to the hotel and the swimming pool. Cabana rentals are also provided. Beach chairs are plenty. 
125Annie,"Tampico, Mexico",Dec 2012,"A great beach to walk around, think, relax and just be submerged in the ocean sounds and atmosphere.."
Klak2009,"Houston, TX",Oct 2012,"Very Calm beach! Great view! Nice for a walk, swimming or just relaxing under the sun (or at the Kiosks)"
falala_farahain,Singapore,Apr 2013,"Nothing much offered here. Signed up for water sports package which cost about US$28 consisting of parasailing, jetski and banana boat. They rushed you to do the activities and then done. Intended to relax but was disappointed at the mad rush through the activities. Not worth it. Dont bother unless you have never seen a beach. "
Balihotels,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"really nice Beachfront hotels, i loves gated area, nice sand and able to walk quite a ways. It's worth a trip if you want to swim at a nice sand beach"
Payoh,Singapore,Mar 2013,The water is not crystal clear clean and a lot of broken sea shell along the beach not world class. but good view for sunraise.
Fastphilad,Mich,Mar 2013,"Granted, Nusa Dua, is not representative of everyday life in Bali, but it may be the Bali you think of if it's going to be your first trip or for a short time.  In a gated area, nice sand and able to walk quite a ways.  It's worth a trip if you want to swim at a nice sand beach"
Anthony D,"Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia",Mar 2013,was good sand where we stayed. Pleasant surroundings. great little bay but swim no further than the buoys
ErikaQLD,"Queensland, Australia",Mar 2013,We enjoyed the Beach.  It was clean and pleasant.  The Restaurant Club 2.28 has a great Menu and Theme Nights.
Jill4920,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2013,"Nice sand,warm water,not overly crowded,Most resorts provide sun  lounges ,umbrellas ,cabanas,drink waiters.Locals were selling wares on beach but were not intrusive."
Boris G,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2013,"Nice sand, comfortable sunbeds, good service and very warm water. Unfortunately it is impossible to swim in the ocean when it is low tide, e. e. at least a half of the day."
The50s,"Mortdale, Australia",Mar 2013,Calm waters and warm... We only swam in the Conrad beach compound... It was clean and we had towel and water service.
Bearhug1,"Toronto, Canada",Mar 2013,clean and not crowed!  beautiful for long walks- highly recommend if you are looking for peace and quiet!
Sotiris11,"Agios Stefanos, Greece",Aug 2012,"Look. I'm Greek and I have swimmed in, most possibly, some of the best seas and beaches in the world. Having said that, I think that the Nusa Dua beach is below average. You almost can't swim because of the large waves which try to get you out of the sea. Signs on the beach warn you of dangerous sea animals. And during the daily tide in the afternoon you can see all garbage that other tourists have thrown in the sea in the recent past. Apart from all that, you can lie on a bed, get a sun tan and enjoy the view - not during the tide, of course."
percyvakil,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2012,"Compared to some of the other beaches in Bali, Nusa Dua Beach is relatively quiet. Nusa means island, and Dua means two, which is how the beach got it's name. There are two little islands where sand has now settled to form the beach.Part of the beach is occupied by a row of luxury hotels, part open, used for watersports of many kinds."
rudy s,"San Jose, Costa Rica",Feb 2013,You have to go....the sand and view is great... fantastic for a romantic walk on the beach.....Feb could be very windy so check the weather forecast 
wanderlust0055,New York,Mar 2013,"we stayed near kuta beach but didnt like it much as its very commercialized. thanks to our driver, we decided to go to nusa dua beach and kid you not, it was one of the best beaches ive been too. the water was clear and green-blue in colour. people just laid back or swam in the sea. noone bothered us with water sports activities. a private getaway especially for couples!!"
Helena M,"Espoo, Finland",Feb 2013,"Long beach, seagrass during lowtide. There are some snorkeling sites a bit further but boat drivers will take you there for 200 IDR (~25 EUR)."
Eunice_Lau,Malaysia,Feb 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is awesome. There have a lot of water spot there like (snorkeling,banana boat,flying fish,jet ski,glass bottom boat,diving,turtle island and etc). You can purchase a ticket to turtle island but it is quite expensive. The ticket costs IDR 250,000/person and there is nothing to see at turtle island. Just a few turtles in the ponds, an eagle, a snake, a chameleon, two hornbills, few bats and birds there. However, you can drive to Nusa Dua Water Blow area (no need entrance fee), the view is amazing. It is a nice place to take photos and enjoy the sea breeze."
pnMazzy,malaysia,Mar 2013,"In overall, the beach at Nusa Dua is cleaner and calmer than in Kuta. However there are not much different between those in terms of scenery and commercial activity. Sport activities seller are everywhere and aggressively approaching for business, which really spoil the mood and the atmosphere. Balinese government should really work harder in the public infrastructures, especially waste management system for cleaner beach."
shellyy185,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Beach was so beautiful. The sands looks like pearl, and is very suitable for surfing. Large beach area, peacefull. Not so far from Tanjung Benoa."
Donna P,"West Hollywood, CA",Mar 2013,this beach is just so beautiful and after spending many mornings walking up the beach path i must say the people you meet are so lovely and the staff of others resorts always quick to say slamat pagi love it..
ms_ayu96,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2012,"Nusa dua beach located in the lower east bali island. It has more calm wave, but if you like to play in the sea ; just a couple block north you will find tanjung benoa which is famous for its water activity.I prefer this spot because is way less crowdy than kuta beach, this one is also cleaner and also packed with 5 stars hotels.Really good place to have your morning stroll or even have your night running."
mark r,"Fremantle, Australia",Feb 2013,"our first visit to Nusa Dua Bali,stay in Nusa Dua hotel,,just walk around Nusa Dua Garden and do some shoping,was wanderfulsecond day explore to nusa dua beach just for couple of hours that was very nice ,we spend more time in Nusa Dua beach coz really nice,after firs visit to the beach we need to come back more time,that same like must to visit,,our kid love this beachthanks marck"
kittentravels,"Saint Kilda, Victoria, Australia",Jan 2013,"Really touristy beach, visit if you like beaches and don't have anything else to do- yet I feel that there is a lot more culture and colour to see in Bali than at just another beach. Quite a big surf spot. "
Merothehero,"Calgary, Canada",May 2012,"But watch out for the tide... it takes water waaaaaaaaaaay off the shore! :) We went in May, and the water was still not warm enough for a swim :)"
johnbudi77,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"The beach is clean with a white sand beach. Not very large wave, suitable for children to swim on the beach."
Intan R.,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Jan 2013,"It was okay. But those who like water activities, this is definitely your place. You can also go to turtle island from here. "
Yardan,Kalkan,Feb 2013,"Beach is nice but there is to much jetski. so you can't go to far. You can't see to much fish or underwater world close to beach. You need to take a boat and tell them so they will take you coral and fish area, which is much better."
Lena G,"Shanghai, China",Feb 2013,Very nice beach but not a nice place for swimming. It would be fantastic to stay in the spa houses on the beach and reading a book. But the beach itself is a little bit disappoint as the sands are rough and hurting and the sea water is not as clean as in OZ.
Pranav S,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Mar 2012,"I loved this beach. It was so nice & clean, plus so many outlets for water sports (we tried everything except the sea-walker. diving was a bit boring )You can have a nice walk, & eat at the shacks of hotels or independent ones. We tried a few, non were bad.the water is so clear that you can see the bottom for a few feet."
h_viii,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2013,"Good for families as clean and no-one hassling you (as compared to Kuta beach). You can use the beach chairs and shade and the wate was very calm, so safe for the kids"
Beccc,34 contributions,Jan 2013,Great beach. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt and this section of the beach was well cared for by the Grand Hyatt. Sand was raked daily. Lots of chairs and even some Bali huts to laze in by the water.
GemiAgung,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"the beach was nice, quite, not as crowed as kuta beach. a lot of 5 stars hotel located at this beach.  "
IndiaUKdoc,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2013,"This beach in Nusa Dua is great and beautiful. There is a shower and half decent toilets. Use the cafe if beach chairs too steep, they do not mind as long as you keep sipping the arak based cocktail"
travelbunny0306,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2013,"The beach is clean and calm. Very suitable for kids. My little boy whom is 1, enjoyed the beach so much that he refuses to the leave the beach when we wanted to have a rest in the room!"
Ian H,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2013,Nice strip of beautiful hotels but the water is a little cloudy.lovely path along the seaside with beautiful trees and palms
Annehurdyhamadiddle,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2013,Each day beach is raked and any seaweed removed. Not crowded with sellers. Great walking path along the beach.
A_Visitor_2010,"Bangkok, Thailand",Feb 2012,"Beach is just average or below it and perhaps overrated. Your hotel may be on the beach, but that may not add much value to it."
Muhammad B,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2012,"A very nice beach, completely swimmable and perfect temperature. The other beaches in Bali are nowhere near as nice.Not the greatest beach on the planet but certainly the nicest beach on Bali"
Kristi_Turner,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2012,"The sand and beach at Nusa Dua are really good.  The water is refreshing.  You can walk up the beach and snorkel out on the reef and let the current take you back to where you started.  It's definitely not the great barrier reef, but is still a good beach.  They have other activities such as catermarans, windsurfing and kayaking"
Hannah,"Washington DC, DC",Jun 2012,a little annoying that people try to sell you crap you don't want but it's a gorgeous bali white sand beach!
MelReed23,"Seaford, South Australia, Australia",Dec 2012,"My sister and I did the jet skiing here, was awesome fun! Both went on the same jet ski together so got to drive it. I've done parasailing here before as well back in 2008 which was wicked fun - wanted to do it again but the wind was going the wrong way. Beautiful place."
COPINF,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2012,Nusa Dua Municipality must start to clean its beaches as well as sea to make it more crystall-clear to attract more colorfull fishes to swim between.
Shawn B,"Tampa, FL",Dec 2012,"Great white sand and a classic beach look.  However, there is no real marine life in the water, making it very stale to those who enjoy seeing fish"
asien_as,"Labuan Bajo, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"When you visit Nusa dua beach, there are some point i need to mention: you may need to visit the Water Blow, taking picture with the Giant Statue of Rama, Go to the Left side and walk through some wild plants and you will arrived at a cliff side and the view were amazingly Beautiful... you can see water, sky, beach, forest and seems smaller Rama Statue there."
Oliver S,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2013,"Areas clened by hotels such as the Conrad, Grand Hyatt and St Regis are great. There is still a lot of trash in the water though."
Kenneth O,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2012,If it like peace and quiet thesis the place not crowded like kuta . We just chill. Out and sat on the bench and just listen to the waves sound splashing and the sand was just nice not too coarse nor too powdery 
ManFromMinneapolis,"Minneapolis, MN",Oct 2012,"Good news is there are no surfers or their personalities or their families.  Bad news is there are absolutely no waves at all...  Great for snorkling or chilling by the beach, bad if you want to ride the waves...  If you stay at the right resort, you wont regret it..."
BK_TheTraveller,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2012,"Just kved this beach the most, very nice, very clean serene and yet private. One of the places where most activities happen.... The water sports and the fun begins here..."
Dr_Miami,"London, UK",Oct 2012,I stayed away from this beach as it was very dirty - full of motorised fishing and recreational boats.
Suzanne6304,Wales,Jul 2012,"This is probably the nicest beach on Bali, it is a beautiful cove, the tides rise and fall dramatically allowing you excellent swimming when the tide is in and fascinating beachcombing when the tide is out, always wear a beach sandal as the whole area is teeming with anenomes. It is fascinatinating to watch the local fishermen carry out their trade. The only annoying thing is the beach vendors, but if you are firm they will leave you alone. Only pay about a third of what they ask for always haggle them down."
jachelletraveler,singapore,Dec 2012,"we took the package of snorkelling , jetski and turtle island. snorkelling was average with free underwater camera thrown in gratis . I think Tioman is better. the waters are not crystal clear but fishes are there. Turtle island was fun for the kids - lots of animals at close proximity for photographs. Nice and friendly guides.Jetskis are new and fun but the 15 miniutes promised turned out to be 11 minutes. complained to the timekeeper but just got waved off. there is shower after the whole affair . overall goodretrospectively , should have bargained for a lower price or more activities thrown in. Our driver reminded us but we forgot"
hharrison1997,"Marcoola, Australia",Dec 2012,Great place to spend a few hours or a whole day. Water very clean and safe and sand clean and white. 
Angela40,"Springfield, Australia",May 2012,"Beach outside resort was OK, was dirty if you ventured beyond resort boundaries.  Water was not very inviting."
Jo Beth,"Noosa, Australia",Dec 2012,"After travelling to Bali 10 times before, I decided to stay at the Laguna Hotel Nusa Dua.The beach was the best Ive seen so far in Bali and the Laguna was an amazing hotel. Great facilities, staff were so friendly and helpful and the food was delicious!. Would go back there anyday. Highly recommended."
Chris G,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2012,Great place to relax and watch the world go by.  No haggling from the usual Kuta sellers of wares.  Great place to enjoy water sports or just lay back and drink a cold Bintang.
AngeloHD,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2012,"Great clean water, great sunbeds and service from the resorts. Staff always ready to help and take your order"
YH_Poh,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2012,The beach is very relaxing in the early evening. One can choose to order a nice drink and relax on a lounge chair or have a nice stroll with yr love ones
BartCrowther,"Cronulla, Australia",Oct 2012,"Nice and clean at the resort, Bali Tropic seemed to have the largest beach compared to most resorts in Nusa Dua"
KerryYumYum,"Norwich, UK",Dec 2012,Just beautiful! We went to Nusa Dua to visit friends staying at the Melia Bali. Hotel and beach were wonderful
Tessa S,"Coolangatta, Australia",Nov 2012,We love the beach here but we got hassled to buy things so I was hard to just relax otherwise it was gorgeous.
alannah2010,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2012,"Plenty of beach lounges available however the beach had a lot of sea weed which I do not like -so ""paddled ""only and used the sea water pool at the resort"
Maureen F,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2012,"Lovely clean beach, never crowded, with good walking pathway to other hotels and blow-hole.  Looks particularly good at evening time."
Lina Jasin,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2012,"Sometimes the vendor will offer us Sarong or Massage, kind of disturb our reaxing time at the beach, but if do not get those disturb, its really nice and relax to lay down or take a nap"
Giovanna C,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2012,"poor beach with dirty sea. In the morning, when we got up, there was a sea weed's carpet 200 mt. deep."
Jessica_guy,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2011,It is a private beach for no hawkers (well not many) and the water is beautiful and they have plenty of water sports all along the beach.
DavidSef,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2012,"This is a really beautiful beach with white sand and clear water. Everything you see in a postcard but the banks of seaweed kind of kill the ambiance. It's very shallow and you can walk out for perhaps 2km but the entire way is blocked by banks of seaweed. i think they're trying to clean it up though, at least that's what I think I saw them doing there."
BeaAkhtar,"Manchester, UK",Oct 2012,lovely clean beach white sand and clean water bars close by and staff ready to help you move your loungers at your request 
scb813,"Pittsburgh, PA",Oct 2012,"The hotels here are great and the beach itself has some beautiful views.  The sand, however, is just OK.  It's pretty gritty and not super clean.  The water is a little cool."
yolandatomasoa,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2012,"Nice view with yummi food.. We love it.. Especially my baby girl.. She loves it very much.Clean beach, great facility and the most important it's free.. What else do you expect..Spend our time almost 2 hours and we never get bored."
willgrace,lincolnshire,Sep 2012,"there are a lot of beach sellers on this beach they are licensed and you only need to say no politely and they move on, to be replaced by another one."
Sue T,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2012,Beautiful Beach clean a world class beach and safe to paddle.The full moon was out on our last night and amazing sight seeing the moon reflecting over the ocean.
macrossworks,Kuala Lumpur,Aug 2012,"It was a great beach, there is a shopping centre called discovery shopping centre. Plenty of tourists and is only less than 15mins from most of the hotels around Nusa Dua. Great sunset view from the shopping centre itself."
airicCH,"Ottawa, Canada",Sep 2012,We recommend swimming in the afternoon (during low tide). It's easier to swim and see the fish in the water. During high tide (morning) it is extremely difficult to swim against the current!
UkJaffa,"Castleford, UK",Aug 2012,"beach was too shingley, and quite a lot of reef,but beach sellars nice and polite they didn,t hassle you too much"
Swe-Nor-traveler,Hong Kong,Sep 2012,"To crowded and not as clean as other places in Bali. It is a place to come to for entertainment, but I would stay away from picking this place for my hotel. "
Rica R,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Aug 2012,"This has been my favorite beach to swim. The turquoise and clean and clear water like no other. It is good to swim at the afternoon. The waves is friendly and it is not too deep. The water is also so clear. It is also recommended for beginner surfers. If you are a beach lover, you should go to Mengiat beach."
culik333,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2012,the sand is white and very nice to take a sun-bathe on; sea is clean and clear and it's nice to swim under the sun; 
zinasj,"Seattle, WA",Aug 2012,Visited this beach because it was near our hotel. Nothing special. Stray dogs around this area. It seemed dirty. We didn't go into water.The view at Jimbaran is better.
Max M,"Milan, Italy",Aug 2012,"Really nice and quite beach, the sea is clean and there are not so many people you can find also some good place for eat "
Boy-Nellie,"Oss, The Netherlands",Jul 2012,"Along the beach there is a walking area of 5 km from Tanjun Benoa to Nusa Dua. We watched the waterblow, very high waves splashing on the rocks."
Ryan C C,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2012,"The watersports made the water oily and a bit dirty, but there were not many pushy 'salespeople' around to mar the tranquility."
Sina149,Dubai,Aug 2012,"The Beach is wonderfully nice and calming, you can walk your way through the beach and access to many hotels and resorts... It is perfect for getting a Tan or laying to relax!"
Guido B,Belgium,Aug 2012,"Nusa Dua Beach is a nice sandy beach for little feet to play in. Very shallow water and as it is protected by a reef, there is no surf or wave to endanger the little tikes either. Not many hawkers and hecklers either and at the stretch behind the Melia you have a couple of local food stalls which close at around seven(ish)"
HolidaysAllOver,Melbourne,Aug 2012,Lovely tidal beach.  Great for watersports when tide was in and the kids enjoyed hunting for crabs when tide was out.  Nice clean water.
yummy_factor,las vegas,Aug 2012,"The beach itself is pretty and clean and there aren't very many people hassling you during the day. If a guy named Nyoman offers you a coconut, TAKE IT!! he brought simple syrup, sliced limes, and ice and it was the best!"
Patricia A,United State,Jul 2012,"There are high tide differences in Bali, when the tide is out the beach is pretty ordinary. I was extremely surprised at the amount of garbage floating in the water. I spent one day at the beach and it was enough"
sunny197251,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2011,Beach was very  dirty & smelly  Beach water was Full of sea urchin . Many local people came  to the beach and burn the paper  & send paper to the sea I think that makes   ruin the sea   & beach And it was very noisy with  local music all day I really can not have peace of mind . View was not that great and no wind ... ... Extremely hot every day . Seriously you can find better beach in  Malaysia . No need to fly so far way I have no fantasy with bali . Very regret to came  here .
snah55,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2012,"The view here is breathtaking and the waters are clean. Waves can be strong and choppy though. There is water sports available here, such as para sailing."
WIlson_HK_12,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2012,The beach is clean and quiet. Secured by guards. Sand is pure white. But wave may be too big for swimming.
Jason-ASDF,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2012,"Good place to escape the otherwise chaotic island. Each resort has their own little area where they serve food and drinks, it is good quality but quite expensive for the island."
saverioca,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2012,We lost Nusa due beach because we lost the balinese atmosphere  behind the cement of the Jakarta enterprises . we lost the original dry environment 
Aggie M,Perth,Apr 2012,"We came out of curiosity as we were in the area. Our driver took us to the beach and there was a memorial garden which we walked to. The beach was rather clean and not bad considering it was open to the public. There were massage stalls and paths. The water seemed calm. I think it is a nice one to go swimming with young kids. We just walked around and then left as we were heading to Uluwatu. The area was distinctly catered to tourists and what seemed like 5-6 star hotels. The security was tighter, etc. and certain sections of the beach were closed off to the public. That quick stopover gave us a sense of what it would be like to stay in Nusa Dua, compared to Kuta/Legian."
travelwithkids2012,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Jun 2012,"The beach was golden sand but littered with seaweeds and trash. The coral was only yards from shore. We saw some life in the tide pools when the tide was out. There was hardly any wave but it's not suitable for swimming either as there was jelly fish in the water. Maybe good for sun-bathing or children to play on the beach. It is very quiet, compared to the more popular Kuta Beach."
tsfoxen,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2012,"I am probably spoiled after experiencing Thailand's paradise beaches but Nusa Dua is not anything special, at least not in front of the Conrad."
ProudlyDurbs,"Westville, South Africa",Jul 2012,The beach in front of the Grand Hyatt is not so good. By 11am the water recedes to a distance and the coral really hurt one's feet. A 20/30 minute walk to the beach on the right of the hotel provided a good swimming area. One has to find a beach that can be enjoyed for swimming!
dianeyorkshire,yorkshire,Aug 2011,Not as nice as I had hoped but the lacuna hotel lagoons more than make up for that. We also saw quite a few rats on the beach wich put us off but nothing in the hotel grounds
familyfuninsun,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2012,"Beach sand course and no surf, felt like an inner city beach"
Laujemsar,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2012,"Nice and clean, better than expected, didnt get hassled."
FayLim,37 contributions,Aug 2011,"Wonderful and amazing place to visit. It has a very beautiful beach, white sand, clean environment and was surronded by 5 stars luxury hotels. Nusa Dua Beach is not in my itinerary, but our driver brought us there. Thanks and appreciate to him, MR.Agung. We are surprised with the awesome ""waterblow"", the blue lagoon and the special geoographic area.Strongly recommend it as a must visit place. It is FOC to enter the beach and waterblow area eventhough you may not affordable to staying over there."
Branislav B,"Bratislava, Slovakia",Feb 2012,"Nusa dua is the best ...clean water, white & clear sand, fantastic resorts."
raio0611,"Osaka, Japan",Jul 2012,"Really romantic the view of the setting sun(><)It is in a beach sandal by all means!As for the rice,sea foods are unrivaled articles"
Ripple S,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2012,Private beach with no waves though. But clear waters and emerald green seaweed. Perfect for sun tanning and lazing around.
Abdulaziz A,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2012,"I can say that it is a good beach, but not the best beach in Asia , I mean it can be sandy in some area but you face some rocks and underwater plants "
zcemp13,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2012,"Whitish sands, safe for kids when the tide goes out mid way, clear waters, able to just sit there in the sea with your partner and have a lovely conversation, it's generally very clean. "
Rob E,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2012,"Even the beach at St. Regis was littered with rubbish. Went for a swim and found the following just floating near shore: a diaper, clothes hanger, drinking straw, pen cap, bottle cap, teabag, potato chip bag. Bali is not good for swimming. It's simply too filthy, and I'd say unsafe especially for children. It's a shame because the water itself is nice enough. I still swam the following day because I can't resist jumping into warm ocean but I don't recommend it for anyone worried about  their health."
David E,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2012,"There are high tide differences in Bali, when the tide is out the beach is pretty ordinary.  Plenty of hotel pools for swimming though, not sure I would swim at the beach.  "
Ray_and_Amanda,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2012,"So beautiful, but we had watched Jaws the night before, so wimped out of having anything past a shallow paddle!"
Yves t,"Maastricht, The Netherlands",May 2012,"On both sides of Nusa Dua Beach hotel are hotels that offer much better value for money. Rooms really need to be renovated...Too bad they are not keeping up with Melia, Laguna, Westin or any other hotel located close to them."
silliv,manchester,Jan 2012,"Lovely area, nice walk along the coast, good bars, restaurants and cafes available on the front but mainly along the road. cafe and comfortable to walk in day and evening. Great relaxation and place away from the more commercial parts of Bali"
peteozi,Brisbane,Jun 2012,"The beach at Nusa Dua is varied depending where you stay. We recently stayed at the Club Bali Mirage where the beach was good when the tide was in but terrible when it was out. You could actually walk 200 meters out to sea it was so low.  However, the beach in front of the Ayodya Resort was much better and you could actually swim at low tide. The pictures of the beach on some resort sites leaves a lot to the imagination and does not represent what is really there. We generally prefer the pool to the ocean as the water can be cloudy and full of seaweed."
Pohim,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jan 2012,"It is a good beach to relax under the sun with a good book but definitely not for swimming. I find the water to be ""cloudy"" and the sand so coarse. Don't expect too much or else will be disappointed. "
danewtl,"Klang, Selangor, Malaysia",Jun 2012,"Visited twice in this trip. I don't really know the exact location of the beach but the 1st day our driver took us to what seems like all the top hotel area of Nusa Dua. At the end of the road, there is beach area for us to relax whilst waiting for our wives to finish their massage. Walking along the beach, I realised that despite all the beach chairs and facilities by the hotels, the beach is actually quite dirty. Seen load of rubbish floating along the waves onto the beach. There was a bar somewhere nearby and we had our Bintang Beer at 35,000 ruppiah per glass. Can't complain on the hotel pricing. The next day, we were taken to another side of Nusa Dua where we wanted to do the Sea Walker but on arrival was told that per pax cost us USD108. I understood from the internet it cost around USD55 so there was no way we were going for it. Instead, snorkeling cost only USD25 so in order to satisfy the boys, we agreed to take up snorkeling. We were taken to a boat which took us out further to sea. On the way, it was a long sad sight to see. Rubbish on the beach and floating on the sea. Dead sea corals underneath! Not so clear waters. Is this the Great Bali Beach we came for? When we jumped out of the boat for snorkeling, the waves were incredibly strong even for an adult, and the tide keep taking us away from the boat. I had to swim afloat just to keep an eye on the boys from straying away. The snorkeling activity was for an hour but after 20 mins, we all decided we had enough and jumped onto the boat. Surprisingly, there is no ladder and not easy climbing up by stepping on the motor engine. Along the way back, plenty of sea activity... jet skies, banana boat etc. How long will this beach last until the sea becomes undesirable one day? Well, there are plenty of good beach and sea for great underwater activities and this is certainly not one of them"
hippodiver,"Hong Kong, China",May 2012,Bali's beaches are certainly not the best in Asia.
dsiemion,"Jacksonville, FL",Jun 2012,The beach was a comfortable place to relax.  There was some light attempts to sell things but not too bad.  There are a lot of nice bars and lounges along the beach owned by the resorts.  The water was very shallow (ankle high) near the coast in a few locations but with a short walk you can get to a standard coastline for better water options if desired.
hmpbpd,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Jul 2011,"This beach is really just a little rock jetty - the only part of Nusa Dua not ""owned"" by the huge hotels. Not much to do there if you're not staying at one of the mega-resorts."
Yarmm,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2011,"Not too crowd like in kuta beach, more quiet, its a great place for relaxing"
Dreamtofly,"Innsbruck, Austria",Apr 2012,"I think its the most decent,clean and beautiful beach in Bali ....White sands with amazing view from Penida Island right across !!"
Harriet M,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",Dec 2011,i loved it. its great - no negatives - go for it!!!
3LittleBeachBums,26 contributions,Apr 2012,"Go to Bali for the culture, not the beach.  There are many more beautiful beaches in South East Asia.  Nusa Dua beach was nice though."
zeroeight,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2012,Nice stretch of sand.  Too bad it faces east so we could not get the sunsets over water.  Not busy like Jimbaran Bay.
Farah A,"Manama, Bahrain",Apr 2012,"In comparison to the other beach we've been to - Kuta / Legian Beach - this beach was quieter, cleaner, and the waves were calmer.Most of the beaches are owned by the hotels / resorts, however you can walk up and down the beaches.  If you want to get yourself a long chair to relax then you need to pay a small fee to use the chairs.  If you are only visiting the beach then I recommend you get your own towel as the resorts who rent out the chairs to visitors don't provide towels.Lots of variety in terms watersports - snorkeling, diving, sailing, windsurfing, a trip to an island to see turtles, etc."
Karen K,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2012,Most of the beaches at Nusa Dua are privately owned by the resorts.  You are however allowed to walk along the beach and we even used some of the resort lounge chairs when we wanted.  The beach itself is clean but very tidal.  
bamboobaby,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2012,I was extremely surprised at the amount of garbage floating in the water.  I spent one day at the beach and it was enough.  My next day was spent poolside.  
Tom N,Darwin,Apr 2012,Plenty of sun beds and very good service if required.
Sandy-WorldTraveler,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2012,"Please see my pictures, was blessed to have crystal clear waters, white sand and cloudless skies during our recent trip to Nusa Dua (March 30th, 2012). Pictures taken outside the Novotel. Pure bliss and much cleaner comparatively to Benoa (2nd to Nusa Dua), Kegian & Kuta."
Ian M,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2012,"Beach wasnt clean! Syringes found in front of us on Westin area of beach!  So many petrol watersports, there was a 'film' of fuel on the surface.  Wouldn't swim there!"
CanadaWorldtraveller,canada,Mar 2012,"Bali has very nice beaches, but if you've been to south pacific or carribean, you will find like me that the beaches ar not that spectacular. However, very clean and well maintainted. And its always pleasant to go to the beach!"
greenfrogBrisbane,Brisbane,Mar 2012,"At high tide the beach was great, at low tide not so great.  Warm water in March which was great.Being from Queensland, we have the best beaches in the world!!!"
rogermb,UK,Apr 2011,"The hotel facilities, pools etc are superb but the beach is really poor by comparison. "
Beach Bum B,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2012,"We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard and really enjoyed the days there. The beach that their shuttle took us to was flat, sandy and very quiet. There is some decent 3-4 foot surf just off the beach, but no waves make it into the shore. The vendors are not aggressive at all and present a good selection of things to consider."
crossbordertraveller,NSW,Mar 2012,"The feel here is very relaxed. Not for the surfers, but a refreshing place to cool off, near many great restaurants and local drink shops. People here are obviously on holidays and you'll mix with locals enjoying a cool off as well. Nice beach, it would rate, even in Australia."
Caprice164,347 contributions,Mar 2012,"a bit rough, the waters be careful on some days, these are the days you will probably use the pool as most did."
GJAJ,"Chicago, IL",Mar 2012,"For those of us who don't live near an ocean, we like to go to the ocean for waves.  They have built up walls to completely shut off all waves from this beach, especiall in front of the Conrad."
BigBuddy66,"Winchester, VA",Mar 2012,The beach is not as crowded as others and is protected somewhat from currents on the end where the Melia Hotel is.   Its only waist_deep for quite a ways out.  It's not the best beach I've been to but its not bad.  The view from the shore is beautiful though.   
Marlene002,"Inverness, UK",Mar 2012,beach was brilliant very clean and very relaxing.  The restaurant was good value for money.
Nandoshu,"Sao Paulo, SP",Dec 2011,"Beach near the Golf and Country Club and the Novotel Hotel is a open beach with current, you might have a day use, good drinks and decent food. A good option to stay in Nusa Dua and enjoy a different beach."
Simply Travel and Eat,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2012,"The better beaches in Bali as most of these beaches are maintained by the international resorts located along the beach.Clean and low waves beaches as the beach should be sheltered, as we see waves from a distance but never hit the shore. The sands are soft and white. Good for children."
travelqueen15,"Philadelphia, PA",Feb 2012,Not able to really enjoy because of rocks and seaweed.  But beautiful sand. 
erijon,East Aegean,Feb 2012,When I saw Nusa Dua beach I thought that it's the sight  someone must have in mind when talking about a beach in Bali... It compares with no other popular beach on the island for me.Not the best or what I had dreamt before going to the island but certainly a well looking place.
SirkKx,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2012,"Beautiful location, nice at sunset but a lot of trash"
cam_sydney4,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2011,"Beach had (typically asian) floating rubbish, but overall not a bad beach. It's protected by a reef and had quite a high tidal range."
Nancy544,"Sydney,Australia",Jan 2012,"We love the fact that you can walk along the beach and stop at different resorts for a drink, have a look at the stalls and generally just enjoy the ambiance.  The sand could be a problem if they don't keep it off the path - not good for bikes. "
Elaini K,"Nanaimo, Canada",Jan 2012,"the massage ladys are simple the best ever, they work in atent so even if theres aquick storm you are still being pampered"
Abroadin5inchheels,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2012,Loved the water sports.  Felt safe and lots of fun.
nicthechick5,"Bundaberg, Australia",Jan 2012,"Great for Jet skiing and swimming. Altough lots of seaweed on the shore, there are always beach cleaners clearing up. Pristine and picture perfect."
cocksy,"South Yarra, Australia",Sep 2011,"It was windy,sea was choppy(could have been the day).Sand was a bit dirty.....needed someone to clear the seaweed etc for tourists"
PatriciaZA,"Jhb, South Africa",Dec 2011,Far better than Kuta beach and other busier beaches
Zydre,"Anso, Spain",Jan 2012,Very nice especially near Laguna and Nusa Dua hotel and spa. Westin is ok as well.
Chee Beng C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2011,The grill fish is good and there is a nice sunset view.
Michael W,"Los Angeles, CA",Nov 2011,"This was a bit different than Kuta beach, and would say it's great for families that are looking to get away from all of the craziness that Bali has to offer. There are less merchants on the beach trying to sell you bracelets and generally a more relaxing experience."
Catherine H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2011,"We hunted down the Nusa Dua Beach Grill at Geger Beach (which is currently being dwarfed by the construction of the Melia resort) for lunch one day.  We were picked up from our hotel by the owner and enjoyed a lovely relaxed lunch.  After lunch, we were invited to make use of the beach/loungers belonging to the Beach Grill and we went directly down to what is a really pretty part of the beach and had a swim.  There were a few others there in the cove who had also discovered this secret location, but I'm sad to say that once the monolith of a resort next door is completed, I don't think that beach (or the Beach Grill) will be the same the next time we visit.  I'm so glad we got to visit now!"
Bernie G,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2011,There is a sidewalk that runs from Ayoyda along the beach. It crosses sevral properties which is interesting and is a nice stroll away from traffic. The beach is warm and for the most part safe. Watch the flags.  
SerendipLara,Lara,Nov 2011,It was great to swim in the refreshing water. The beach was graded and cleaned daily and there was always something to see. The fact that there was a beach bar did not influence me. I think I am kidding myself 
Perth_Marie,Perth,May 2011,"Went to Nusa Dua beach during my holiday in which i stayed at the Novotel Nusa Dua.  The hotel had a beach shuttle bus that took you past the golf course and on to the beach where it was private with beach loungers set out, a lovely looking restaurant and bar.Even though the shuttle bus was packed, once onto the beach it was very relaxing and peaceful.  The ocean here was flat and kids were swimming in it, the sand was white and fine (and clean).  looking to the other side of the private 'novotel' beach was the 'St Regis' beach - but no one seemed to be there."
hairycelt,"Worthing, UK",Nov 2011,"keep free of debris and rubbish, security kept hawkers at bay"
Leighgrange,"North Beach, Australia",Mar 2011,"I love crystal clear water and some waves - Nusa Dua beach is not that, but its clean and fine for a wade in the shallows."
SiciliaC,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2011,"Nusa Dua private beach, Bali Relaxing resort private beach and Sakala"
Mumbo123,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2011,"Great beach for families as no surf, but lovely clean sand and clear water."
keentravelerEssex,"Leigh-on Sea, UK",Nov 2011,"the beach owned by our hotel is littered with plastic bags,empty satchets, toothpaste tubes,etc etcyou cannot swim without being caght up by these litter. The jet ski I was on had to stop as the blades was tangled ith plastic bag!!!shame  as the water is warm and  clear and the sand is beautiful."
Krittyc,melbourne,Oct 2011,"Because the beaches are tended to by private resorts they are combed and cleaned. There is a great open air massage place between Ayodya and the Hyatt resort grounds (near Ayodya watersports counter). Ask for Maria (numner 4), best full massage EVER!  "
Ian C,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2011,"With the tide,you cannot swim in the beach for long,and you have to pick the right time of day."
CDG115,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2011,"Not one of the prettiest beaches I've traveled too, the water had a lot of seaweed not too far out so the color wasn't great."
Ole L,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2011,"Not sure what the fuss is all about, packed with jet skis, man made boulders - not very pretty."
Indian_Traveller_9,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2011,It's a nice beach with clean and shallow watersDon't miss the surfing! The guys at the hotel have instructors who will assist youGot to complete 200 characters so oooooooooooooooooooo ooooo oooooooo oooooooooo ooooooooooooo ooooooo oooooooo oooooooo ooooooooo oooooooo ooooo ooooo ooooo oloooooooo
Claughton,"Dublin, Ireland",Nov 2011,One of the most beautiful we have ever been to. White sand (groomed daily oustide our hotel). Perfect for kids as its shallow all the way out to the edge of the reef. 
Sarah A,"London, UK",Jul 2011,The beach was large but rubbish was washed up in the mornings so it wasnt very attractive to swim in.
Peter B,"Kialla, Australia",Oct 2011,"This beach has plenty of shady trees, and the water has no surf,  is shallow and safe for toddlers. Only a few beach hawkers so you dont get hassled to much."
Morcella,"Santa Rosa, CA",Sep 2011,"We went on a glass bottom boat to snorkel.  From the hot air into the Indian Ocean it felt cold.  Then I adjusted and all was well.  The snorkeling was fine, but not the best.  Exciting non the less, hey you are in Bali.  Watching the parasailing was fun.  Just not for me, yet!"
teamcurlcurl,sydney,Oct 2011,Pretty and lively!  Not much to dislike.  Nice water temperature and clean.  Nice to stroll along the path and check out the other hotels on offer.
Manoj Poddar,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2011,"On teh beach near Grand hyatt, there were strong currents, a sudden gradient as u entered water which makes it dangerous. The beach was kind of  dirty although having ample scarce yellow sand and one staying as nusa dua as opposed to kuta-legion or seminyak often feel confined to hotel"
Melanie B,"Hillcrest, South Africa",Sep 2011,Was wonderful to walk out of our Hotel onto the Beach.  You can do anything with regards to water sports along the Beach plenty of places offering anything from Jet Ski's to canoes etc so shop around for a good price.  Lots of ladies offering Massages at cheaper prices than the Hotel - very good value for money.  Nice little shops with beverages at good prices.  You can also do a bit of shopping at the stalls along the beach.  Was lovely to see how many Weddings took place.  Only when the wind blows there is no protection.
PatsyDerby,"Derby, UK",Jul 2011,"Super beach - Melia Bali hotel - liked the relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and hospitality of Bali people.  Prices in hotel are expensive though for drinks and meals.  Excellent meals available outside hotel resorts at 'Bali Experience' short walk away - shops, restaurants, etc.  Loved the beach massage by locals - outside of the Hotel beach area. Must see the island if you are visiting here - hotel trips expensive - hire your own taxi driver/tour operator - just excellent value and a great way to get to know the locals and traditions - at your own pace, in your own time.  Would greatly recommend I Gede Suwarsana Tour Organizer."

rinoromeyn R,"Oslo, Norway",Feb 2011,"The beach in Nusa Dua is not that much fun if you are not in one of the many big resorts. The complete promenade is filled with long stretching expensive looking resorts, which own all the sunbeds. Yes, the beach is quite clean, has great yellow sand and the waters are clear and clean, but there is no atmosphere around this beach. We tried to relax between the two peninsulas, but over there you are only allowed to stay at a small lane, because the rest is owned by another resort. It is funny to drive around in Nusa Dua, because it is totally different compared to the rest of Bali. It is a secured village, all set-up for expensive tourism, with beautiful gardens etc. but it really misses a soul and you feel that during your stay on the beach. As long as you are not a rich person who enjoys all this drive only through Nusa Dua so you have seen it and than go to Pantai Geger (Geger Beach), which is on the side of Nusa Dua. That beach has a soul and great atmosphere."
