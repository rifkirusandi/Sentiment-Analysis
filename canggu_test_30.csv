Apr 2017,"Canggu beach is of black sand and stretches for some distance. You will find surfers mostly from Europe and the United States being carefree and chasing waves. Naturally, you'll also find Australians due to the proximity. As you reach the beach at the end of Jl Pantai Batau Bolong, you will find bars, cafes and restaurants serving hungry tourists and surfers. There are also surf boards for hire. The main mode of transport to get here is by scooter which can be hired almost anywhere or taxi. It is also a great spot to watch the sun set or just pop on one of the sun lounges set up by locals with their little shacks that sell beers and soft drinks and food. The lounges are free if you purchase a beverage with them.

Jan 2017,Canggu Beach is a black sand volcanic beach which makes it look a little unattractive for us Australians used to white sand and sparkling blue seas. However I found it a really good place to hang out and have conversations with fellow travellers at various bars that line the sand. These range from wildly expensive (Western priced) complete with swimming pools and lovely lounging furniture through to cheap little warnings which offer bean bags under beach umbrellas. There was a bit of surf when I was there and its possible to hire boards. I am a little reluctant to swim in south Bali ocean because of poor  sewage and a big population but lots of people were taking the plunge. It was boisterous sea so be careful if you are a weak swimmer - lots of sandbanks and turbulence. Excellent for big beach walks.,canggu black sand volcanic make look little unattractive u australian use white sand sparkle blue sea find really good place hang conversation fellow traveller various bar line sand range wildly expensive western price complete swimming pool lovely lounge furniture cheap little warning offer bean bag umbrellas bit surf possible hire board little reluctant swim south bali ocean poor sewage big population lot people take plunge boisterous sea careful weak swimmer lot sandbank turbulence excellent big walk,"{'neg': 0.134, 'neu': 0.703, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.5679}",0.5679,positive

Jul 2018,Canggu beach is a popular but unattractive stretch of sand on Bali's east coast just north of Seminyak beach.  It is black sand and not at all well-kept.  There are also far too many people for it to be all that pleasant.  Stray dogs are also a pest.The most popular stretch of beach is that in front of the various warungs and bars perched above.  Row after row of cheap beach loungers with parasols are full of people during peak season.  With all the people come rubbish which is not looked after really at all as much of the beach is a mess.The mess is made worse by dogs.  Stray and owned dogs are on the beach and their produce is a hazard that needs to be looked out for.The beach itself is black sand which can be ok but here is not fine enough to be a pleasant experience.  The waves in this part of the world are moderate but even when it did not seem that blustery it was still not possible to enter the water as warning signs were posted.  Even wading in a few yards was prohibited.Hawkers were present but were not overly persistent.  They did seem to spend too longer loitering but were not a threat.Seeing as there are much nicer spots just south in Seminyak it is not entirely clear why so many flock to Canggu beach or why it is considered to be a better spot.

Jul 2019,"Canggu was one of favorite places in the whole world! I had read tons and tons of forums trying to figured out which beach town  I wanted to go to and finally decided on Canggu.  I could not imagine going anywhere else now!! It was the perfect place if you're a young professional looking for a bit of night life without the party scene.  Everywhere felt new, clean, and the perfect mix of boho/Balinese culture.  We stayed in an Air BnB right off the main drive but in a fairly quiet space and it was PERFECT.  Walking distance to the beach, Love Anchor, Crate Cafe, and any restaurant or happy hour you could desire.  We moved locations half way through our trip to another city and actually took a taxi back to Canggu on our last day because we just couldn't get enough!

Oct 2018,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to Canggu Beach. There are cool local shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. The beach is wide, not overly busy and great for surfing. A really great place to hang out for a day and into the evening and watch the sunset. Our only complaint about Canggu and the other busy tourist areas in this part of Bali is the  “taxi mafia”. We were followed all the way down the very long main road when I said I wouldn’t pay for the massively overpriced “local taxis” fees. A scooter literally followed us and threw us out of the Bluebird taxi that stopped for us! Simply because they expect tourists to pay more than locals and get quite aggressive when you don’t. Despite being a really great town and resort I would’ve go back for that reason alone. These thugs attitude marred what was otherwise a great two weeks in Bali. The people are generally really lovely which is why this aggressive behaviour came as such a surprise. The police or local businesses should really do something about this abuse of tourists. I expect to pay extra for things in these areas, but I don’t expect to be hassled if I chose not too!",thoroughly enjoy visit canggu cool local shop bar restaurant cafes wide overly busy great surf really great place hang day even watch sunset complaint canggu busy tourist area part bali taxi mafia follow way long main road say wouldnt pay massively overprice local taxi fee scooter literally follow u throw u bluebird taxi stop u simply expect tourist pay local quite aggressive dont despite really great town resort wouldve go back reason alone thugs attitude mar great two week bali people generally really lovely aggressive behaviour come surprise police local business really something abuse tourist expect pay extra thing area dont expect hassle chose,"{'neg': 0.112, 'neu': 0.642, 'pos': 0.246, 'compound': 0.9559}",0.9559,positive

There were a lot of surfers about, and speaking of the water, the thing that makes it a good surf spot - strong waves - means you really must be careful if you venture out into the water for a swim. (We didn't - just meandered down the beach with our toes in the surf that came up.) There's not a lot of cover for those of us that might need some shade, so if the equatorial sun isn't your thing make sure you have sunblock and/or an umbrella. (Those might be advisable generally.)

Oct 2012,"We spent a day at Echo Beach, a short drive from Canggu, and an hour and a half from Ubud, where we were staying. The beach is not Bali's prettiest, nor its cleanest, but it does have decent surf for beginner to intermediate surfers, and is laid back enough to be enjoyable for a day trip. We had our 3 children, ages 7, 7, and 10, with us. They took a 2-hour lesson with the Canggu Surf School, which was well worth the money ($60 p.p. for 2 hours). The beach has a single alley with a few shops, and a handful of restaurants, so don't visit expecting the full-on, Bali tourist experience. In my opinion, this is a GOOD thing! The people who come here seem to be more relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak, and the lack of in-your-face commercialism is refreshing. I suspect the area was nicer a few years ago, before rampant development got underway. Right now, there's an enormous hotel going up, as well as a large number of apartments, and it detracts from the overall ""undiscovered"" vibe of the place. Probably has another year or so before it succumbs to the unzoned, unplanned development chaos that has subsumed a lot of Bali. Two unexpected high points: (1) The Echo Beach cafe, nearest to the temple, has a sensational BBQ every night. Worth staying past dark for! (2) If you like motorcycle/surf culture, the Deus Ex Machina Temple of Enthusiasm is just down the road.",spent day echo short drive canggu hour half ubud stay bali pretty cleanest decent surf beginner intermediate surfer lay back enough enjoyable day trip 3 child age 7 7 10 u take 2hour lesson canggu surf school well worth money 60 pp 2 hour single alley shop handful restaurant dont visit expect fullon bali tourist experience opinion good thing people come seem relaxed kuta seminyak lack inyourface commercialism refresh suspect area nicer year ago rampant development get underway right now theres enormous hotel go well large number apartment detract overall undiscovered vibe place probably another year succumbs unzoned unplanned development chaos subsume lot bali two unexpected high point 1 echo cafe near temple sensational bbq every night worth stay past dark 2 motorcyclesurf culture deus ex machina temple enthusiasm road,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9442}",0.9442,positive
