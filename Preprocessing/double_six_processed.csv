blackeldo,19-Jun,"A NEW NAME AND APPEARANCE FOR AN OLD SPOT….­I first visited in the early 80s – stayed here in 2015 – and checked it out annually since.A NEW NAME - this 500m section of the 9km KUTA to CANGGU beach strip has only been referred to as DOUBLE SIX BEACH these past few years.Prior, it was simply that section where LEGIAN BCH changes to SEMINYAK BCH – abt 3km from the KUTA end. Makes sense: the huge DOUBLE SIX RESORT was not opened until AUG. ‘14.A NEW APPEARANCE – I used to cycle KUTA-CANGGU beach in the 80s. Back then, the busy hotel strip would start to peter out in LEGIAN – by the time I got to the D6 area there was nothing much in back of the beach – just the occasional resort accessed by tracks down from JL LEGIAN inland. How things have changed – continuous resorts now extend past D6 to north of SEMINYAK.So D6 BEACH has changed, but what is it like? Well it’s one of the more popular stretches of sand along this busy strip - because of GOOD ACCESS (Jalan  Arjuna hits the beach here from inland LEGIAN/STH SEMINYAK which have dozens of resorts covering all budgets - and the FABULOUS BEACH CLUBS with their on-sand soft cushions and little tables mentioned in many other reviews. The place is certainly attractive, with lotsa sunlounges for rent and those multi-coloured umbrellas. South of the beach clubs are a host of those local guys selling beer – buy from them and you get the plastic chair and table, usually an umbrella and are their friend for life. They often rent sunlounges, surfboards etcMY RATING Normally I would rate D6 Beach ABOVE AVERAGE but for one demerit – the open drain that runs below JL ARJUNA exits across the beach: dry season sees just a trickle but wet season can be a torrent.TIPS – wet season is not the best time to visit the whole extended beach – lotsa rubbish and storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).- those beach clubs: at least 3 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw the northern-most with at least 1000 people on the sand! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value but too many people for me – I went back to the beer guys.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems mid-range to high end. Dozens of places covering all budgets within a 10 min stroll inland via JL ARJUNA.- JL ARJUNA and others similarly have dozens of restaurants from sub-budget up. Wandering food halwkers on the sand can provide some inexpensive yummy stuff as does the guy doing roasted corn foot of ARJUNA.- no shortage of RETAIL THERAPY on ARJUNA and along JL LEGIAN 800M inland (latter has some of BALI’s better boutiques and furniture/art)- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand.

Lots of hawkers but a firm no goes a long way if you dont want to be bothered , then again you may want to barter for a sarong , jewellery , statue , painting , kite , etc as its all fun on the beach . Drinks at sunset on the beach is always a fantastic experience and Sundays is especially crowded with Indonesian families and groups going to the beach to relax or have fun , maybe a game of soccer or a swim , or just a walk along the waters edge .

Emille B,18-May,"We went to Double Six Beach for the sunset.  We were excited to spend our last evening in Bali watching the sun fall beneath the horizon.  As with all things in the Kuta area, shops outnumber everything but the stray dogs.  Just know, if you go by foot, you'll have to say ""no"" about a hundred times.  However, the biggest disappointment was how the natural beauty of this beach and those waves were spoiled by the trash and general lack of cleanliness.  That's what really hurts, because we've been around the world before and seen high traffic areas and never seen a beach that had such natural beauty so spoiled by man-made, preventable debris.  It was just everywhere and overwhelmed our opportunity to be in the moment.  Though the clouds obscured our direct view, we wanted to stay in the moment, but surrounded as we were by the trash, it was hard to engage fully.  Even as we went to a bar to sit and have a cocktail, the uncleanliness just followed through.  The beach chairs were stained terribly, if I were a business owner, I'd offer a towel to patrons who would like one, I know we would have used it (the stains were irrespective of the beach bar, which were often placed right on the sand).  We left Bali a bit disappointed that they haven't managed their naturally beautiful space carefully, leaving it to tourists, vendors and stray dogs to manage the trash instead of making an effort to keep the area pristine. PS:  the waves are absolutely beautiful, if you want to surf or splash, I see no reason not to here.","We went to Double Six Beach for the sunset.

Daughters got their braids done for $15 for long hair which was way cheaper than anywhere else and, in my opinion, more memorable for them. We had pedicures and bought souvenirs. Rented a tent but was charged the full day price even though he cleared up an hour after we arrived at 3.30pm. He just laughed at me and said, per hour price so be clear! We didn't get upset, it's one of those things! One night we had dinner st the beach and it was a magical experience. We sat on bean bags around the table as the sun set and the musicians set up. We danced, laughed, talked and ate. Seven of us and it cost around $70 AUD. we didn't let the kids swim at night of course. Renting surfboards was easy, arranging surf lessons was easy. Everyone is geared up for Aussie families. Plenty of pubs around the place. Good cheap breakfasts. ","We actually visited sept 2016 but can't go back that far.

Spesh7,17-Jul,"We found Paradise ! Absolutely loved every minute of the stay. It was 5 days of bliss ! We got upgraded as it was our honeymoon and we just kived the room ! The balcony was long enough to have and train a football team ha. We also had complimentary drinks and honeymoon welcome upon arrival. It couldn't be anymore professional than it was set up. The bathroom with a tv attached right in front of the bath tub. The shower in both forms shower head and over head tropical fall. The staff so pleasant and ok its part of the job but it just felt more organic than forced. We were late to the pool a few mornings and worried about no sun lounges but the pool and lagoon staff always found room for us. This was a big plus for my new wife as she loves the sun. It would be a disservice to name individuals because every one made the stay so pleasant for us. We dine on the rooftop on day one and the view is something to behold, the view especially at sunset is magical. Plus the food was really good and reasonable compared to irish prices anyway. On our last night we visited the plantation grill bar in the hotel, we stepped in the elevator and stepped out in 1922 New York. It was like the old time Jazz Bars from New York movies. The ambiance, the food, the music, the conpany and the drinks were all top class 5 star rating. A little pricey but well worth the quality. I must mention ""Koma"" our waiter , smiling from ear to ear and when he heard it was our honeymoon well he brought out a plate with happy honeymoon and some specialist chocolates, classy touch. A great guy with great manners and welcoming approach. When we were checking out it all became very real that our stay was our with Double six Bali. Id struggle to say ive been anywhere with better service. We are sad to be leaving here and will hopefully make a return in some years to come as it was just a holistic, spiritual and all round bloody amazing honeymoon !Thank you Audrey and James Claffey ","We found Paradise !

sandcall,17-Jan,"My partner & I recently returned from Bali. As I'm a beach lover, while on our trip away, decided to go to the beach. I was totally shocked. There was litter everywhere, from plastic bottles, to rubbish, diapers & everything else. The water even had a oily surface as well.

AndyS,16-May,"Pros: Good waves, fairly clean, many restaurants and cafes for meals.Cons: No place to leave your belongings (lockers)I was told Double Six had strong waves great for surfing. Only problem was i don't surf. But i can swim (or so i'm told) so the strong waves are good fun to splash around in. The beach is well maintained so it's clean. Unless you ended up at a sorry spot where it does get quite stinky so just walk around, it's quite a big beach.

He wanted 50000 for two hours which is more than the daily rate.  I told him I was not impressed and he said, ok, go somewhere else.   We did.  My daughters also got their hair braided on the beach.

chris-bailey-sydney,16-Aug,"What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple. On this occasion, there are a few kids or all ages, but mostly coupes and small groups of men and women is their early 30's. It's quiet, classy and relaxed with EVERYTHING you could ever want at your fingertips.  10/10 for Double Six.  Chris and Kev ","What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple.

piku1980,15-Oct,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable.","This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak.

The Double6 beach is much much cleaner and the restaurants on the beach are quite nice, nothing great but just nice.

keshia w,15-Sep,"Went there every morning for 3 days to play in the waves, get a tan and body board. The beach is dotted with colourful beach chairs and umbrellas that can be 'rented'. You just need to order a drink or two. My boyfriend and I ordered a coke and a bintang beer for SGD14 (pretty extravagant but we took it as rental for the chairs) and that entitled us to use their chairs for the whole day. We also rented 2 body boards for SGD10 for whole day use. Double six beach was away from the busy Kuta area, but can still get pretty crowded on the weekend. The waves here can get quite big and the under current can also get quite strong. Would suggest that parents keep their children close and in sight at all times. There were some points where I almost fell due to the strong under current. There were peddlers approaching us to purchase things from them, but once you say no they won't bother you so much. Or you could also close your eyes and pretend to sleep when you see them approaching your direction. All in all, this is a great place to rest, relax, people watch and learn surfing if you're up for it. It costs about SGD30 for 1.5 hours lesson.","Went there every morning for 3 days to play in the waves, get a tan and body board.

Bryan R,15-Jul,I recently stayed at a hotel close to the beach and went to the beach each day.The beach had swimming flags which a lot of swimmers swan between.The problem was that lots of surfers also kept moving into the area making it very unsafe for the swimmers due to the surf boards frequently nearly hitting the swimmers.After seeing many near misses I approached the surf life savers they said the current was pulling the surfers along the beach so there is nothing they could do. I pointed out that the flags are there for swimmer safety and the surfers should not be in the area under any circumstances and besides they had all of the rest of the beach to surf. The life savers answer was to remove the swimming flags and put up no swimming signs - not a satisfactory outcome.  For the rest of my stay (9 days) the flags were not put back out.

Clive G,15-Jun,"Double Six Beach is located between Legian and Seminyak. I guess about a kilometre strip of beach. During the day it is the same as any other beach but toward sunset and into the evening the place begins to buzz. There are numerous bars along the beach each offering some sort of seating, food and drinks and live music. All at inflated prices with plus plus to cap off the price. BUT if you go you are there for a sunset and balmy evening on the beach. Best advice I can give is to monitor your bill as it can too easy get out of hand. Food is at best ordinary.  If you choose to swim be aware there are quite large waves (Dumpers) which form in very shallow water. Be aware of the rips that form quickly and the odd idiot on a surf board out of control.

Megan S,14-Nov,"I quite liked Double Six Beach. It was a bit grubby with a bit of litter around etc but still a nice place to hang out, particularly at night. I hired an umbrella lounge for $5 and was soon approached by one of the many massage ladies who sell along the beach. They sell bracelets, sarongs, do manicures, massages, you name it, they do it. I had a great massage by a lovely older lady. She was very nice and it was a good massage. I paid about $13 Australian i guess which is probably more than the going rate for a beach massage, but i thought she was worth it. Bit annoying to have other ladies come and try to sell you things when you clearly have your eyes closed in the middle of a massage, i just tried to ignore them without being rude. Often they would go and get a little child to come back with them to see if that improved their sales tactics. If there was something i wanted to buy i would not have minded but how many sarongs and bracelets can you buy in bali??? This beach cafes etc were not really open during the lead up to Nyepi Day so we only got to go down there our last night. La Plancha was very popular with all the umbrellas and bean bags on the beach. We decided to go to the little place one up from them, i think it was called the Juice Park or something like that. Bean bags, not as busy and cheap drinks, we were very happy to hang out there and would certainly go back. Much quieter than La Plancha and we even had a foot massage on the bean bags, how cool is that. We stayed at the gorgeous Double Six Resort but next time would not waste my time drinking at their rooftop bar or their expensive pool area. At $16 for a very average cocktail i would rather drink cheap drinks on a bean bag on the beach any time. Especially with someone massaging my feet! Doesnt get any better than that in Bali!

Phase N,14-Dec,"The beaches of Bali are are awful. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourist come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are pristine paradise.p so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc.  I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer.  This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built  over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person.  All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.   These bars also seem to be populated with pretentious people staring at their smart devices and taking selfies particularly 'la  Plancha'.  You're better off buying some bin tangs and go further up where there are no bars and enjoy the sunset on a towel with some quiet.","The beaches of Bali are are awful.

Giboos,14-Dec,"My husband and I met up with some friends of ours for a night at the Double Six Rooftop Bar.What struck me was that we were asked before being advised of directions to where the bar was located what our names were, as though there was a door list (which there was not) and the bar was barely half full.The cocktails are super expensive and are no where near as good as others I have tried, Potato Head's cocktail list is much more extensive and better executed.The clincher was the food....My husband and I ordered the ""Big A$% Bucked of Chicken Wings"" which mentioned on the menu that it would be enough for 3 people at least - we are NOT huge eaters and what we received was a ""Big A$% Bucked of White Rice"" with some chicken wings on top - this was not good enough in my opinion.Service was slow - the waitress had to be chased down at times so we could order.I can see what type of ambiance that is being attempted here at the Double Six Roof Top bar but it is not been executed well at all.Food and beverage needs some work and service needs tidying up.Also nothing is more off putting that trying to fake elitism with pretending to have a door list when one does not exist - people don't want to put up with this kind of pretentious rubbish when they are on holidays - in fact no one should have to put up with it ever.Sorry to say but we are heading back to Bali in

It is patrolled by trained lifeguards and has sweet ladies to massage you for about R50.000 to R80.000 of course they will ask much more. We like to rent the little lounges with umbrella's and then eat across from the Beach at The Blue Ocean Cafe where my fav is the Blue Ocean Salad and the pasta dishes but the seafood is also fantastic.

Lily A,13-Sep,"As far as beaches go Double 6 beach is a true Bali experience in itself. The sunbed guys will try and rip you off by saying 2 beds are 80,000 when you can get them for 50,000. Then once you've actually settled on your sunbeds which granted are very comfy, half of the hawkers in Bali will descend on you and offer you anything from tattoos to pedicures to ice-creams (he was actually a favourite). Even pretending to be asleep doesn't work! We are pretty laid back so it didn't bother us too much but when two balinese families set up camp behind our sunbeds and kept knocking into them we were starting to wonder if we were on Punk'd. The beach itself isn't that pretty but I could people watch all day and there are plenty of beach dining and bar options if sun bathing gets a bit too much. The sea is great for surfing not so much for swimming but there are a few guys offering surfing lessons along the beach if you want to try it.","As far as beaches go Double 6 beach is a true Bali experience in itself.

This area seems better suited to younger patrons who like to party on the beach. The beach itself was not clean and at various points sewage water came into the ocean from the land.

Liverpool051,13-Jun,"A massive and very busy beach. Sand was nice, and sea is shallow and water is clean.  Good to learn to surf. My 8 yr old and husband paid $50 (US) for a 90 min lesson. Make sure you stay in the yellow and red flags though as it can be dangerous.  There was a report in the paper of a tourist drowning this week.  We paid 270 rup for 3 beds and drinks all day ( beer and water) and 2 surf boards too.  This was at the far end of the beach where the vendor has Bob Marley decor.  I think it's called One Love.  The constant sellers of silver tat, bracelets, CD,s, DVD,s, magazines and fruit are very annoying when they do not take no for an answer. I did not like about 5 of them gathering around my bed and not moving. I found the best way to not get hassled was to wear sunglasses and a hat and pretend they did not exist.  It's a pity there are so many wild dogs roaming around too.  I know some of them may be rabid, which made me fear for my children's life - literally.  But they just poo on the beach and no one clears it ( or any other litter up).  I would have happily paid the seller's to pick up the poo and tidy the beach, instead of trying to sell me tat.

But it's a nice place to stroll around the beach and hear the waves.There are some warungs around the area too, where you can get some food.  And there are a couple of bars just off the street parallel to the beach, if you dig the night life.You can see locals selling their wares, but they are not pushy as I've read about.  They sell jewelries, watches, kites.  The kites were actually quite nice and intricate, I saw one they were flying which was a pirate ship with many sails.  Actually I was just walking along, they offered 200,000 at first then even without any reaction from me except a smile, they lowered it to 100,000.  I figured I could get it for 50,000 if I haggled, haha!  But I didn't intend to buy it since it was too difficult to bring home anyway.The sand is ok, but it's brown.

I don't mind the brown/black sand as long as the beach is clean.

actually quite nice and intricate, i saw one they were flying which was a pirate ship with many sails.  actually i was just walking along, they offered 200,000 at first then even without any reaction from me except a smile, they lowered it to 100,000.  i figured i could get it for 50,000 if i haggled, haha!  but i didn't intend to buy it since it was too difficult to bring home anyway.the sand is ok, but it's brown.  there are also some garbage along the beach, plus patches of them along the sides, which is really a waste of the beauty of the beach.  i don't mind the brown/black sand as long as the beach is clean.  my friend told me kuta beach is even worse.in the evening, you can see a lot of local folks who have come to enjoy the beach.i was excited to see the sunset, unfortunately, it was raining that day, so i missed it.  instead, i had a walk under the rain with my umbrella on the pathway just parallel to the beach, which was also nice ;-",legian beach where double six beach is is actually a middle point between kuta beach and seminyak beach  double six is just near the edge of legian and start of seminyakin terms of crowd you can see less of a crowd here than kuta beach although you can still see lots of umbrella lounges for you to sit and enjoy the beach  there are quite a number of surf schools here so you can see some beginners trying to learn to surf  this area
