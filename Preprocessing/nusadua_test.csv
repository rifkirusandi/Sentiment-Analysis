Fine white sand, a nice long & curving bay to the beach, never crowded (there is a security barrier to the entrance) and with a lot fewer sales people at hand. The water is calm, no surfing waves here, blue and warm most of the year. The bottom of the sea along the beach is rocky, so tread with care - or wear appropriate water shoes. Swimming is possible when the tide is right and you can get a couple of hours of warm, calm swimming in this delightful place. The beach itself is very long and you can go for romantic walks for at least a couple of kilometres. There are many 5* hotels along the beach, but they are recessed quite a distance away, so not intrusive at all.
