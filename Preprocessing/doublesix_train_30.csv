Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are are awful. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourist come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are pristine paradise.p so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc.  I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer.  This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built  over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person.  All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.

May 2018,"We went to Double Six Beach for the sunset.  We were excited to spend our last evening in Bali watching the sun fall beneath the horizon.  As with all things in the Kuta area, shops outnumber everything but the stray dogs.  Just know, if you go by foot, you'll have to say ""no"" about a hundred times.  However, the biggest disappointment was how the natural beauty of this beach and those waves were spoiled by the trash and general lack of cleanliness.  That's what really hurts, because we've been around the world before and seen high traffic areas and never seen a beach that had such natural beauty so spoiled by man-made, preventable debris.  It was just everywhere and overwhelmed our opportunity to be in the moment.  Though the clouds obscured our direct view, we wanted to stay in the moment, but surrounded as we were by the trash, it was hard to engage fully.  Even as we went to a bar to sit and have a cocktail, the uncleanliness just followed through.  The beach chairs were stained terribly, if I were a business owner, I'd offer a towel to patrons who would like one, I know we would have used it (the stains were irrespective of the beach bar, which were often placed right on the sand).  We left Bali a bit disappointed that they haven't managed their naturally beautiful space carefully, leaving it to tourists, vendors and stray dogs to manage the trash instead of making an effort to keep the area pristine. PS:  the waves are absolutely beautiful, if you want to surf or splash, I see no reason not to here.",go double six sunset excite spend last evening bali watch sun fall beneath horizon thing kuta area shop outnumber everything stray dog know go foot youll say hundred time big disappointment natural beauty wave spoil trash general lack cleanliness thats really hurt weve around world see high traffic area never see natural beauty spoil manmade preventable debris everywhere overwhelmed opportunity moment though cloud obscure direct view want stay moment surround trash hard engage fully even go bar sit cocktail uncleanliness follow chair stain terribly business owner id offer towel patron one know use stain irrespective bar often place right sand leave bali bit disappointed havent manage naturally beautiful space carefully leave tourist vendor stray dog manage trash instead make effort keep area pristine p wave absolutely beautiful want surf splash see reason,"{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.678, 'pos': 0.161, 'compound': -0.2228}",-0.2228,negative

Mar 2015,"I quite liked Double Six Beach. It was a bit grubby with a bit of litter around etc but still a nice place to hang out, particularly at night. I hired an umbrella lounge for $5 and was soon approached by one of the many massage ladies who sell along the beach. They sell bracelets, sarongs, do manicures, massages, you name it, they do it. I had a great massage by a lovely older lady. She was very nice and it was a good massage. I paid about $13 Australian i guess which is probably more than the going rate for a beach massage, but i thought she was worth it. Bit annoying to have other ladies come and try to sell you things when you clearly have your eyes closed in the middle of a massage, i just tried to ignore them without being rude. Often they would go and get a little child to come back with them to see if that improved their sales tactics. If there was something i wanted to buy i would not have minded but how many sarongs and bracelets can you buy in bali??? This beach cafes etc were not really open during the lead up to Nyepi Day so we only got to go down there our last night. La Plancha was very popular with all the umbrellas and bean bags on the beach. We decided to go to the little place one up from them, i think it was called the Juice Park or something like that. Bean bags, not as busy and cheap drinks, we were very happy to hang out there and would certainly go back. Much quieter than La Plancha and we even had a foot massage on the bean bags, how cool is that. We stayed at the gorgeous Double Six Resort but next time would not waste my time drinking at their rooftop bar or their expensive pool area. At $16 for a very average cocktail i would rather drink cheap drinks on a bean bag on the beach any time. Especially with someone massaging my feet! Doesnt get any better than that in Bali!

Aug 2016,"What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple. On this occasion, there are a few kids or all ages, but mostly coupes and small groups of men and women is their early 30's. It's quiet, classy and relaxed with EVERYTHING you could ever want at your fingertips.  10/10 for Double Six.

Oct 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable.",time manage stretch normal weekend best possible extent bali tripwe want go south bali last trip part asia serene mountainsvolcanic lake monkey forestsouth bali fabulous beach start seminyaklegian way south kutawe choose stay pearl hotel double six road hardly 10 minute walk distance happen place south baliwe take early flight friday afternoon reach eveninganthonywho owner pearl hotel make arrangement pick airportit take 30 min reach boutique hotel dump bags hotel room head double six beachthere plenty shack live music bean bag sand little colourful umbrellasthe sand beautiful set right local band playingwe enjoy good nacho satay along free flow drink music balinese jennifer lopeznight well spent retire hotelthis place quiet nice pool midst private room amenitiesafter breakfast saturday morning back strollingwalking past huge surf wave create misty environmentthere couch one rent 10 per hourwe treat double couch enjoy breeze facesbeautiful view amy tan save fish drowningwe lazy lay back lunch hotel oberoi trendy dj play delicious cocktail taste life relentless wave continue crush create beautiful rhythm sit sip refresh cocktail fresh thin crust wooden pizzathe even well spent watch beautiful sunset experiencedhopping cafesfloating paper lanterns watch fire dance beachwe explore laplancha sand timenow entire sunday spent per whim spent bit differently pamper authentic balinese massage follow lunch famous mehraputti happen street semninyak one cant resist shopping walk past best shopping boutiqueswatched breathtaking sunset hotel oberoi loungeone make advance book place becomes crowd sun set beach legian view cherish lifefinally head potato head poolside dinnerboth potato head mehraputti exquisite din experience one must south baliwe morning flight catch monday thus end plan one best backpacker tour indonesianot forget pearl arrange taxi right time wee hour even though reception close professionalism much appreciate make stay smooth memorable,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.9968}",0.9968,positive

Jul 2017,"We found Paradise ! Absolutely loved every minute of the stay. It was 5 days of bliss ! We got upgraded as it was our honeymoon and we just kived the room ! The balcony was long enough to have and train a football team ha. We also had complimentary drinks and honeymoon welcome upon arrival. It couldn't be anymore professional than it was set up. The bathroom with a tv attached right in front of the bath tub. The shower in both forms shower head and over head tropical fall. The staff so pleasant and ok its part of the job but it just felt more organic than forced. We were late to the pool a few mornings and worried about no sun lounges but the pool and lagoon staff always found room for us. This was a big plus for my new wife as she loves the sun. It would be a disservice to name individuals because every one made the stay so pleasant for us. We dine on the rooftop on day one and the view is something to behold, the view especially at sunset is magical. Plus the food was really good and reasonable compared to irish prices anyway. On our last night we visited the plantation grill bar in the hotel, we stepped in the elevator and stepped out in 1922 New York. It was like the old time Jazz Bars from New York movies. The ambiance, the food, the music, the conpany and the drinks were all top class 5 star rating. A little pricey but well worth the quality. I must mention ""Koma"" our waiter , smiling from ear to ear and when he heard it was our honeymoon well he brought out a plate with happy honeymoon and some specialist chocolates, classy touch. A great guy with great manners and welcoming approach. When we were checking out it all became very real that our stay was our with Double six Bali. Id struggle to say ive been anywhere with better service. We are sad to be leaving here and will hopefully make a return in some years to come as it was just a holistic, spiritual and all round bloody amazing honeymoon !Thank you Audrey and James Claffey ",find paradise absolutely love every minute stay 5 day bliss get upgraded honeymoon kived room balcony long enough train football team ha complimentary drink honeymoon welcome upon arrival couldnt anymore professional set bathroom tv attach right front bath tub shower form shower head head tropical fall staff pleasant ok part job felt organic force late pool morning worry sun lounge pool lagoon staff always find room u big plus new wife love sun disservice name individual every one make stay pleasant u dine rooftop day one view something behold view especially sunset magical plus food really good reasonable compare irish price anyway last night visit plantation grill bar hotel step elevator step 1922 new york old time jazz bar new york movie ambiance food music conpany drink top class 5 star rating little pricey well worth quality must mention koma waiter smile ear ear heard honeymoon well bring plate happy honeymoon specialist chocolates classy touch great guy great manner welcome approach checking become real stay double six bali id struggle say ive anywhere well service sad leave will hopefully make return year come holistic spiritual round bloody amaze honeymoon thank audrey james claffey,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.645, 'pos': 0.305, 'compound': 0.9959}",0.9959,positive

Jun 2019,"A NEW NAME AND APPEARANCE FOR AN OLD SPOT….­I first visited in the early 80s – stayed here in 2015 – and checked it out annually since.A NEW NAME - this 500m section of the 9km KUTA to CANGGU beach strip has only been referred to as DOUBLE SIX BEACH these past few years.Prior, it was simply that section where LEGIAN BCH changes to SEMINYAK BCH – abt 3km from the KUTA end. Makes sense: the huge DOUBLE SIX RESORT was not opened until AUG. ‘14.A NEW APPEARANCE – I used to cycle KUTA-CANGGU beach in the 80s. Back then, the busy hotel strip would start to peter out in LEGIAN – by the time I got to the D6 area there was nothing much in back of the beach – just the occasional resort accessed by tracks down from JL LEGIAN inland. How things have changed – continuous resorts now extend past D6 to north of SEMINYAK.So D6 BEACH has changed, but what is it like? Well it’s one of the more popular stretches of sand along this busy strip - because of GOOD ACCESS (Jalan  Arjuna hits the beach here from inland LEGIAN/STH SEMINYAK which have dozens of resorts covering all budgets - and the FABULOUS BEACH CLUBS with their on-sand soft cushions and little tables mentioned in many other reviews. The place is certainly attractive, with lotsa sunlounges for rent and those multi-coloured umbrellas. South of the beach clubs are a host of those local guys selling beer – buy from them and you get the plastic chair and table, usually an umbrella and are their friend for life. They often rent sunlounges, surfboards etcMY RATING Normally I would rate D6 Beach ABOVE AVERAGE but for one demerit – the open drain that runs below JL ARJUNA exits across the beach: dry season sees just a trickle but wet season can be a torrent.TIPS – wet season is not the best time to visit the whole extended beach – lotsa rubbish and storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).- those beach clubs: at least 3 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw the northern-most with at least 1000 people on the sand! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value but too many people for me – I went back to the beer guys.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems mid-range to high end. Dozens of places covering all budgets within a 10 min stroll inland via JL ARJUNA.- JL ARJUNA and others similarly have dozens of restaurants from sub-budget up. Wandering food halwkers on the sand can provide some inexpensive yummy stuff as does the guy doing roasted corn foot of ARJUNA.- no shortage of RETAIL THERAPY on ARJUNA and along JL LEGIAN 800M inland (latter has some of BALI’s better boutiques and furniture/art)- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand.

I pointed out that the flags are there for swimmer safety and the surfers should not be in the area under any circumstances and besides they had all of the rest of the beach to surf. The life savers answer was to remove the swimming flags and put up no swimming signs - not a satisfactory outcome.  For the rest of my stay (9 days) the flags were not put back out. It seems that the surfers have all the rights and to bad for swimmers.I love the Bali beaches its just a pity safety isn't taken a little more seriously but I suppose that's Bali for you.,recently stay hotel close go daythe swimming flag lot swimmer swan betweenthe problem lot surfer keep move area make unsafe swimmer due surf board frequently nearly hit swimmersafter see many near miss approach surf life saver say current pulling surfer along nothing point flag swimmer safety surfer area circumstance besides rest surf life saver answer remove swimming flag put swim sign satisfactory outcome rest stay 9 day flag put back seem surfer right bad swimmersi love bali beach pity safety isnt take little seriously suppose thats bali,"{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.5575}",0.5575,positive

We paid 270 rup for 3 beds and drinks all day ( beer and water) and 2 surf boards too.  This was at the far end of the beach where the vendor has Bob Marley decor.  I think it's called One Love.  The constant sellers of silver tat, bracelets, CD,s, DVD,s, magazines and fruit are very annoying when they do not take no for an answer. I did not like about 5 of them gathering around my bed and not moving. I found the best way to not get hassled was to wear sunglasses and a hat and pretend they did not exist.  It's a pity there are so many wild dogs roaming around too.  I know some of them may be rabid, which made me fear for my children's life - literally.

Apr 2013,double six was the first beach we went to during our stay in Bali. it was a short taxi ride from where we were staying in Seminyak. upon arriving we notices the sewage smell right away. it was not goody. we walked as far as we could down the beach away from the smell. it was easy and cheap to find chairs. i even rented a boogie board for 3 bucks. the waves were amazing and we had plenty of fun! its not the cleanest beach along this coast but for one day it wasnt bad. there are little cafes and restaurants all around and some good shopping too!,double six first go stay bali short taxi ride stay seminyak upon arrive notice sewage smell right away goody walk far away smell easy cheap find chair even rent boogie board 3 buck wave amaze plenty fun cleanest along coast one day wasnt bad little cafe restaurant around good shopping,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.74, 'pos': 0.26, 'compound': 0.9377}",0.9377,positive

Jan 2017,"I have never been so shocked at the state of a beach. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's covered in litter! It's all washed up along the sand down the whole stretch of the beach, even as you walk ankle deep in the water rubbish brushes past and on your feet - disgusting! There's even a huge digger regularly driving by with entire loads of rubbish back and forth trying to clear it. It's shocking! The colour of the sand is grey, not surprisingly. And the water is literally brown, when the waves break and it should be white froth it's actually brown froth. It's vile, and shockingly unhygienic. I'd be genuinely concerned to swim it... certainly not with broken skin or cuts. It's so clearly dirty, don't risk it. Sadly the beach itself with this view and surroundings is nowhere to relax either.  The worst beach I've ever seen. How sad to see what we're all going to the planet. Maybe go see it for yourself as it's quite harrowing, but absolutely not somewhere to go for vacation or to relax/enjoy.
