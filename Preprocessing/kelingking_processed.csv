Mariana Lucas,Jul-19,"One of the best spots in Nusa Penida. Amazing views, make sure to get there early. Luckily we got there around 10 am and there was no queue, only a few people walking up and down. Make sure to take some comfortable shoes. We took flip flops and we had to be very careful. If you are looking to go all the way down to the beach it will take you around 30/40 minutes so be prepared for the time of your life. The stairs going down are very narrow and you have to watch your step. The stairs are pretty crowded with people coming up and going down. If you are afraid of heights or if you don't have good balance I wouldn't recommend. This does require some level of fitness but once you get down, you will encounter the most amazing sand. Just watch out for the waves as they are very strong and they can pull you in. I would not recommend swimming in these waters. Perfect place for those Instagram pics!

I launched the drone from up there too.  I did lose some gps a bit when I went high so had to bring it down a bit.  Plus I am not a very experienced drone pilot. There are monkeys here too so if you’re scared get someone to shoe them away for you.  There’s plenty of warungs to eat or drink at.

Chris S,Nov-19,"We went in low season, but even then it was busy with Instagram warriors queuing up in sweltering heat for once spot at the top of the cliff. Ignore these clowns and walk about 100m down the cliff for the same if that's what you're there for.The preparation part: if you want to actually go on to the beach it's roughly a 25 min, relatively intense walk/climb down. Do not attempt in flip-flops, and bring a bottle of water each. There are choke points where you'll have to wait 5+ mins for people to go up/down, and it is very steep at points. Essentially they've tacted barriers onto quite a sheer cliff face.It's well worth the climb however. The beach was relatively quiet (note again low season), has a shop for drinks and light snacks.The waves were powerful. It's not a beach for chilled floating around unless you swim past the sand bar and break. (Which is totally do able). Also be aware there is a strong rip tide.Had a great time, it's very clear water aside the sand being churned up and refreshingly cool.","We went in low season, but even then it was busy with Instagram warriors queuing up in sweltering heat for once spot at the top of the cliff.

Pam R,Nov-19,"What an amazing spot!  Water colour is stunning. White sand. Clean beach. Waves can be rough so you need to be careful. The climb up and down is for the fit otherwise it will be a struggle coming up. It is very steep and can be narrow in parts. Most of the track is made from clay so it isn’t man made ‘stairs’. We wore thongs going down, not a good idea! And we put our joggers on coming back up. If you have joggers definitely wear them. Take water a large one with you in a backpack as you will need both hands free for the climb. There is water on sale on the beach but I believe it is expensive. Only toilets are at the top of the cliff none on the beach. Do this as early as you can as it is very hot climbing. Definitely worth seeing. ","What an amazing spot!  Water colour is stunning.

so i had to buy the most expensive water in bali at 100,000 rps for 2 litres.the beach is stunning and you certainly feel exhilarated when you get to the bottom. the waves are huge and very strong so be very careful.the climb up was quicker as later in day and not many coming down, but one hell of a work out. my leg muscles ached so much i could hardly walk for 2 days. but one of our most memorable days out and we had some great days in bali and nusa penida ",kelingking beach is absolutely stunning but the hike down the mountain path is not for the faint hearted or the unfitthe path down starts of reasonably easy after 20 mins or so it takes a turn back on its self and then the fun really starts it was very busy and often grid locked as people are trying to come up at the same time and it is at times very tricky and you have to have 3 point contact it took us 1 12 hrs to get down due to the amount of people coming up make sure you take water as on the cliff face it is very hot and if you are like me you is gonna sweatthere is a little stall on the beach selling water now foolishly i only took a small amount of water for a family of 4not very clever so i had to buy the most expensive water in bali at 100000 rps for 2 litresthe beach is stunning and you certainly feel exhilarated when you get to the bottom the waves are huge and very strong so be very carefulthe climb up was quicker as later in day and not many coming down but one hell of a work out my leg muscles ached so much i could hardly walk for 2 days but one of our most memorable days out and we had some great days in bali and nusa penida ,kelingking beach absolutely stunning hike mountain path faint hearted unfitthe path starts reasonably easy 20 mins takes turn back self fun really starts busy often grid locked people trying come time times tricky 3 point contact took us 1 12 hrs get due amount people coming make sure take water cliff face hot like gonna sweatthere little stall beach selling water foolishly took small amount water family 4not clever buy expensive water bali 100000 rps 2 litresthe beach stunning certainly feel exhilarated get bottom waves huge strong carefulthe climb quicker later day many coming one hell work leg muscles ached much could hardly walk 2 days one memorable days great days bali nusa penida,kelingking absolutely stunning hike mountain path faint hearted unfitthe path starts reasonably easy 20 mins takes turn back self fun really starts busy often grid locked people trying come time times tricky 3 point contact took us 1 12 hrs due amount people coming make sure water cliff face hot like gonna sweatthere little stall selling water foolishly took small amount water family 4not clever buy expensive water bali 100000 rps 2 litresthe stunning certainly feel exhilarated bottom waves huge strong carefulthe climb quicker later day many coming one hell work leg muscles ached much could hardly walk 2 days one memorable days great days bali,kelingking absolutely stunning hike mountain path faint hearted unfitthe path starts reasonably easy 20 mins takes turn back self fun really starts busy often grid locked people trying come time times tricky 3 point contact took us 1 12 hrs due amount people coming make sure water cliff face hot like gonna sweatthere little stall selling water foolishly took small amount water family 4not clever buy expensive water bali 100000 rps 2 litresthe stunning certainly feel exhilarated bottom waves huge strong carefulthe climb quicker later day many coming one hell work leg muscles ached much could hardly walk 2 days one memorable days great days bali,kelingk absolut stun hike mountain path faint heart unfitth path start reason easi 20 min take turn back self fun realli start busi often grid lock peopl tri come time time tricki 3 point contact took us 1 12 hr due amount peopl come make sure water cliff face hot like gonna sweatther littl stall sell water foolishli took small amount water famili 4not clever buy expens water bali 100000 rp 2 litresth stun certainli feel exhilar bottom wave huge strong carefulth climb quicker later day mani come one hell work leg muscl ach much could hardli walk 2 day one memor day great day bali,kelingking absolutely stun hike mountain path faint hearted unfitthe path start reasonably easy 20 min take turn back self fun really start busy often grid locked people try come time time tricky 3 point contact take u 1 12 hr due amount people come make sure water cliff face hot like gonna sweatthere little stall selling water foolishly take small amount water family 4not clever buy expensive water bali 100000 rps 2 litresthe stun certainly feel exhilarated bottom wave huge strong carefulthe climb quicker later day many come one hell work leg muscle ache much could hardly walk 2 day one memorable day great day bali,"{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.666, 'pos': 0.233, 'compound': 0.9516}",0.9516,1

Piyush Thakur,Oct-19,"Its a long review but here is what I feel There is a lot of debate on whether you should trek down to the Kelingking beach or not. Lot of vloggers have posted their videos online on the same topic and there are conflicting views on it. For me it was the trek which made all the difference. I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 9:30 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly. Every 5 minutes take a pause and just look around the surroundings , then you will realise why I am asking you to trek down. Once you reach down then you will see an absolutely gorgeous beach with so strong waves . This is what I am talking about. .. This was my best part of Bali trip and I'll come back again to spend atleat 4-5 hours on this beach.

Photos don't justify the beauty of this place ","Its a long review but here is what I feel There is a lot of debate on whether you should trek down to the Kelingking beach or not. Lot of vloggers have posted their videos online on the same topic and there are conflicting views on it. For me it was the trek which made all the difference. I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 90 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly.

ThomasArabia,Oct-19,"First of all, its off course a breathtakingly beautiful beach. But that’s exactly the problem. Its super crowded. The hike:it looks very steep from the top. But its really doable. The first half downwards are proper albeit big steps with proper handrails. That part is safe, although already somewhat exposed. For people who feel a bit afraid here it’s probably better to turn around at the end of the proper steps, because its getting much steeper afterwards and one needs to scramble down some rocks. There are still handrails, but further down they consist of some lose bamboo sticks only. Overall its not technically difficult, but not for people who are afraid of hwights. It takes around 20 min up or down, if it would be empty. But with people in flipflops (!) and traffic jams it will take longer, and its hot! on the beach is a little kiosk to buy refreshments though.","First of all, its off course a breathtakingly beautiful beach.

333kimberleys,Sep-19,"Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins) and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot... This is dingy with rats on the rafters and you can select from 2 meals being the cheapest on the menu... This part was private as it was just me and my mum with our driver. Please take travel sickness tablets with you!!! The roads are next level horrible... I've travelled a fair bit and I have never seen roads this bad... I got car sickness in about 15 minutes... And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us. It seems noones safety is considered on this trip and in this day and age it's disappointing that so many people's life's at put at risk to make some money.","Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold!

And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us. It seems noones safety is considered on this trip and in this day and age it's disappointing that so many people's life's at put at risk to make some money.","Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot...

It’s definitely do able to hike half way down where there are physical steps to the picture points and get some nice shots. However BE WARNED once you get past the main bit (you will know when) the trail gets INCREDIBLY steep and there are no longer steps, you are from that point on literally rock climbing down an almost upright cliff. In hindsight I would not have gone down as we fell multiple times and was extremely exhausting on the way up. I have cuts on my knees from where I had to essentially crawl up. The beach down there is amazing but you could get access to a beach equally as amazing without the near death experience. If you’re physically fit and enjoy the thrill of hiking / mountain climbing then go ahead. If you’re an average person - YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!!

MJL,Sep-19,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn. Beautiful as it is, this attraction is going to make headlines for all the wrong reasons if responsible action is not taken soon.","Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed.

emma,Aug-19,"The road to kelingking by motor or car is rough anyways, I can say that 70% of the road was fine and the rest was unpaved rough road. The scene is definitely very beautiful, simply amazing. From the top you can see amazing views of the beach and you can even spot manta ray fish, we could see at least 4. Then we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so we can swim in beautiful turquoise sea and play in the white soft sand. However, there was almost no stairs, it was more similar to climbing a rocky mountain, it was very steep, long, and challenging. Wearing a shoe for this hike is a must. The first half of the broken stairs was fine but the other half was definitely harder, no stairs, only broken rocks to step on. I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs. After finally reaching the bottom, it was all still beautiful, but the sea was also rough, high waves and strong tide, so it was hard to relax in the sea. In the beach there was only one small place selling some drinks and snacks. Overall, it was definitely very beautiful, the view and scene was amazing. The challenge is a bit hard but worth it and we all felt great after doing all this. I would give it 5 stars if only it was better maintained (stairs and facilities) considering the amount of tourists that come to this place.

Ryan,Jun-19,"Keling king beach is as crazy beautiful as any of these photos show. It's rather crowded, with everyone trying to get a good Instagram photo (as much of Bali is these days) but it's still off the radar of most travelers. And the rest of the island is even more so - most people still visit for a day trip. And that's their loss. Nusa Penida lacks the amenities and entertainment of Bali, but it puts Bali's beaches to shame. Absolutely great for hiking, sight seeing, and quiet relaxation. I strongly suggest staying on Penida and touring the island for a few days. Just be careful getting around as the roads are in dire shape.","Keling king beach is as crazy beautiful as any of these photos show.

It’s v difficult to do the trail without proper shoes.In the small backpack, we plan to pack some snacks a beach towel plus some water and even beer if the bag isn’t too heavy!The beach looked so secluded and beautiful from above so I think it’s definitely worth a climb down. Pencil in the whole day to enjoy this place if you already are exhausting all your energy climbing down. Everyone stops at the top for photos only so if that’s all you plan to do, go early!We took the tour from Nusa Island Surf School who organised a 7am departure from Nusa Lembongan on boat then to a car once we got to Nusa Penida. We got to Kelingkling beach before 9am, by 10, it was non stop tourist traffic.There are small warungs there so easy to buy water food and beer as well.Have a great time!

We got to Kelingkling beach before 9am, by 10, it was non stop tourist traffic.There are small warungs there so easy to buy water food and beer as well.Have a great time! It’s an absolute must to see this place :)","So after going one time and not knowing what to expect, this is our tips if we were to do it again.Pack a small backpack so you can have your fitflops with you when you hike down to the beach. It’s v difficult to do the trail without proper shoes.In the small backpack, we plan to pack some snacks a beach towel plus some water and even beer if the bag isn’t too heavy!The beach looked so secluded and beautiful from above so I think it’s definitely worth a climb down.

Prothu,May-19,"Me and my husband went there to celebrate our marriage  anniversary.The place is amazing. View is just awesome. The turquoise water attracted both of us and we couldn't hold ourself getting down the beach. It was very risky to go down, very stiff and narrow path. However we went down there and it took about 1 hour. After getting down there you will feel that yes the effort comming down worth it. The big waves and white sands are mind blowing.As the waves were big i didn't dive into but my husband went for swim. Unfortunately i was just standing nearby and feeling the waves touching my feets, suddenly a very stong wave came and just made me fall down. I was not able to getup and within a fraction of second it took me away deep.I thought i was dead. My husband came to fetch me but along with me he was also drowning. Thanks to the other foreign visitors those helped both of us from being drowned. 4 of them dragged both of us simultaneously. It was so dangerous and i was very scared. I'll never forget this accident. So guys please dont swim in high tides not even stand nearby the waves.Thanks to Almighty for saving both of us.Then all of them encouraged us and half an hour later we decided to climb up. It took 1.5 hours to climb up and was too sunny. Very hard to climp up, no shadows , no place to take rest. But the place was really very beautiful. A must visit in Nusa Penida. Suggestions:1. Pls wear sneakers /slippers whatever you feel comfort. We went down there with slipper.2. Hat/Cap3. Plenty of water bottles. Down there 1 500 ml bottle is 30 k IDR4. Chocolate / dry foods5.Dont dive into the sea. ","Me and my husband went there to celebrate our marriage  anniversary.The place is amazing. View is just awesome.

Canadian,Jun-19,"Honestly, 100 times better if you go while staying on the island and not as a day trip. We arrived around 9 am. Paid 11,000 per two people (including parking scooter)There were only a dozen or so people. Plenty of space to enjoy the view and take pictures. We decided to take the grueling stairs down- I'm not going to lie it is steep! But a nice challenge, if you are looking for a good work out it's worth it. But once we got down we weren't sure the point of heading down. The beach is nice, but you can't swim. So we didn't really see the point of going down in the end. We returned to the top around 11am and there were TONS of people. It was insane, basically a line to get to the edge to take a picture. Coming back up was also brutal but only because there were so many people on the stairs. Overall take home message for us, go in the morning and don't bother with the way down. FYI there are also two other view points further down the road and again no one was there.","Honestly, 100 times better if you go while staying on the island and not as a day trip.

After about 45 mins we arrived at Nusa Penida, this was onto a proper harbour wall so didn’t get wet getting off the boat.  We did some snorkelling at Crystal Bay, Gammet Bay and GT wall in a local fisherman outrigger boat.We then got into a 4wd for a lunch stop and drove the long windy road with some of it rough, potholed and unsealed to Klingking beach.  The view makes it all worth while.  Very popular with tourists. It is then back on the unsealed road about an hour drive to Nusa Penida harbour for the 45 min fast boat back to Sanur.

Chandré B,Jun-19,"Getting to Kelingking Beach is not easy. Although the road is being fixed, it is a difficult ride on a scooter if you are not used to driving on rough terrain.

If you decide to descend, be prepared for a difficult climb. We arrived in sandals, and ended up going barefoot instead. Going back you need to use your hands to climb back up.

wardellkate,May-19,We hadn’t read anything about kelingking so had no idea that there was the hilariously steep climb. The descent was harder partially due to all the instagram photo shoots happening at the top and a flip flop wearing senior citizen who didn’t let people pass him. I would recommend going down backwards in some areas and make use of the railings/ropes where they exist.The beach at the bottom was amazing . The tide is very strong but there is also a life guard pointing out the less dangerous sections. The climb up is easier than doing down.When we got to the top there were like 10x as many people as when we had started . It seemed like hundreds of minivans had all arrived at once full of people doing day trips over from Bali. If you are staying on Nusa Penida I would ask your driver to take you there early morning or after the day trips will have finished for the day. ,We hadn’t read anything about kelingking so had no idea that there was the hilariously steep climb.

This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‘T-Rex Bay’. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it’s during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you’ve reached the sand, you’ll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated.

Timmi002,Apr-19,"This place is absolutely stunning and amazing.  This is THE REASON to come to Nusa Penida.  Totally worth the trouble of taking the boat over from Sanur.  The views from up top are breathtaking.  Expect massive crowds as this is one of Bali's biggest attractions.  If you want to escape the crowds, hike down to the beach.  It takes about an hour to get down and a bit more to come back up.  The path is super steep and not for the faint hearted as you are basically scaling a rock face to get down to the beach. But it's so worth it as the sand is pure and fine, the views are incredible and it's peaceful because only a fraction of the visitors come all the way down. I don't recommend flip flops but most people used just that.  Closed toe shoes that fasten to your feet like water shoes, Tevas, or sneakers would be better.  The bottom is rustic so bring everything you might need with you including water and towel.  Note: I think there was a guy selling water.  Be careful in the water as the waves are crazy.  One knocked me down and I had sand coming out of my ears for days.  But it was super fun.  If you have a sense of adventure, definitely do this!!!","This place is absolutely stunning and amazing.

Expect massive crowds as this is one of Bali's biggest attractions.  If you want to escape the crowds, hike down to the beach.  It takes about an hour to get down and a bit more to come back up.  The path is super steep and not for the faint hearted as you are basically scaling a rock face to get down to the beach. But it's so worth it as the sand is pure and fine, the views are incredible and it's peaceful because only a fraction of the visitors come all the way down. I don't recommend flip flops but most people used just that.  Closed toe shoes that fasten to your feet like water shoes, Tevas, or sneakers would be better.  The bottom is rustic so bring everything you might need with you including water and towel.  Note: I think there was a guy selling water.  Be careful in the water as the waves are crazy.

Dani W,May-19,"The view from the top is spectacular, if you can see past the hordes of Instagrammers who rode up in their air conditioned vans. To get away from the crowd, I decided to do the trek/climb down to the beach, despite a previous guide telling me it was ""very dangerous."" Guys, it's not that bad. Given, I'm a rock climber who's in pretty good shape, but the steps are worn into the rock and the hand railing is solid up until the last maybe 100m, when you should test it before pulling hard. I wouldn't do it in flip flops, but I found my running sandals worked fine -- sneakers would've prevented me from feeling the rock. But if you're scared of heights, have knee problems, or aren't physically fit, probably skip the climb down. At the bottom of the climb is the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. Perfect white sand flecked with pieces of coral, a massive cavern on one side of the beach, and the T-Rex cliff on the other. The waves are big, strong, shore breakers and there is a fairly hefty rip current. If you are not an experienced ocean swimmer I'd suggest staying out of the water; I saw multiple people get thrown onto the coral-flecked shore by a wave, and it didn't look pleasant. If, on other hand, you know what you're doing in the water, get in! The slight danger makes it that much more exciting.","The view from the top is spectacular, if you can see past the hordes of Instagrammers who rode up in their air conditioned vans.

William L,Feb-19,Last min decision to do a day trip to Nusa Penida and this was one of the unforgettable experience. We took a tour that visit 4 places in Nusa Penida which include the boat trip to the island and car transfer to each site. The downside is that you cant stay too  long at each place around 30mins to 45mins most. If you really want to enjoy Kelingking beach and climb down to the beach it is recommended to get get your own transfer once arrive in the island. The tour I bought was west trip package.from 630am and get back at hotel at 6pm.The road is really bad and its a 40mins super bumpy ride to Kelingking Beach. I would only do it once more time as I didnt get a chance to climb down to the beach. The view was amazing and it is just as what is shown on instagram!! take as many pics as you want and just be safe! It is best to come here early (10am or earlier) to aovid the crowd.,Last min decision to do a day trip to Nusa Penida and this was one of the unforgettable experience.

You need a very good condition, shouldn’t be afraid of heights and please don’t wear Flipflops but proper shoes (I didn’t). The „safety“, if you call it like this, is definitely not comparable to European standards.Once you reach the beach it’s worth the strains! But keep in mind that swimming is not possible due to huge waves and unpredictable and strong currents. So...cool down in the ocean a bit before starting the uphill which should be preferably before the masses of tourists arrive, otherwise you need hours to go back up.","We went to Kelingking early in the morning to avoid the day tourists which was a good decision.

I’d advise getting there as early as this or even earlier to firstly hike in the cooler weather before it gets too hot and secondly so you can have the whole beach to yourself! Truly amazing.The hike itself is tough. We are both athleticly for and found it a challenge. It’s mostly rock climbing and if the weather has been raining the night before it’s very slippery. Make sure you wear trainers and sensible clothes. The halfway point hike isn’t too bad but to carry on after this and go to the beach is where it gets hard. There are ropes to help guide you down but once you’re down it’s so beautiful. Litter-free, supersoft sand and clear water. Not safe enough to swim in but still stunning.

WarrenMoonjr,Feb-19,"The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. Kelingking beach is located on Nusa Penida, with is a separate island located about 30 minutes by boat from Sanur, Bali. Nusa Penida is still undeveloped, and I would recommend spending a few nights here to really enjoy the island. Another option would be staying on Nusa Lembongan which is only a 5 minute boat ride away from Penida, it has more accommodation options available (in total their are 3 Nusa Islands all located next to each other). Note: It's takes about 30 minutes to get down to the actual beach at Kelingking, but around 1-1.5 hrs to climb back up. The stairs are steep and rocky, not the easiest climb. Their are hand rails most of the way, would not recommend the climb for anyone with mobility or endurance issues. Many people simply come and take pictures from the top without ever climbing down to the water. And that works fine for all fitness/mobility levels. It's a very popular spot, get there early if you can to avoid the crowds. Nusa Penida is amazing, this isn't a spot to rush through in one day. They have tons of great beaches (like crystal bay), great snorkeling, and landmarks like angels billabong, broken beach, etc. The roads to get around the island are in pretty bad shape. Tons of potholes and rubble. It takes a long time to travel around the island because of the bad conditions. If you are renting a scooter be very careful on the roads. You can also rent a driver to get around, it's expensive, but worth it for convenience.","The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot.

GodBlessMali,Feb-19,"Even though I went to Bali for scuba diving, I had to spend one day visiting the west part of Nusa Penida which I believe is more famous and appealing than the east part.My first stop was the Kelingking beach which I absolutely loved. Many people complained about the crowd, but if you visit it before 11AM like I did, you won't see a lot of people until you go back to the top.The view from the top is breathtaking, and you can fully admire the T-Rex shape that everyone talks about. However, there is more to it. If you take your courage in both hands, and make it all the way down to the beach, you will not regret it. Though be warned than it's rather tricky to reach to the beach, and I strongly recommend you to wear a good pair of shoes over sandals, but you will want to wear the latter once you reach the beach. A woman twisted her ankle on the way down, and I have absolutely no idea how she made it back to the top so please be careful if you wish to go to the beach.Once you are at the beach, simply enjoy. The waves crushing on the beach make it a very relaxing place, and the view is also quite amazing. That said, if you wish to swim, you might be disappointed as the currents are quite strong, and only experienced swimmers should enjoy.Again, if you want to fully enjoy this place, go early in the day. There were six or seven people on the beach when I went in the morning, but close to a hundred when I went back up early in the afternoon.Enjoy :)","Even though I went to Bali for scuba diving, I had to spend one day visiting the west part of Nusa Penida which I believe is more famous and appealing than the east part.My first stop was the Kelingking beach which I absolutely loved.

We didnt go down to the beach as you can tell by the path, that its not an easy one to climb down and up - it's really steep and adventurous! We also heard stories of people who went down and were stuck as they couldnt come up. Only thing annoying was the number of instagram crazy people who would do anything for a perfect picture! We even thought some of them were going to fall down the cliff as they were staying really close to the edge. We went in the supposedly low season, and I thought this was crowded.

It takes about 30-45 min to get down and it can get very steep and hard on the knees. Going up can require a lot of water because it’s incredibly hot.Once you’re up, there are some restaurants offering all kind of things to eat.

The climb itself is quite difficult. It took us approximately 30mins to get back to the top and we are relatively fit people. At some parts you will be basically rock climbing vertically (your legs and muscles will be sore the next day). The lack of stairs makes it challenging but is also what makes it adventurous and fun. The beach is really nice. It does have large waves and currents, so listen to the lifeguard and be prepared to be dumped by the waves at some point. I would definitely recommend this climb and beach!

Shyama R,Dec-18,"Well this is the most beautiful beach I have seen in my lifeAfter seeing the beach from the cliff we decided we had to go down.  The whole climb was not easy. There are no stairs. Just the rocks with some space. Wooden blocks or bamboos are placed on both sides for support. At certain point there is only place for 1 person to stand at a time. It will take 20-30min to go down. But it's worth it. Clean and blue beach. The waves are strong yet awesome. Caves on both sides. It just like in movies. Beware on climb up as it will drain you. Took us around 1 hour. And the sun was just bright and hurting us. Well no matter how dangerous it was, everything was worth it. If you just want to  stay at the cliff and click only photos.

rgill_28,Nov-18,"Stunning view from up top of the dinosaur rock. Can get really pretty views at sunset. That hike down. Oh wow, that was very very hard. It’s extremely slippery going down. I have size 14 feet which made it very difficult for me to find footing to place my feet. I hike quite often back home in Western Canada, so I felt pretty confident doing it until I slipped and fell and cut up my elbows. Then entire way down, shaking legs and thoughts of “oh god I’m going to die here.” I advice anyone doing this hike: if you struggled in the first half of the hike which is until the dinosaur’s back and then u turn towards the beach and start going down to do other half. TURN back! So can get some very pretty pictures from there because the second half down is soooo much worse and extremely steep with very tight spacing which makes it very tricky when ur going down and ppl are coming up. Some ppl were doing the hike bare feet to get better grip which might be an idea worth trying?!?Once you get down to the beach, it is pure paradise. Can’t swim in it but the massive waves are beautiful to see and there is a tiny stand down there serving drinks which is cool. Can’t believe they go up/down that hike every day with merchandise. Hike back up was fine for me because I have strong upper body and it requires lots of pulling yourself up holding onto support branches that are places along hike. My wife who has weak upper body found it very challenging going back up and was sore for about 3 days where she couldn’t move her arms without pain.

emtod,Oct-18,"Obviously I saw a photo of Kelingking Beach on Instagram about 2 years ago, and ever since then I knew I had to go see it. Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able. I could have done it in flip flops, but I didn't want to ditch my husband lol.Beyond the actual views, there are a bunch of warungs where you can get food and drink, fresh coconut, etc. We did have to pay a small fee (15,000? 11,000 IDR?) to park our motorbike there as well, which was fine. The road to the actual beach is not paved and needs some serious work -- the east side of the island, in comparison, is *much* nicer in that regard.

I put stairs quotations because it is in fact a narrow, steep, and uneven pathway made of jagged rocks and a hand-fashioned bamboo rail. The descent and climb back to the top were quite taxing and I would not encourage it for anyone with poor physical health.Unfortunately the beach is very wavy with strong currents so you are unable to fully get in to the water at the beach.

Billinda1964,Oct-18,"One of the best and most terrifying experiences of my life... My boyfriend and I tackled the hike down to the beach at about 9am. Not too busy at this time but still people around. The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help. A lot of people will not be as lucky. Enjoy every minute but be safe and look after people around you. Really sad to hear about people drowning here and it happens far too often :( An amazing experience but very dangerous. :) ","One of the best and most terrifying experiences of my life... My boyfriend and I tackled the hike down to the beach at about 9am. Not too busy at this time but still people around. The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help. A lot of people will not be as lucky. Enjoy every minute but be safe and look after people around you.

DjaliDjali,Oct-18,"It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida. It requires good physical condition to go up, down and up again, especially under the tropical sun. It's located quite far, 1,5 hour approximately from Sampalan, the main port to reach Nusa Penida from Sanur. Because of its popularity, to avoid the crowd, I suggest you to be here around 8 am. The earliest fast boat leaves Sanur at 7.30 with 45 minutes travel duration. So people start coming from Bali main island from 10 am approx. It'd be ideal if you spend a night in Nusa Penida and arrive early in Kelingking beach. So you can enjoy the white sandy, secluded beach on your own for some time. You take steepy stairs to go down that only fit for one person. In the busy hours, people make quite long queue waiting to go up or down in turns, one by one. The shower room isn't available on the beach, it's on the cliff. You should pay 5000 IDR to use the shower room/toilet.I wonder how grand the view would be during sunset time. If you spend a night in Nusa Penida, you can try to watch sunset here. Altough the lack of street light and poor condition of asphalt in some parts throughout the journey would be a challenge.And dear my fellow travellers, please mind your trash. The waste management here hasn't been well developed. Bring home your garbage, avoid using plastic straw & buy the mineral water in big size (1L).Happy travelling","It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida.

Ellen F,Oct-18,"We visited Kelingking and took on the trek down the cliff edge to the beautiful beach below. As other reviewers have said you MUST wear appropriate shoes if you are taking this on. We saw many people struggling in flip flops and even saw one girl slip and fall, losing a flip flop through the gap in the fence that saved her. We wore Tevas sandals, sneakers would also be appropriate. If you're in good shape and don't mind a scramble, this should be fine for you. Avoid midday as heat can be unbearable. The worst thing (and my reason for four stars) is that the tides and waves are VERY strong. There are a few flags and a guy with a whistle but not much else to keep you safe.

There were lot of tourists on top of the beack too, but not so many that you couldn't just take in the views and enjoy.There are some scams (at least they feel like scams) on the beach by locals, so be aware. Our guide actually adviced us couple of times to climb ladders into this little wooden thing, where you could take selfies with a better view. So we did althought the wooden thing didn't look so special. When we came down, the local lady was asking us for 5 k per person. It was written with a shaky handwriting on a very little sign next to the ladders. We paid, as it isn't that much, but I just felt fooled. I feel like this kind of ""take a picture here and pay 5/10 k"" are just one big scam. Entrance fees are okay if the proceeds go into the maintenance/property management, but otherwise...

adviced us couple of times to climb ladders into this little wooden thing, where you could take selfies with a better view. so we did althought the wooden thing didn't look so special. when we came down, the local lady was asking us for 5 k per person. it was written with a shaky handwriting on a very little sign next to the ladders. we paid, as it isn't that much, but i just felt fooled. i feel like this kind of ""take a picture here and pay 5/10 k"" are just one big scam. entrance fees are okay if the proceeds go into the maintenance/property management, but otherwise... please stop, this is not that appealing to tourists since it lefts you only with a feeling of being fooled.",we visited kelinking beach during the evening when the sun was setting around 6 pm the views looked just

Mark Joven,Sep-18,I have to say my favorite spot in Nusa Penida island and worth going especially if you’ll have time going down to the beach.

If you’re afraid of heights then try to be brave and strong if you want to have a perfect Instagram shot because by just merely sitting at the cliff is nerve braking.

Trav,Jul-18,"Kelingking beach is just something you have to see to believe, it is amazing. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the manta rays swimming around at the beach below. A few things to note:The road out to Kelingking is rough, if you decide to do it on a scooter you should be careful as there are a lot of bumps, rocks, soft sand and taxis to contend with. I have heard that the taxi/tour van ride out is quite rough also but if you aren't confident on a scooter then I suggest taking a tour or taxi.This is the number one attraction on Nusa Penida so it gets very busy, if you stay on the island I recommend going early before the boats bring in day tourists.The best view is from the top, but you can hike down to the beach but be warned that it is not an easy one, I recommend wearing sneakers/runners for extra grip and just for feet protection.Areas of the hike down are super steep and quite difficult to negotiate so take your time. Plenty of people do this hike so there are sections where you will have to stop and wait to let people pass you. Be considerate of others and lend them a hand when it's safe to do so. This is a cliffs side you are climbing down which has little shade and sometimes no wind so it gets very hot. Once you make it down to the beach, there is one person who is selling some drinks and snacks but don't expect to have a wide variety and you will pay slightly more then you would normally. It would be wise to take some water and snacks with you. The beach is not necessarily a swim friendly beach, no life guards patrol the beach, the waves can be quite big and come from different directions. If you aren't a strong swimmer I highly advise you don't go in very deep. I swam out into the water and got to swim with some rays which was awesome. It was hard to get in and out safely and I am a strong swimmer.This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so if you do decide to do it.

GolakaNath,Jun-18,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here. From Kelingking cliff we drove to Crystal Bay to see the sunset.","WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach.

Since I'm in a rush of hour to go other places, maybe next time I'll do it.Overall, it takes around 30 min from Nusa Penida port to Kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do off-road. So, I'd suggest that a pregnant woman to do not join this trip due to safety reason. Hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. 🙏🏻Besides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited.

The others are only available for bungalows and homestay.","it's really amazing when you reach this place. we just like see heaven and paradise. the shape of cliff like a t-rex which is very interesting. blue ocean is the view in front of the cliff, very clear and clean beach. actually we can go down for swimming activity or just taking photo in the beach instead of on top of the cliff, but it needs around 1 hour by walking down. since i'm in a rush of hour to go other places, maybe next time i'll do it.overall, it takes around 30 min from nusa penida port to kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do off-road. so, i'd suggest that a pregnant woman to do not join this trip due to safety reason. hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. besides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited. according to my local guide, there's only 1 star hotel near the nusa penida port. the others are only available for bungalows and homestay.",its really amazing when you reach this place we just like see heaven and paradise the shape of cliff like a trex which is very interesting blue ocean is the view in front of the cliff very clear and clean beach actually we can go down for swimming activity or just taking photo in the beach instead of on top of the cliff but it needs around 1 hour by walking down since im in a rush of hour to go other places maybe next time ill do itoverall it takes around 30 min from nusa penida port to kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do offroad so id suggest that a pregnant woman to do not join this trip due to safety reason hopefully in couple of years the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place besides that the number of stars hotel are still very limited according to my local guide theres only 1 star hotel near the nusa penida port the others are only available for bungalows and homestay,really amazing reach place like see heaven paradise shape cliff like trex interesting blue ocean view front cliff clear clean beach actually go swimming activity taking photo beach instead top cliff needs around 1 hour walking since im rush hour go places maybe next time ill itoverall takes around 30 min nusa penida port kelingking cliff wavy unsmooth road car like offroad id suggest pregnant woman join trip due safety reason hopefully couple years road smooth everyone go beautiful place besides number stars hotel still limited according local guide theres 1 star hotel near nusa penida port others available bungalows homestay,really amazing reach like see heaven paradise shape cliff like trex interesting blue ocean front cliff clear clean actually swimming activity taking photo instead top cliff needs around 1 hour walking since im rush hour places maybe next time ill itoverall takes around 30 min port kelingking cliff wavy unsmooth road car like offroad id suggest pregnant woman join trip due safety reason hopefully couple years road smooth everyone besides number stars hotel still limited according local guide theres 1 star hotel near port others available bungalows homestay,really amazing reach like see heaven paradise shape cliff like trex interesting blue ocean front cliff clear clean actually swimming activity taking photo instead top cliff needs around 1 hour walking since im rush hour places maybe next time ill itoverall takes around 30 min port kelingking cliff wavy unsmooth road car like offroad id suggest pregnant woman join trip due safety reason hopefully couple years road smooth everyone besides number stars hotel still limited according local guide theres 1 star hotel near port others available bungalows homestay,realli amaz reach like see heaven paradis shape cliff like trex interest blue ocean front cliff clear clean actual swim activ take photo instead top cliff need around 1 hour walk sinc im rush hour place mayb next time ill itoveral take around 30 min port kelingk cliff wavi unsmooth road car like offroad id suggest pregnant woman join trip due safeti reason hope coupl year road smooth everyon besid number star hotel still limit accord local guid there 1 star hotel near port other avail bungalow homestay,really amazing reach like see heaven paradise shape cliff like trex interest blue ocean front cliff clear clean actually swim activity take photo instead top cliff need around 1 hour walk since im rush hour place maybe next time ill itoverall take around 30 min port kelingking cliff wavy unsmooth road car like offroad id suggest pregnant woman join trip due safety reason hopefully couple year road smooth everyone besides number star hotel still limit accord local guide theres 1 star hotel near port others available bungalow homestay,"{'neg': 0.025, 'neu': 0.619, 'pos': 0.357, 'compound': 0.9868}",0.9868,1

didisand,May-18,"If you come to Nusa Penida you cannot skip Kelinking beach since it is one of the biggest sightseeings on the island. The road has parts that were okay but some of them were very bumpy, with a lot of holes in them and the last 10 minutes are all sand and stones with holes. My boyfriend and I were traveling with a rented motorcycle and this was the 5th day of us driving (never had before) and we managed just fine but keep in mind that it is nit easy at all. You can hire a local driver but the experience is not the same at all. The view point on the cliff is overcrowded with a lot of tourists. You wait in line to make photos. The views are breathtaking though, you have to see them live (just what you would put as a desktop wallpaper)! If you are hungry, you can visit one of the warungs (local restaurants) there. The parking fee is 5 000 Rp/motorbike. There is a steep path down the beach but if you plan to go there go as early as you can since the road is long and the path to the beach is hard and with no shadow. Don’t recommend to watch the sunset here - the road as I said is in very bad condition and dangerous in the day not to say at night.","If you come to Nusa Penida you cannot skip Kelinking beach since it is one of the biggest sightseeings on the island.

Much of the road to Kelingking Broken is completely destroyed by tourist van traffic, leaving the locals in a horrible position.

Traveller123,Feb-18,"My self and a friend traveled to this spot by motorbike which we rented at the port for around $5 AUD. The roads are in terrible conditions at some points so I wouldn't recommend going this way unless you experienced riding. We reached Kelingking took a couple photos and without hesitation made our way down towards the beach. Let's just say going down was the easy part, The mountain is extremely steep with only some bamboo tied together with some rope to 'stop' you from falling off the edge. It is also extremely hot so take a lot of water, but don't pack too much as the climb back up the mountain can become extremely difficult if you have a lot to carry. Once you do get down to the bottom you can not enter the water, as it is dangerously rough, the waves are huge and crash right on the shore with that much power that even standing meters away you are almost swept off your feet. We were also lucky enough to be able to purchase some water and beers down the bottom as well. We made the silly mistake of drinking a beer before the climb back up which we both regretted as the climb is so hard and with a beer in your belly you do not feel good. The climb back up was exhausting, and we almost passed out from the heat a couple of times because there is absolutely no relief from the sun and we started the climb back up at 12:30 - 1:00 pm. I wouldn't say I am unfit but we both really struggled. We timed the climb up and it took us about 30 mins - although it felt a lot longer!All in all - its an experience like none other! Would I do it again HELL NO. But I would tell anyone who is up for it to give it a go! My body ached for the next 3 days.","My self and a friend traveled to this spot by motorbike which we rented at the port for around $5 AUD.

A Raz,Apr-18,"I've been to Bali numerous times and visited many of its beaches but Kelingking Beach is particularly outstanding. The view from the cliff is just amazing and (if you're fit enough to descend to the beach and climb back up) the beach itself is very rewarding. Yes! It's quite an effort to go down to the beach, but that what makes it worth the effort. The sand, the wave, everything is so perfect.If you wanna go down to the beach, my recommendation is to go there early in the morning. Travel light. Going down to the beach is quite dangerous.. use practical and comfortable sandals. While down there.. just enjoy the beach for a couple of hours.. You could also bring bento to have lunch down there. After you gain back your energy then climb back up. Climbing back up is actually a lot easier than going down, but it takes more energy.This place is very recommended and I would defly go back there again!PS: It takes around 20-40 minutes to descend and 10-20 minutes to climb up, depending on your level of fitness.","I've been to Bali numerous times and visited many of its beaches but Kelingking Beach is particularly outstanding.

Voguely Vivien,Oct-17,"Worth the (rather rocky) journey to Kelingking Beach. Apparently it will take years before they can upgrade the gravel roads to tar ones. While it is possible to rent mopeds to get around simply anywhere in Nusa Penida, personally I won't recommend them!

I suggest either renting vehicles with driver (500k+ for one day) or ojek aka moped riders (70k for one day) to show you around. I did both and the latter was quite an experience!

The way down is difficult (some may say quite dangerous) the way up is straight up a full workout. I have never been sweatier before I think. What you get when you do this to yourself is a dirty beach tons of jellyfish on the Beach and in the water and local People trying to sell you snacks and water which you will eventually actualy need.I would Not recommend you to Go down when your are Not in a good shape or if you expect the beach of your dreams.,So the view really is amazing.

Amy T,Mar-18,"I had been wanting to visit Nusa Penida after seeing the beautiful pictures everywhere and realizing it was just 30 minutes from Bali where I was going on vacation this past week. The reviews are accurate - this isn't an easy place to get to, and the climb is not easy either - but the view is worth it. I have never seen a place like this in my life and it IS breathtaking. We booked a tour which included a fast boat from Sanur beach to Nusa Penida and then a driver picked us up and drove us there. We could have rented motorbikes or just a taxi, but we weren't sure and were limited on time so we just got a tour guide. The fast boat was about 45 minutes, and once we arrived our tour guide immediately picked us up and started driving up Nusa Penida to the beach, which was about a 45 minute drive through long, winding, and needless to say bumpy roads. Once we arrived the views were incredible and it wasn't too touristy which was great. We decided to start the trek down, and about halfway we stopped to turn back around. To be completely honest, my legs still hurt 3 days later from the hike (and I didn't even go all the way). The hike down is not paved and has rocks and some wood to help guide you, but it's definitely scary and treacherous. I do regret not going all the way down, so if you have time - I would recommend trying it if you are fit and in shape. For me, it was about 90 degrees and I was absolutely exhausted, so I was scared about going all the way down and turned around even though I wish I hadn't. I would visit this place as a once in a lifetime experience if you are in Bali.

Getting a photo taken at the spot without the fence here though looks a bit dangerous and is a bit of a joke as you had to fall in line as if going to the toilet. The path down the ravine to the beach was closed when we went there and did not look at all safe but a fair few were willing to risk it for instagram. HahaThe place was a bit of a drive but relatively easy to get to with a map and a few directions from locals. Going back was confusing on a motorbike.We got to sample the local mie goreng as well which was surpringly offered at a very affordable price compared to the rest of the tourist spots and Bali.

Nina N,Feb-18,"We did not realise how strenuous the hike down to the beach is, the way down is quite tough going with just bamboo tied together on either side to stop you from falling, I was still a bit sick with the flu at the time and only made it down to the halfway point before becoming dizzy. The climb up was even more hard going and we passed a couple of people on the way up taking a break and dying of thirst that asked us for some water, I would definitely recommend not going in the afternoon, we went at about 3pm and the sun beats down on the walk with no escape from it which made it hard going and I became extremely sunburnt from the hike. I definitely want to come back and try the hike again with a bit more preparation next time.","We did not realise how strenuous the hike down to the beach is, the way down is quite tough going with just bamboo tied together on either side to stop you from falling, I was still a bit sick with the flu at the time and only made it down to the halfway point before becoming dizzy.

MorwennaJones,Jan-18,"We visited Kelingking in January, the off season and most quiet time of year for tourism, expecting to get there and find it largely empty.  After negotiating the treacherous roads by scooter (and I mean treacherous- we witnessed a bad accident only the day after), we arrived to find about 30/40 other tourists there, which is a lot given the limited amount of cliff space.  Lots had arrived in the people-carriers from resorts, which make it easy to navigate the dangerous roads and get to all of the places on the island that, otherwise, are hard to reach.  The beach is utterly stunning and completely beautiful, but be prepared to find it crowded, especially if you visit in the off-season.  There's also a very dangerous ledge that tourists were dangling off for photos!  Also, when we visited, there was a sign next to the path down to the beach warning against going down.  We ummed and ahhed about whether to risk it, but fortunately chose not to, and after doing another walk down the cliffs, I'm so glad we chose not to!  The cliff trails here are very steep, dangerous and frequently involve putting your whole body weight on bamboo strapped to the cliff, so for god's sake, if there's a sign there saying that the path is broken, don't ignore it!","We visited Kelingking in January, the off season and most quiet time of year for tourism, expecting to get there and find it largely empty.

The secluded beach would have been a perfect spot to just relax, sunbake and dipping but do bring some water when you go down, its quite a hike back up.Additional advice - take some photos at the wooden bamboo boat on top of the hill (it's a bit worn out - be careful) or take some amazing shot in the lonely tree.

Meg0603,Dec-17,"Kelingking Beach is amazing. It has been on my bucket list to visit for a while now and the challenging hike down to the beach was well worth it.Most people stayed at the viewing platforms at the top or walked down about 500m to get the beautiful classic shot of the cliffs and water. If you are fit or even just love a challenge I would highly reccomend taking the walk down to the beach, it's an adventure in itself. There are parts of the walk where it is quite steep, almost like rock climbing but they have rocks and bamboo to grab on to and that only accounts for a small portion of the walk.It was a beautiful beach with clear waters. You can swim in the water there (we did) just make sure you know how to swim, there is a bit of a strong undertow and dumpy waves but you can time your entry and exit with the waves.Sadly there is a lot of rubbish that gets washed up on to the beach so if you are planning on making a trip down to the beach I recommend doing your bit and taking a bag of rubbish back up with you rather than just being frustrated with the site.","Kelingking Beach is amazing.

Rizki Putra,Dec-17,"If you have time to spend in Bali, please pay a visit to Nusa Penida. This island is just amazingly stunning. It has multiple beaches with jaw-dropping views, totally worth to visit. One of the great options is Kelingking Beach, or the locals used to call it as Karang Dewa. It is only 45 minutes from the Nusa Penida pier by a motorbike. You can easily rent a motorbike, or hire a cab there. Totally easy.The view was completely amazing, as you can see from many pictures here. However, do not go down to the beach if you are not feeling well. It was noon (around 1 am), when I decided to go down to the beach. Actually, the locals put a warning there to not go down because the track was very steep (yeah, 90-degree cliff) it was just like a wall-climbing without any safety rope, and without any safety guards. Going down is totally at your own risk. Also, consider the time to go down and back up. When I went down it was 1 pm and it was extremely hot and even my sunblock couldn’t prevent me from sunburn. The beach itself was actually very nice, and you can swim and enjoy the view for hours. Don’t forget to bring drinks and foods because there is no food stall down there. But please, I repeat, please bring back your trash up there. If you could, please also bring some other trash there. Unfortunately, there were so many trash on the beach. It was sad to find those trash in such paradise. Overall, the place is totally worth to visit. Take some pictures, enjoy the sun, smell the breeze, and drink some coconut.

piksla,Dec-17,"This place is spectacularly beautiful-- one of the prettiest I have ever seen.  They call it T.  Rex beach since it looks like a dinosaur.  The beach itself looks so inviting and tempts one to climb down to the beach.  Beware though- if you aren't in great shape, the hike is super tough.  Not only is the railing fragile and the slope steep, but there aren't ""steps"" most of the way-- just a path.  It is super hot on the path so make sure to wear a hat and bring plenty of water. I felt like I got heat stroke by not doing so.  Both the descent and ascent take a lot of time so budget accordingly.","This place is spectacularly beautiful-- one of the prettiest I have ever seen.

rosafjeldsoe,Aug-17,"This was by far the most beautiful beach I have ever been to in my life! It felt more like a green screen in front of me, rather than reality. The sand is perfectly soft. I would recommend taking the trail down to the beach and spend a good hour taking nice photos. The hike looks a bit unsafe but it is pretty sturdy, just wear appropriate trainers (do not go bear foot or wear flip flips), it only takes about 30 minutes down and 20 minutes back up (and avoid going when there is heavy rain, because if you slip on this hike you're as good as dead). The place has become super popular on social media and tourists are quickly starting to know where this secret gem is. At the top of the trail, there are a lot of tourists (with they annoying selfie sticks) blocking the whole view and they will not move for you to get a good photo, so I suggest ignore this area and make it down to the beach like the proper travellers. Also be thoughtful not to throw rubbish into this beautiful nature as Indonesia seems to be very careless with their trash, just be thoughtful and throw your trash into a bin.","This was by far the most beautiful beach I have ever been to in my life!

Secondly, maybe the crowd has not arrived so we are more free exploring and taking picture. The road leading to the beach has now been improved.

mollfrog,Jun-17,"Kelingking Beach is about 30 mins from Crystal Beach by scooter.

Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat). I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled).

Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat. I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled. Both the descent and ascent are quite laborious, and the pocari sweat back up top was welcomed gladly. This experience was unbelievable. I would do it again in a heartbeat.
