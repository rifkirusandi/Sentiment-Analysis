Its better to stay in resorts around nusa dua if someone wants to really enjoy. There are water sports activities too. Waves are not that strong because of corals.

Here, the cost also is quite expensive but after a long negotiation session, we were so lucky to get only IDR 1,000,000 for 2! It's a local rate! My advice for those who wants to do the water sports activities, please book in advance via online booking, much cheaper compared to walk in price.

So, our intended location was the beach.  Veronika was our photographer.  She made us feel comfortable right from the start and she knew what she was doing.  It was a gamble on our part because it was our last day at Bali, if something goes wrong, there will be no way and no chance for a double take.  We started the photo shoot in the hotel property and the final setting was the (Nusa Dua) beach.  We posed, walked, ran, jumped, played role and some candid shots at the beach.  Our pants/shorts got wet by the waves but it turned out to be the highlight of the session.  The 6 pm scheduled preview was fun but overwhelming because we had to choose from the 354 shots taken.  Our preliminary number was 81 photos.  We were going to review the 81 photos to reduce it some more but then the male staff interrupted and offered us a deal....the first deal was not good enough and we refused....he sweetened the deal a bit more and we went off tip toeing our way to the restaurant for a special dinner.

Nov 2015,Don't bother visiting Nusa Dua or Bali I don't want to spend my time in a Western Hotel isolated from reality and there is too much developments going on.  The beach when we were there was filthy. Covered in rubbish and raw sewage with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem.

Beautiful fine sand. Water temp was 29 degrees but would warm up to mid thirties when the tide would go out. There is a reef maybe 1km our that protects the beach from large waves and large critters.

I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow.

However, the currents are quite strong and you need to be careful with weak swimmers or children. There are also far far fewer interruptions from sellers than some of the others like Kuta/Seminyak.The first time we visited we paid 200,000 for two sunbeds with an umbrella in a hotel complexes private area. As a result we had no interruptions and were able to go to the hotel for lunch and a swim in the pool if we wanted. To be honest, I think we could have maybe bargained them down but we didn't bother.The second time we paid 50,000 for two in a different area of Nusa Dua and this was on the public beach.

The hotels did not seem very exclusive to me if we could just walk in, without being a hotel guest. - Water was clear. What we did not like: - No fishes at all! No opportunity to do any snorkelling. - There were jellyfishes spotted - watch out or you may be stung by one!- There was somewhat watersport activities but at expensive prices offered by ad-hoc vendors sitting by the beach. My husband enquired for jetski and he was quoted USD$55 for 30 minutes - not sure if this is the normal rate but it seemed quite pricey so we did not go ahead. - We saw a couple renting a kayak and they went kayaking but there seemed to be no regulations whatsoever. The couple were not wearing any life vests which is very dangerous. In addition, we later spotted them kayaking way past the lifebuoys and they appeared to be kayaking on the same spot as the current was very, very strong.

This promenade, especially heading south of hotel Bali Tropic offers nice walks, good jogs or bike rides. Heading north of the hotel, after about 1,5km, you will pass through few dirty and unkept areas, which ruins the walk. There are a few downsides of this otherwise lovely beach-Firstly it is the constant noise of water scooters and fast boats, that spoil the tranquility of this place. We visited in February '16 and the hotels and beaches were quite empty, which suited us. However I can imagine this place getting very busy and even noisier in the peak periods and turning this lovely area into sea of bodies fighting for the beach and sun lounger. The second downside is the difference in tide of these shallow waters . In high tide, the swimming areas (you can only swim in small sections marked by the buoys) is ok but never too deep, which makes is ideal for small children. Also the currents are very weak, making the beach quite safe for non swimmers. During the low tide, in many places you can barely swim- the water level is up to the waistline. Also in low tide you often swim through the algae, which is not pleasant at all. The hotels are trying to clean the beach of plastic, algae and other debris, but sometimes their efforts are not enough. In general, it is a lovely stretch of beach worth visiting and perhaps staying in one of many luxury hotels.

We booked through a local guy who got us a much better deal than if we bought from one of the road side tour sellers. There is no surf - and never will be so that makes it ideal for young kids.The snorkeling is only a few hundred meters off the beach and is great!  It is not the Great Barrier Reef but it is wonderful family friendly reef with 1000's of fish. The para-sailing was very short but loads of fun - even our 8 year old went with a guide. Turtle Island - awesome.  You may be disappointed when you first get out of the boat but hang in there it was the best hour of our trip so far.

The restaurants at the hotel are lovely and there is a reasonable selection of foods. A highlight for us was the breakfast. We would normally head out of the hotel and look for something local. Due to the location of the hotel that would have been impractical so we had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. Although the setting is very similar to other resorts we have stayed in around the world there are a number of touches that make it distinctively Balinese. A down side to the resort is that it is in an area full of gated resorts and nothing around that you can wander out and look at so you feel that you’re tied to the resort unless you want a trip out by taxi . There is a free shuttle to a shopping centre called Bali Collection but it feels like walking round a retail outlet at home. We found it good for buying any toiletries or water that you may need. All in all the resort served a purpose for us. We booked it for relaxation at the end of a trip.

There are dozens of companies lined up along the beach, one after the other, all after your business. They vast majority of them will charge you as much as they can and make the whole process very confusing. The 1st thing you need to do is research your prices. We found some great prices on the Wira Water website and we used them as a negotiating tool. The prices are less than half of what operators will try and charge you. The 2nd thing you need to know is that if you let your taxi or shuttle driver enter the car park of any business, they will get a 5% cut of whatever you spend. Tell them to park outside and send someone off to talk to the various operators until they find the right one. There were 9 people in our group. We negotiated the internet prices with a further 10% off the prices found on the internet and no additional credit card fees (usually an extra 4%). The whole group had a 15 minute jet ski, tandem parasail, banana boat and four people did the flying fish. In total Cost was 2,500,000 IDR or around $250AUD. Very reasonable! Also the operators were happy because we didn’t book it through the internet agency and therefore cut out an extra middle man. Last time we were in Bali we all wanted to go parasailing and booked through an agency in Seminyak. When we arrived at Nusa Dua they told us that it was too windy and they weren’t doing parasailing.

When assessing the Nusa Dua beach I am Referring to the public beach at the entry points where most people seem to stay in this area (and are supposed to stay?).  I am rating the public beach sections. To your left as you come out is the more northerly section to the left, strictly speaking this is Nusa Dua beach.  It is a sand and rock beach bounded by massive, and I mean massive, walls of sandbags to protect the coast.  There is another section to your right that is more attractive and the start of the longer southerly section, which has other named beach sections.  At this end it’s ok but the ubiquitous plastic seems to gravitate to this end, so walk further south.  If you look at some maps the whole beach for the next 4km is labelled Nusa Dua beach, however a succession of hotels adopt each section of beach. So although you are not discouraged or checked you get the feeling most locals don’t penetrate to the far end of the beach which took about a 45 minutes stroll. At the end there is a long curving jetty looking up to the Monastery which is not accessible from the beach.  It gets cleaner and here are less people the further you walk up the beach. Overall a nice beach but I wouldn’t travel from Seminak again to go there, although I would say that it looks cleaner water. I also think it’s much cleaner than the beaches going up further north on the Nusa Dua peninsula which gets nearer and nearer to the port traffic and all the pollutants that go with ports.

At the end of the road, there is beach area for us to relax whilst waiting for our wives to finish their massage. Walking along the beach, I realised that despite all the beach chairs and facilities by the hotels, the beach is actually quite dirty. Seen load of rubbish floating along the waves onto the beach. There was a bar somewhere nearby and we had our Bintang Beer at 35,000 ruppiah per glass. Can't complain on the hotel pricing. The next day, we were taken to another side of Nusa Dua where we wanted to do the Sea Walker but on arrival was told that per pax cost us USD108. I understood from the internet it cost around USD55 so there was no way we were going for it. Instead, snorkeling cost only USD25 so in order to satisfy the boys, we agreed to take up snorkeling. We were taken to a boat which took us out further to sea. On the way, it was a long sad sight to see. Rubbish on the beach and floating on the sea. Dead sea corals underneath! Not so clear waters. Is this the Great Bali Beach we came for? When we jumped out of the boat for snorkeling, the waves were incredibly strong even for an adult, and the tide keep taking us away from the boat. I had to swim afloat just to keep an eye on the boys from straying away. The snorkeling activity was for an hour but after 20 mins, we all decided we had enough and jumped onto the boat. Surprisingly, there is no ladder and not easy climbing up by stepping on the motor engine. Along the way back, plenty of sea activity... jet skies, banana boat etc. How long will this beach last until the sea becomes undesirable one day?

Sep 2014,"We stayed at The Laguna Beach Resort which is on Nusa Dua Beach and were very pleased to discover the bay to be large with white clean sand and shallow crystal clear water.  The bay is protected by a natural reef and is tidal.  Early morning and late at night sees the tide withdraw uncovering tiny rock pools and where you can witness local fishermen walking on the seabed with head torches looking for shellfish etc.If you stand still in the water you can easily spot small shoals of stripey fish - some the size of your hand.

Oct 2014,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore. It was the third time to Bali, so we wanted to stay at a clean and quiet beach, with no vendor bothering us, and where kids could swim in the sea. Purpose was just to relax.We found all this in Nusa Dua, although the area is secluded and the beach could be anywhere on the globe, as there is no specific Balinese taste when you are on this beach. But we knew it and just wanted to experience this for 5 days, not far from home.The sand was clean and blond as well, very nice. We could swim in the lagoon where the water was clear and pristine. There is a promenade along the beach, connecting all the hotels on this beach, most of them of high-end to luxury. The architectural design of most hotels fits well with the nature (wood/local style). The hotel buildings are also usually set back from the beach. So the natural seafront landscapte is relatively more preserved than on other sanur or kuta beaches.Of note, in South Bali, we find most beaches crowed, dirty and full of vendors that are very anoying sometimes. Some may say the vendors are part of the local experience. Agree but when it disturbs you, it is not pleasant at all. As for Nusa Dua beach, only 2 accredited vendors per hotel are allowed to sell stuff on the beach to guests and most of them are very polite and relatively discret.",french family currently live singapore third time bali want stay clean quiet vendor bother u kid swim sea purpose relaxwe find nusa dua although area seclude anywhere globe specific balinese taste know wanted experience 5 day far homethe sand clean blond well nice swim lagoon water clear pristine promenade along connect hotel highend luxury architectural design hotel fit well nature woodlocal style hotel building usually set back natural seafront landscapte relatively preserve sanur kuta beachesof note south bali find beach crow dirty full vendor anoying sometimes may say vendor part local experience agree disturbs pleasant nusa dua 2 accredited vendor per hotel allow sell stuff guest polite relatively discret,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.71, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9501}",0.9501,positive
