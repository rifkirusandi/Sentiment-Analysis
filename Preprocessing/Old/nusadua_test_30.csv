We carried on driving straight, even though there weren't many signs on the complex, but we fortunately came across the public beach. There were loads of mopeds and space to park but if you're in a car it'll be a lot more difficult to find a spot. There were a few restaurants and toilets there and you'd easily be able to walk down to the hotel owned parts of the beach if you wanted to. There were lots of locals there which was great as that's always a good indicator you're in a decent spot.

Jul 2014,"Nusa Dua beach is a gem. Compared to the hustle & bustle you find at the busy beaches of Kuta, Legian etc, Nusa Dua is a calm oasis of peace & comfort. Fine white sand, a nice long & curving bay to the beach, never crowded (there is a security barrier to the entrance) and with a lot fewer sales people at hand. The water is calm, no surfing waves here, blue and warm most of the year. The bottom of the sea along the beach is rocky, so tread with care - or wear appropriate water shoes. Swimming is possible when the tide is right and you can get a couple of hours of warm, calm swimming in this delightful place. The beach itself is very long and you can go for romantic walks for at least a couple of kilometres. There are many 5* hotels along the beach, but they are recessed quite a distance away, so not intrusive at all.

Sep 2017,"So one thing you need to know about Nusa Dua (I didnt know this when I visited) is that in the afternoon time, the water goes WAY in away from the beach line making it impossible to swim in. However, this changes around 4pm in the evening when the water comes back. The best beaches to visit are definitely Geger beach, however it is very crowded and pretty expensive of you dont stay in the Mulia resort. From my personal experience, unfortunately we only discovered this on the last day, is the beach where the Pirate's Bay resort is on. On this beach, not only is it very free and un-crowded, you get the best beach chairs! We had this circle purple beds and they were the most comfortable relaxing beds ever. Theyre not even that expensive. Dont waste you time going to a beach infront of a hotel unless you're staying in that beach front hotel. On the whole, Nusa Dua beaches are definitely the best Bali has to offer.

I was confused to be informed that, by Indonesian law, no smoking was allowed on the property of any hotel (I have been staying in several hotel and resort properties both in Jakarta and Bali which all offered abundant accommodations for smokers in all outdoor areas, including private balcony's and terraces.). Additionally, no mention of their property being smoke-free was listed on their LHW page at the time of my bookingFurthermore, the duty manager, Mr. Falimra Kalmi, advised me that their resort was the only 6 star property in Indonesia, regardless of the fact that no hotel can be awarded more than five stars.   This '6 star' property was mostly decorated with obviously artificial flowers both in the room as well as public spaces.  Everywhere I turned there was signage warning guests of which activities were forbidden. While it's common hotel courtesy to be excused from a contract if an arriving guest does not find the property to be of his expectations, the duty manager absolutely refused to give any type of refund at all whatsoever.

Feb 2018,"When we were at the Grand Hyatt Bali last time in 2016, we were surprised by how much plastic trash was on the beach and in the ocean. There was hardly any (though still some) this time around. The beach is very beautiful and it's nice that it's private for each of the resorts.There are also lots of water activities that you can do. A lot of reviewers have noted that the cost is much higher at Nusa Dua compared to, say, Kuta. This is true--the costs are about double from that of Kuta but if you don't want to deal with traffic and you're already staying at a resort at Nusa Dua, it may not be worth the hassle to go all the way down to Kuta just to save a little bit of money since you still have to pay for a taxi. For example--a 1 hour surfing lesson plus 1 hour of board rental afterwards is approximately 200,000 rupiah (~$15 USD) at Kuta and 400,000 rupiah at Nusa Dua (~$30 USD). A taxi may cost close to $8 USD each way so you're pretty much at the same price. If you're at Nusa Dua, it makes sense just to do the activities there as well.",grand hyatt bali last time 2016 surprise much plastic trash ocean hardly though still time around beautiful nice private resortsthere lot water activity lot reviewer note cost much high nusa dua compare say kuta truethe cost double kuta dont want deal traffic youre already stay resort nusa dua may worth hassle go way kuta save little bit money still pay taxi examplea 1 hour surf lesson plus 1 hour board rental afterwards approximately 200000 rupiah 15 usd kuta 400000 rupiah nusa dua 30 usd taxi may cost close 8 usd way youre pretty much price youre nusa dua make sense activity well,"{'neg': 0.023, 'neu': 0.782, 'pos': 0.195, 'compound': 0.9616}",0.9616,positive
