There is often a lot of thrash on the beach left there by the tides and feeded by the rivers of Bali and Java. Despite the overpopulation and 9 million visitors a year there is no proper thrash collection on Bali. The Balinese even avoid often the paid service there is and throw their thrash in the rivers. It ends up in the sea and the tide brings it to the beach including used pampers and worse. Just dumping in the sea also goes for the sewage. The whole island with millions of people doing there thing right into the sea. The consequences are that survers are confronted with ear infections and worse. The surfers are by the way the only people who can go safely into the sea. Bathing is risky because of the treacherous currents which take every year several people who drown. But it's a nice beach to walk.,nice take walk hot canggu mainly surf without much sunbathing accomodation often lot thrash leave tide feed river bali java despite overpopulation 9 million visitor year proper thrash collection bali balinese even avoid often pay service throw thrash river end sea tide brings include used pampers worse dump sea go sewage whole island million people thing right sea consequence survers confront ear infection bad surfer way people go safely sea bath risky treacherous current take every year several people drown nice walk,"{'neg': 0.214, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.8555}",-0.8555,negative

Nov 2015,"The first time I went to Canggu was in June 2014. It was then still relatively quiet beach (I visited Batu Bolong), especially if you compare with Kuta. I fell in love with Canggu and longed to get back. Now, being back a couple of times I start to see more clearly and I have adjusted my opinion about Canggu.Canggu is used to be covered by abundance rice fields and limitless coconut trees at her beaches, the saying goes. But now it is becoming, pitifully, more and more like her oldest sisters, Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Here and there you can see pieces of rice fields, but villa's at various styles and sizes are becoming the dominant landscape. Surfers come for all over the world to use this place as their playground. Cafe's and Bar, all made to fit the western styles, are in abundance. I do not get this. If you are on holiday in exotic country, why on earth you want to have croissant with bacon for breakfast, mozzarella salad for lunch and spare ribs for dinner? Try nasi bungkus instead at local waroeng for € 0.4 ( Rp. 5.000). Try kopi tubruk (Balinese coffee) instead of espresso. And ask for a bike for transportation, instead of a motorcycle. Perhaps by doing this there is a vain hope that the damage is a little less than worst.The mass tourism, wherein I, myself, also participate, has contributed to the loss of more and more rice fields or to put it more critically, the loss of Balinese' authenticity and its nature.  How ironic the fate of Balinese.

Phew!The sand is dark (volcanic) and the swimming is a bit risky ( lots of currents) however OLD MANS pub is a super cool place to get some food and cold beers and watch the surf.
