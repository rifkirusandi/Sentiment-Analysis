ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"Initially the black sands of Canggu Beach are quite novel. As this spot has become THE place to be in Bali, crowds have blemished what once might have been pristine and serene. Plenty of waves to surf and hip bars to visit - the beach seems to be perennially packed these days."
Cherie H,"Roumazieres-Loubert, France",Dec 2019,"Unfortunately this gorgeou beach was covered in rubbish. The little food and drink places along the edge of the walkway were friendly and if looking for basic food , nice views and cold drinks its a great spot. The laid back atmosphere and lovely locals makes is favourite spot though when visiting Bali. We stay here for 1/2 of our Bali trip. "
Anastasia B,6 contributions,Jul 2019,"Canggu Beach was wonderful and exactly what I wanted for my vacation. I spent three weeks at an Air Bnb that was in walking distance. My criteria: good surfing waves and yoga. The waves: LOVED them. They came in reliably in perfect sets. Wave after wave after wave, and it's a beach break so you don't have to worry about getting killed on the reef. They are long, firm waves, perfect for long boarding. There are enough waves for everyone, and the locals are very nice, friendly, and laid-back. You can rent boards on the beach, or bring your own. The Yoga: There are several yoga studios close by, but I preferred to do my own ashtanga practice before or after surfing, at my air bnb or on the beach.The Beach: Beautiful with deep blue water and a lovely sky. There are stray dogs which will break your heart, but they are not dangerous."
Therese Herlihy,"Dublin, Ireland",Dec 2019,We knew this was not a white sandy beach but the beach itself had lots of rubbish on it and was so noisy from lots of drunk people in the various bars dotted along the front. Much nicer beaches elsewhere in Bali.
Mark Jones,"Lake Macquarie, Australia",Sep 2019,"Always find you will get a wave at Canggu (and surrounds) without as much hassle as the more renowned breaks on the other side of the penninsula...you all know the breaks, but you also know how its not as much fun anymore. (MJ)"
Mansi Reddy,"Chennai (Madras), India",Oct 2019,"After visiting Seminyak in Bali you can definitely see a contrast in Canggu. This is a new and developing neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, bars and cafes. I can see why the younger crowd gravitate here for budget conscious options. Black sand beach with plenty of choice for beachside activities."
Clo,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,"Certain areas are not that tastefullStick to the private beaches as best you can.Feet were black walking from place to place,  Some parts were fab, but just know where to go"
Gavin,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2019,"a great sunset from here, very wide beach front, watch out for the strong currents from here, can be quite rough at times"
Kaye,"Long Beach, CA",Dec 2019,"If you want a super Western style beach, this is your place. Being from California, I was expecting a very special type of place after hearing that Canggu was voted one of the best beaches in the world, but it was EXACTLY like a California beach. All of the restaurants were catered towards Western cuisine, the most unauthentic part of Bali I'd seen in the whole 3 weeks my boyfriend and I were there."
Jenny,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2019,You don't go to Bali for the beaches! Not compared to Australia. its peaceful and nice in the mornings and lots of street dogs hang out and will say hello. Good for surfing but not swimming. 
SingaporeBms,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Wide open beach with very good surf conditions throughout the day.  Ample food and drink restaurants available along the beach.  
Екатерина Паршутина,9 contributions,Dec 2019,"Good just for surfing. Not clean and relaxing. You can take a surf in the rentals points, with all equipment "
Triana L,Los Angeles,Dec 2019,"If you’re looking for the idyllic, white sand beach and turquoise blue waters in a tranquil setting, this isn’t it. If you’re looking for great surfing, look no further. This beach offers lots of beach club options, vendors, seating areas and service for drinks. There are big crowds on the sand and in the water, likely for the perfect waves and party atmosphere."
zakwebb47,"London, UK",Nov 2019,"The beach is very nice, and absolutely stunning to watch sunsets from (highly recommend!). It is great for surfers as it has fairly big waves (probably a good size for new surfers), but for swimming it's not so good, but overall it's good and I would give it 4/5. "
jlct67,27 contributions,Jul 2019,"Canggu was one of favorite places in the whole world! I had read tons and tons of forums trying to figured out which beach town  I wanted to go to and finally decided on Canggu.  I could not imagine going anywhere else now!! It was the perfect place if you're a young professional looking for a bit of night life without the party scene.  Everywhere felt new, clean, and the perfect mix of boho/Balinese culture.  We stayed in an Air BnB right off the main drive but in a fairly quiet space and it was PERFECT.  Walking distance to the beach, Love Anchor, Crate Cafe, and any restaurant or happy hour you could desire.  We moved locations half way through our trip to another city and actually took a taxi back to Canggu on our last day because we just couldn't get enough! This magical little space full of beautiful shops, beaches, happy hours, scooters, and the most magical humans is one for the books.  Grab a cheap beer at Echo Beach Club, a bucket of fries, and watch the sunset to end each day.  It doesn't get better!"
Colmich,"Warners Bay, Australia",Oct 2019,Not sure what the attraction is with this beach as there are so many better beaches to go to and I wouldn't go back 
HolidayDaydreamer,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2019,"I hung around the pool at my hotel as the beach was really average; beach clubs pumping conflicting and annoying music, packs of dogs defecating near the lounge chairs. To be avoided, in my opinion."
Nanamousaka,"Trowbridge, UK",Nov 2019,I will never stop wanting to come back. Incredible for surfing. We went in October and quite strong swimmers but there were many days where the red flags were out for swimmers. The rip tide is so strong. Not safe to swim for weak swimmers or children. Observe the flags and signs first. 
SkiMom33,"Bellingham, Washington",Nov 2019,I loved hanging out here. It is absolutely stunning.  Did some surf lessons and had a great time in general. Amazing Sunsets!!
Linda M,31 contributions,Aug 2019,Fabuloud beach. With lots of food and drink options...comfortable seating is available everywhere and the service is impeccable...wonderful surfing
Monica S,"Joinville, SC",Nov 2019,One more hot surfing spot. Good waves and of course a little bit crowded. Better than spend time in the sand is take time in some of the restaurants and cafes much cool and good view 😊
Popi D,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2018,"Black sands where you can walk for miles into the horizon. Great for long walks and surfing, but I don't think I would swim in it though. The views from above in the beautiful cafe's and restaurants are divine! Also there is a big wall all the way around with the local Graffiti art, well worth the photo's, there are some very talented people out there. Well worth it to see it at least once."
Donal M,"Cork, Ireland",Oct 2019,"Good service from the lounge rental/surf board rental/ bars at the back. Nice laid back staffNot the nicest sand. Looked good for surfing, but that's not what I was there for. Be careful of urchins here because there are several Rocky patches as you walk out into the water that they inhabit. Not suitable for snorkelling, average for swimming. Grand for sitting and having a drink. Beautiful for sunset"
Jay Richters,7 contributions,Oct 2019,Echo beach club has great seafood and is right on the beach! The lobster is to die for! I will be dining there again next time I go there as it is such good food and great value. Cocktails are also great.
Prof. Andrew John y Fernandes,"Valenzuela, Philippines",Oct 2019,The “new” Seminyak Beach already looks older as it is dirty with rubbish and teeming with unmonitored activity. Mediocre surfing beach
Panji Hagarayu,"Canggu, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"There is no doubt, Bali has many beautiful beaches. One of them is Canggu. Nice to visit here. The waves are also very suitable for surfers."
Iliakylie,Singapore,Oct 2019,This is a must go if you come to Canggu!! Especially if you are a surfer or looking to learn surfing! The waves here are cray and super pretty!
Loulou48,13 contributions,Sep 2019,Great surf spot if you are learning.No hawkers on the beach and a good beach to do a walk..quiet busy 
Minzzz,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,The up and coming destination with niche cafes and retail outlet but more laid back than the overly crowded Seminyak with a black beach to lure the beach goer! With good assortment of good class hotel accommodations and villas! 
adriana m,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Jul 2019,We arrived there around 5pm and strolled along the dark sand just enjoying seeing the crowd in the bars along the beach. Many bars set lounges on the beach for customers to relax and enjoy the sunset
James D,128 contributions,Oct 2019,"Quite enjoyed the quieter parts away from the main bars. Surfs cool. Too many people getting caught in rips. Lifeguards just wait for surfers to go pick them up. A Russian group daily doing a fake shark attack taking a bottle of red dye into the water and releasing it flailing etc. Whilst friends film it, including a drone. Apparently this is funny in Russia. They were told frequently that it wasn’t. Quite horrifying the first time I saw it. Go for a walk north if you want some peace. You’ll not find much in regards to bars. But that’s not a bad thing. Having stayed in Seminyak and Canggu 2 years ago. I’d go to the quieter areas north of Seminyak but south of Canggu for a more relaxed cool vibe "
allicat527,"Watauga, TX",Sep 2019,"This beach looked great for surfing! We were only there for a short time, so we didn't get a chance to experience it 1st hand, but there were plenty of good waves and a lot of locals surfing."
dogmakes3,"New York City, NY",Aug 2019,"It’s clear that this was once a beautiful place to visit as Bali culture is beautiful but unfortunately it’s been overrun with Starbucks, drunk tourists, and westerners with no respect.  The locals are still friendly but if you travel all the way to Bali but need to have everything convenience of western life, do everyone a favor and stay home. "
Louise P,"Cabarita Beach, Australia",Sep 2019,After having stayed in Seminyak for most of our 10 Day stay in Bali you can definitely see a contrast in Canggu. Firstly the streets aren’t as ‘clean’ as Seminyak as far as Bali standards go. I can see why the younger crowd gravitate here for budget conscious options. Black sand beach with plenty of choice for beachside activities.Great surf. Can sit on the beach for sunset and drink Bintang 👍🏼😎
Murray H,409 contributions,Sep 2019,"Lots of lounge chairs to hire with shade, or plenty of space on the black beach sand. Big car park small fee on left side end of street. Plenty of small shops for food, drinks, bathers, sunglasses if needed. Lots of surf schools if you're a beginner, everybody very helpful, friendly locals."
Granules2013,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2019,Came to the beach of an evening with friends to have a few drinks and watch the sunset. Pretty popular spot with loads of people with the same idea. There’s heaps of places to find a spot and get a drink thought so it wasn’t too overcrowded.
Erin F,"Wanaka, New Zealand",Apr 2019,Really cool place and vibe. Lots of fun places to sit and eat. Lots of places to lounge in the sun and a good surf beach too.
Nadja M,"Molnlycke, Sweden",Sep 2019,A beautiful beach with a great vibe. However the sand is quite dark and rough (just so you know what to expect) and there are rocks in the water so not the best beach for beginner surfers. 
Barry Sloan,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,"The beaches on the other side of the island are much better. The black sand is not very appealing. However it is a good beach if you want to learn how to surf. Plenty of surfboards available to rent, big car park so easy access "
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2019,"Almost impossible to swim here, high waves and black sand. Wasn’t tempting at all unfortunately. We ended up going to a beach club. "
Tracy D,"Gordon, Australia",Sep 2019,"The surf was so huge & messy most of the time, swimmers would just try to get wet & get out, so they didn't get pulled under by the rips.You have to be fit to surf- the waves can be strong & dumpy. More for short boards than Malibus.It was very enjoyable to sit up in the little surf shacks with a drink & watch the local surf competition - they knew what they were doing!"
Karen P,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019,We stayed outside Canggu so only came to the beach a couple of times.  Very large and super busy but excellent for surfing and large area of sand and good access into the sea.  We hired two loungers and a brolly.Good way to pass half a day chilling
INK,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"If you want to enjoy the sunset and get nice picts surrounding with the rocks, try to choose a day with super low tide and you've got AMAZING view!"
Sebastien B,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"If you are surfing, then Canggu Beach is one of the spots you have to go to. Otherwise, it has no specific interest. The beach can get a bit dirty. One of the issues being the dogs that are wandering and using the beach as their toilets,"
Alina,"Moscow, Russia",Aug 2019,Good waves to serf🏄🏻‍♀️Wonderful sunset🌅Clear ocean 🤙🏻Nice beach and nature 🏖🏝I like this place and I’ll return😉
Debbydoodardar,"Burnie, Australia",Aug 2019,We have been coming to Bali for 25 years and had stayed at Berawa side of Canggu before and loved it there so we booked a lovely bed and breakfast at Echo Beach - big mistake - the accomodation was sensational and we can’t thank them enough for their assistance as we needed to leave Canggu early. Canggu is for young party and beach goers and is NOT for seniors like us at all.  I have never felt so out of place in my life.We walked to the beach through the Echo Beach dirt carpark to be greeted by piles of stinking garbage baking in the sun and a crowded black sand beach full of the young trendies - so not our scene.We stayed 1 night and put up with thumping music being carried in the breeze until early hours of the morning and then headed back to South Kuta where it is a slower pace and where we feel at home.I am posting this review just to let others in the same age group (60 plus - and we are very young at heart) that it’s for young people here at Canggu - party party 🎉 
Amalia S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Not that easy to find a good spotfor use to lay down ourselves in that beach. We have to walk along the end tip to nearly the other tip, nearly reach the finns beach club. Nice place to enjoy with your partner; sun bathing, perhaps not swimming because it's too dangerous! Long walk is the best place to try..."
Jonnytwosocks,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"Again- not impressed.  The place is over crowded, riddled with silly scooters, and has a rocky and dirty sandy beach. The little beach front restaurants are pretty decent but not worthy of more than a 3... Bintan is far better! So is Dubai!"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Aug 2019,"Always teaming with life every morning , some good. Waves on offer here and can get quite busy.Noticed many individual groups cleaning different parts of the beach each morning too."
philipbZ8524BX,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"the Canggu beach is a very trendy beach, virtually no hassle from hawkers. It has a modern vibe and has lovely cafe style eats and bars. very relaxed and hassle free."
Charmaine Forbes,4 contributions,Jul 2019,Canggu beach is away from the hustle and bustle of the bugger cities in Bali. We went there for a week of rest and relaxation and thus spot delight goods. Not once were we accosted by T-shirt sellers. On a number of occasions we went to the Lawn resort and the food was exquisite.
Pioneer826629,"Madrid, Spain",Jul 2019,"Along Canggu Beach you can find great bars, places to do surf and it is not as crowded as in seminyak."
Natalie P,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019,I have always stayed in Legian this time I decided to try different place .. and I love it canguu is so good I will definitely be staying here from now on
Tats S,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,Black sand and dog poo - entertainment plus!! watching people walking along the beach and in the surf being wiped out by large waves. 
chicagochica801,"Chicago, IL",Jun 2019,"The beach is gorgeous.  But there are a ton of stray dogs.  They mostly leave people alone, but it is hard to see.  There are hundreds of surfers.  The restaurants along the beach are great.  Some have music, food and drinks are cheap.  "
emma,World,Jul 2019,"Big waves and black sand, not the cleanest though. More ideal for surfers not swimmers or kids. People are all chilled here enjoying their time."
cl41r3,"Nottingham, UK",May 2019,"Spent a couple of hours relaxing aT Canggu beach. Great little cafes and places to eat, lovely long beach which was super busy with surf schools. So if you fancy surf lessons or catching a few rays whilst watching the surfers. This is a great beach to head to. "
kathy c,"Perth, Australia",May 2019,"We had never been to Canggu previously and took this opportunity as we were staying at nearby Seminyak. the first thing noticed in the journey is the conditions of the road is lesser than Kuta and Seminyak, it is slower and packed, but when you arrive at the beach that is forgotten. It is more a young persons location as the surf is much better than Jimbarin, Kuta and Seminyak the shops are in the proximity of the beach are upmarket and there are very good eating places. they still have their markets and pop ups, but they are a couple of Ks away. No shortage of Accommodation and if you are for a good board surf then this is the location."
Inneke W,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"It’s a nice & cozy hotel. Hotel staffs are helpful. There was a day that my room was cleaned twice. Staffs take off their shoes during  cleaning process. I was disappointed when it comes to pillow. Pillows were dirty full of brown spot, I was asking for clean pillows but still get the pillow with brown spot. It would be better if hotel has spare clean pillow to replace the dirty ones. "
NicoleReimer,"Munich, Germany",Jun 2019,"We love Canggu, loved it 5 years ago and still enjoy the place. It offers everything in a short distance, eg. restaurants (every price range), Spas, laundry’s It is busier and more crowded but you still can find relaxing places. The shops are more like boutiques which is different to former times and there are a lot of new international restaurants like pizza, mexican or greece food.Luckily there are still enough „warungs“ providing the delicious Balinese food."
kimgirbin,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"I came to work at the dojo, and canggu beach was my happy place to do morning and night walks. Makes me want to learn how to surf, next time for sure "
Bernhard B,"Linz, Austria",Jun 2019,"We stayed in Bali for 3 weeks and we always booked Agung. He ist absolutely trustworthy, always on time and has reasonable prices. We can absolutely recommend Agung. His number is  +62 812-3801-4543 You find him on WhatsApp."
JosefaWong,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2019,The beach is very good for surfing but not swimming. There are so many nice and friendly coaches available here.  My son’s coach Yudy taught him so well. He improved his surfing so much after 3 lessons. 
Suzee,7 contributions,Jun 2019,We did a day trip to Canggu Beach & loved it BUT walking to buy lunch we saw a great rate at a money exchange booth on the roadside (big mistake)..  3 men were running it & after I counted the money twice & placed it on the counter while they asked if we had small change.... Obviously while we were looking in our bags the guy behind the counter took a heap of money from the pile I had counted without us seeing!! When we got home we counted & were missing a lot of the money!  We were back in Ubud & no receipt either which wouldn't have mattered anyway!    Our day was ruined & our trust totally gone!     We warn others in the area... It was just a wooden makeshift 'office'on the side of the road... Be careful!     Not far from the beach.. LHS  heading away from the beach
Yoanna S,20 contributions,Jun 2019,"If you're looking for a nice and less crowded beach, you should come here. It's a good place to escape from the busy big cities.One more good thing I found is the food. I especially love the local food. Very tasty!"
robton,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2019,"Having travelled to Bali many times over the last 25 years, we never considered going to stay in Canggu, up and till now. Big mistake !!!! Should have stayed with the devil we already knew, however that not being the case we paid the price. What an absolute nightmare Canggu turned out to be. Certainly not the quiet and sleepy Bali we've come to know over the years. Having rented a fairly expensive villa for 12 days, we encountered nothing more but loud music ( till 3am every morning ) and the roaring motorbikes up to all hours of the night, the screaming and often drunken nightclub revellers making their way back to their backpackers facilities after the nightclubs closed, and so on and so on. Admittedly, our villa was very close to the beach front near the end of the main road, so villa's situated further away from the beach might be more quiet, so be aware where you book your accommodation. If you are young and love surfing and do the clubs this place is for you, but those seeking a holiday without loud music and nightlife then stay away. We certainly will never be back to Canggu, never !!"
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2019,This is predominantly a surfing beach which has volcanic grey sand and often has rubbish along the sand and in the water so we don't swim here. 
ozzztraveler,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Good for walking along, and surfing but not swimming due to strong rips.A few local night bars have opened up along the beach next to Fins beach club."
LUX ESCAPES 🌏 📸,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019,"If your coming here to sunbathe and chill if give it a miss , it's volcanic black sand will get everywhere and can ruin your clothes. There is much better beaches to sit and swim at in Bali. If your going for a walk it's great or just to watch the sunset it's ideal. But white sandy beach with crystal blue water it's not."
mikkel,"Canggu, Indonesia",Jun 2019,Not so impressive but its quite fun to be here. And the location is not very far from my place. Bring your dog and have fun at sunset
tinna,"Canggu, Indonesia",May 2019,"Not very recommended just a standart place, not very beautiful.  I would recommend to go there at sunset"
Joni,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2018,You know this beach isn't so special but it's very fun place to catch the sunset. See it thru yourself
orientdesign,wateringen,May 2019,Canggu is hot at the moment and also for the future. A cozy location on the beach with beautiful sea with many and high waves. A great place for the active surfers.There are also many small restaurants and bars in the area.
hollyjames8000,"Perth, Australia",May 2019,Tropical delight to watch the sun go down and learn to surf. Cheap beach bars or get away from the crowd with a little walk . 
Jodie784,"Chelsea, Australia",May 2019,"A must see beach, the sand and water is clearer here and the temperature of the water is perfect after a hot and busy day. There are a load of casual cafes/shacks serving food and drinks. I had my reservations about them, but the food was surprisingly good. The water is rough, so I would recommend only confident swimmers go in. There is some surfing too. The sunset is amazing. Try to fit it in"
SRD1994,"Swansea, UK",Apr 2019,"Brown sand and very rough sea, strong current can't swim. Perfect and amazing surf - full of surfers. Very cheap sunbeds and drinks, no wifi."
Aurora Ribka M,Indonesia,Apr 2019,"My husband and I came here just to enjoy the evening. This beach is crowded with tourists, but not as busy as Seminyak. Beach chairs can be occupied, but we recommend ordering food or drinks. After the sun began to sink into the night, the beach was deserted and food vendors began to close their outlets. We better prepare the pedestal to sit on the beach to anticipate the lack of seating. Food prices are quite affordable. I ordered a coconut for IDR 25,000 and a juice mix for IDR 20,000. Far different in price if we order menu in Seminyak beach."
mg378,Kuala Lumpur,Jul 2018,"Canggu is the new seminyak! Seminyak has become a little more hustle and bustle latelyCanggu has got it's very millennial feel to it with a young 18-late 20's age group, digital nomads and plenty of al fresco barsFun spots around Canggu would be Finn's and The Lawn for a good mix crowd and great ambience"
Arijit B,"Asansol, India",May 2019,My wife and I visited the beach twice and both the times were disappointed due to the dirt and filth. The beach has dark sand and is seldom( or never) cleaned.There are some shacks and cafes on the beach for sunset views but their food is not worth the risk.A better alternative is the Seminyak beach which is cleaned daily. 
LauraHu22x,24 contributions,May 2019,"If you like to surf this beach is great, good waves and plenty of places to rent boards and get lessons if needed. It's not somewhere to spend the day on a nice beach however, the sand is dirty and rough. The sea is fun to swim in if you like to play in the waves but not have a relaxing time in as it's too rough. "
Elizabeth C,"Seseh, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Great surfing beach but not well suited to children or sun bathing as dramatic waves and rocky foreshore.  Good for wave and surf watching.Cluster of small bars at one end and bbq restaurants at the other.  
Matt_Schulze,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2018,"Stayed in Canggu over Christmas 2018, and went surfing on Boxing Day. Definitely some big swells here considering how close to the beach the waves hit. If a beginner it’s probably easier to learn in Bingin which is fairly close. The benefit of surfing here is that the break is on the beach and not a reef, but just be warned the waves can come in thick and fast so prepare if you stack it to keep copping the waves!The beach itself is pretty good, a lot of rubbish much like Kuta but overall great for a stroll down towards Echo beach. The sunsets here are amazing and great to take in over drinks at Finns Beach Club!"
TheOExpress🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿🇭🇰,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2019,"There was a pretty good atmosphere at sunset here but the sand is very dark and coarse, and there looked to be a fair amount of rubbish too. Still, that’s more of a Bali-wide problem than just specific to this beach I suppose."
Agung,4 contributions,Apr 2019,The place is nice yet the cleanliness is something that need to be look after to. Relaxing place to be for family
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"Canggu is a relatively new 'beach resort' and few lessons seem to have been learned from Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Sanur tourist hot spots. No efficient public transportation system, garbage collection and sewers very problematic, no planning resulting in shops, restaurants and other buisnesses popping up everywhere, especially near the beaches and along the -already very busy- roads. I cycled to Canggu several times from relatively laid-back Sanur right through busy Denpasar. Not really recommended. Most Western tourists rent motorbikes and many stay in hostels. Cheap 16-bed dorms are available. Some make an effort to learn how to surf, which is good, though wave ethics are often not included in the training. Compared to the other side of the Southern Bali peninsula the waves in Canggu are great, but they also bring a lot of dirt to the beach. If you are more into swimming, cleanliness and quietness Sanur is a better place."
Alvilde P,World,Apr 2019,"To much garbage on the beach. It is not nice being on the beach with all this garbage. Otherwise the beach is nice, good for surfing. "
VikSen2223,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,"We visited Canggu (awesome place) for the first time in Oct 2018. Decided to check out the beach as it was walking distance from our Villa. It might be great for Surfing but it is NOT FOR KIDS!  We had 2 toddlers age 3 and 4 with us. The beach sand is black (tiny, tiny rocks that shine in the sun like gems, very pretty but heats up so much you can't really walk on it! it's that hot! Also sticks everywhere and gets in your cloths (our kids rashies still got some of the sand stuck inside the fabric even after weekly washing for a year!) The waves are way to rough! Our house keep told us scary stories how some tourists have lost their toddlers to the sea! I can imagine that as it would take seconds! so i you do visit keep alert!    I must say there was no rubbish on the beach itself! There were some guys you could rent a sun bed from (bargain with them!) also a guy who sold some cold water and  Bintang beer :)   No life guards!"
Ryan Mazure,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2019,"Canggu beach is one of the more popular surfing beaches in Bali. If you want to surf where surfer ettiquite doesn't exist this is the place. Be prepared for people dropping in, crashing and wiping out all over other people. Be sure to wear a helmet if you want to avoid any nasty board collisions "
Chapre29,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Mar 2019,"Good things are that there are a lot of activities to do; surfing, beach clubs, bars, town etc. Beach is not too crowded. What we didt like is there is plastic everywhere and evere day new stacks of plastic... sad for such a nice beach."
HolidayByDesign,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Mar 2019,"This is a really nice beach. Black sand, and some large rocks which have been eroded by the waters, making for an interesting seascape.Restaurants and bars are along the beach front, as you'd expect. "
ron_trenning,Heiloo,Mar 2019,"Møre relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak,very nice restaurants most with a view of the ocean.The sunsets are our of This world"
Thomas,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2019,"Usually this place gets a bit to crowded for my taste but if you go out a little further from the main beach area, you can find chiller spots. There are plenty places to grab a drink and some food around aswell so a lot to enjoy. "
Kasia Z,"Central Poland, Poland",Mar 2019,"Beautiful spot, great for surfers 🏄‍♂️ , drink with the Indian Ocean view or simply for a stroll. Photographers will appreciate beautiful sunsets."
Sunnygirl27,"Caloundra, Australia",Mar 2019,"I have been visiting Bali for 24 years and Canggu is my favourite. Much quieter than Seminyak & Legian. There is a little rubbish in the surf but from sunrise to well after sunset this beach has everything you could want from beach bars, good swell, happy locals and toasted tourists loving life."
LDG,"Secret Harbour, Australia",Mar 2019,"Definitely not the best looking beach , a black looking sand , with rubbish through it , possibly black caused by the volcano ?. Water doesn’t look inviting like other parts of Bali. Had a few waves , hence what must be the big ticket item maybe here .Few bars along the beach , but doesn’t compare to Seminyak.Possibly won’t visit again . "
Samantha De Castro,"Makati, Philippines",Mar 2019,"Nice place to stay if you wanna watch the sunset, people go here to surf too. We stayed at a beach front restaurant so we could watch the sunset without the hassle of where to stay.One downside is going and leaving here. There is a local conflict between Grab/GoJek/BlueBird and local taxis here. It is kinda traumatizing since we already booked a grab, and we were already inside the car when a guy in a motorcycle followed us and forced us to go down. Apparently, grab is not allowed in that area. It was scary since it’s in the middle of the night, we were forced to walk to our hotel, and the streets are already dark. No cars/scooters were passing. The guy in a motorcycle was harassing the grab and kept shouting (we dont know the language coz they spoke indonesian).We are tourists so we dont know where to get a taxi (since there are no taxi around) so Grab is the most convenient way, yet somehow, some of the locals cant understand that. Also, if you choose the option to ride them, it is freaking expensive compared to taxi and grab considering the distance is only 1-2km away. They will charge you for as much as 150k. None of us also know how to drive a scooter so we cant rent one (most of the tourist here rent a scooter to go to places since it’s a lot cheaper, cars could be really expensive here)To the local government of Bali, please fix this. We were two girls traveling that time so imagine how scared we were."
Travelgram,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,"Even though we were staying at a luxury hotel with a great beach, we went to Canggu beach for surf lessons. The beach has all you need with beds and umbrellas for hire at cheap rates, drinks you can buy and also about 10 cafe/bars right next to the beach. The beach is clean and also has a great view for sunset."
apinchofhaze,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2019,It is a great location to watch the sunset. It is also good for first-time surfers trying to just get comfortable with their board.
ducati748af,"Paris, France",Feb 2019,"This is probably the dirtiest beach I've ever been too. So much rubbish on the beach and in the water. Having said that though in my week here I have seen a lot of clean up teams trying to tidy this filth up, that's good to see. But I do have to mention all the stray dogs on the beach that are intimidating. They are not aggressive yet but I won't be long. Makes it difficult to enjoy your morning runs."
JordanMcfal,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2019,Best place to have a drink and watch the sun go down over the horizon. Many a Instagram picture have been taken here.
Darrin D,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,"If you have visited Bali and not been to Canggu then you are kidding yourself. You must visit Canggu. It's laid back, its chilled and the sunsets match anything at Seminyak. The surfers are fun to watch and people visiting here seem to be reasonably chilled. Yes - I must admit that's before about 9pm - might be different late at night but we were early to bed. Great place to visit."
natstravel10,"Mt Martha, Australia",Jun 2018,"Seen many beaches around the world and cannot really understand why this seems to be popular. The amount of debris that has washed ashore and lack of softer sand which beach goers were happy to lay around in was astounding. The surf was okay but you needed to contend with the other 60 people out on boards, a mixture of novice and the more experienced. Alot of rubbish within the area also from the public which was a shame. Awkward to get to and with Bali traffic can take a while. We opted to walk back along the beach to Legian which took 1.15. Easy walk and good to see different venues along the way.  "
Jf_Ruth,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2019,"One thing about Canggu Beach that’s worth the visit is the beautiful sunset. The wave is nice  too, great for surfing. But the beach is not very clean, a lot of rubbish, plastics bottles everywhere... "
Onedaytraveller,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,My honest review about all the beach in bali regarding the sunset is along the canggu area! You could get a very whole super big round sunset! With a nice colour and the sound of sea breeze and a view of many surfers finish their activity and bring the board. Oh my god! Canggu sunset you stole my heart.
Ruth S,3 contributions,Feb 2019,I really wonder how people can think this beach is nice. Walking along the beach is like walking through a pile of rubbish. Just disgusting.
Mark D,"Newcastle, Australia",Feb 2019,"Canggu is a great area, quieter and more relaxed than the hustle and bustle of Kuta or Legian, however whilst the beach offers some great waves for surfing and wind surfing its not great if you just want a swim. Worth a visit!"
CapeTurning,"Iisalmi, Finland",Dec 2018,"Spent here 6 days during Xmas. (if you want to read more on my discoveries on Bali beaches, read my reviews about Sanur and Seminyak beaches, I refer here also to those texts)The devastating plastic explosion here was a shock. And, no comfort did we receive which was the case in Semiyak, from armies of cleaners and comforting words: this is only few days.The Beaches kilometres long full of plastic, and NO ONE cleaning them. The beach shag keepers just waited and let the sea come and take it back.Here the locals don't even say it to last only a few days, but even months, the rainy season. And they directly say it is balinese own fault: the trash comes from rivers, and the rainy seasons lift the rivers to flooding, which empties the carbage into ocean.Ugly, awful.  Update on day 4: Around the Finns Beach Club we found some 300m long streak of beach, which was clean. Maybe the currents had spared this, and would imagine that here they do clean. Update on the last day: Ok, the Canggu beach consist of many shorter strips, my comments concern the area between the Pantai Kayu Putih and Pantai Batu Bolong beaches (according to google maps)."
Adrian B,"Aldinga Beach, Australia",Feb 2019,Have stayed previously in a villa ten minutes out. This time near Echo Beach. The vibe of young people from all over the world is so pleasant after the dynamics of Kuta and Legian
kyliebrown1,"Soldotna, AK",Feb 2019,canggu beach is much better than seminayk. but there is trash from time to time. but more clean. lots of surfers so it’s fun to watch them do their thing. black sand beach which we’ve never seen before. recommend canggu over seminayk beach 100% 
JGSingers,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2019,"I love waves, ocean, sea air, salt water.... But when I visited this beach was a festering pit of rubbish and plastic and river debris (including everything you could think of). Washed up on the sand, creek beds and circling around in the water. Did I swim? NO WAY. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. Hepatitis just waiting to happen....GROSS"
Omar H Ali,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jan 2019,The beach is vibrant and cool with a good mix of crowd. Food and beverage options are great . All together great place to chill hand relax with a nice sunset view .
Ray,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2019,I do not like this beach to chill because is full of tourist and rubbish as well I just go there when I want to surf because I am not a champion.
Young-ish couple,28 contributions,Jan 2019,"This beach is amazing for surfers but not so great for non surfers. The local area is also quite cool as surfers are quite cool I supposeThe beach is nice but the waves are very strong, also there are is a lot of debris like large tree branches on the shore line being moved up and down by the wavesBeds are 50,000rp each and surf boards are 50,000rp for 2 hours. There are also loads of instructors if you want to learn to surfIf you want a nice peaceful beach steer clear of this one, however, this is a surfers paradise "
Raj0608,"Pune, India",Dec 2018,"If one loves surfing, this is the place to be. You can laze around on the white sand beach or can sleep on the decks on the beach and enjoy some mocktails or juices and can also read a book. A must visit"
spensterr,"Fort Collins, CO",Jan 2019,Canggu is a super popular surf beach. Some of the best breaks on the west side of the island...also great spot to catch a sunset and just enjoy watching the surfers tear it up. Beach does get a little tight once it's high tide and it is has gotten more and more dirty with litter since our last visit to Bali :( 
cterrantroy,"Chatswood, Australia",Jan 2019,"We went to Seminyak for the first time in 5 years on this trip and won't be back. The traffic and the people, it's busier than Kuta. Canggu on the other hand is brilliant, it's chilled, you can walk across the road without risking death, the beaches aren't covered in rubbish, you get the same great sunset, and there is heaps of good restaurants and accommodation. "
Surfingfamilyadventures,Michigan,Jan 2019,"I have no clue why anyone would ever go here.  We booked 11 days in Nusa Dua and then 11 days in Echo beach.  We left the next morning after arriving.  I have never seen a beach with more garbage and water that was so dirty.  The surf was nothing great either.  I have traveled around the world surfing and never seen more garbage on a beach.  I would not even go in the water.  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, California, Florida , Mexico all have cleaner nicer beaches.   We have three young children and this place is not kid friendly.  The kids have travelled to many third world countries and they even said this city is full of garbage.  The town of echo beach is full of trash.  Do not go here "
Margaret.Robinson,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2018,"We were staying at jimbaran and we caugth a taxi to Canggu as we had been told from locals to go there.We paid 200k rupias (one way) and we spend almost 2 hours to arrive there due of the traffic.It absolutely didn't worth it!The black sand beach is small, crowded, and everything is overpriced. Kids could not swim because of the big waves.Went to an italian restaurant for lunch and it was just average and they only serves salad as a gluten free option (my husband is celiac)The worst thing happened when we tried to catch a taxi to back to our hotel. Local drivers are very rude and after a long bargain with a few drivers, we paid 450k rupias for the same trip that we paid only 200k in the morning!We only throw a day of our holiday...Definetely not a place to go!"
Eanna57,460 contributions,Dec 2018,Big beach with large waves and black sand. Not great for swimming but ideal for surfers. Do not were good shoes while walking on the beach!! Black sand sticks to and stains and I destroyed a very good pair so lesson learned. Many good bars and eateries to choose from but the beach is disappointing not least for the amount of rubbish that  accumulates and is left lying there without collection.
THOMAS V,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"It has good view, it is a good place to spend the evening with your loved one. It's near the Aston Cungg Beach hotel."
Lee G,"Santorini, Greece",Dec 2018,"Cruising to the beach with a lady hanging on for dear life and your cocoNUTS  in the other hand AND CANggu beach with a  fantastic sunset dead ahead, nirvana is On the horizon! U can’t miss here my friends!"
Lily F,"Cygnet, Australia",Dec 2018,"The Canguu beach area is lovely with lots of surfers and friendly tourists/expats around, and the food/restaurant quality is great! So many areas to sit and eat and drink and watch the pretty sunset at about 630pm. The beach itself however is good if your a surfer but not fantastic for a peaceful swim. The ocean is very wavy with even the shallow waves packing quite a hit and it can be dangerous with strong tides. Wouldn’t recommend taking young children here. Beach can be a bit smelly sometimes too with small river channels coming into the beach along it."
sermar99,"Oakland Park, FL",Nov 2018,"Some times you find some garbage around and you have to cross some little creeks in your way, but it is worth it."
Nadine S,Germany,Nov 2018,Its my first beach i saw at bali. For me its avarage in comparison of Malaysia or Thailand... but i seems to be perfect to learn how to surf. 
Vicky,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Oct 2018,"Was here surfing over the weekend. This beach is clean, have a lot of restaurants nearby and a good view of the kuta."
Nikolaos G,2 contributions,Nov 2018,First time I experienced something like this .The waves are great and surfers look so cool but the Canggu beach is so disgusting.Full of plastic and dirt all over.I am surprised how people like to surf or lay down on this environmental crime.Possitive that I noticed some locals in green uniform try to clean the beach.So bad for Bali and Canggu
paragbpatel,"Vadodara, India",Nov 2018,very quite beach with lovely waves. clean beach with very good properties close by. had lovely time. 
Jordanne,"Dromore, UK",Nov 2018,Beach is clean to a certain extent--no rubbish lying around but dogs are free to wander about which means dog poop which is disgusting. We seen many dogs do this and their owners did not pick it up so always very careful were to walk.The beach has people selling water etc and cafes nearby for food. No toilet facilities. No hose to wash water from your feet. It is a lovely place to watch the sunset and a lot of surfers on the water
Jennifer G,43 contributions,Oct 2018,Canggu the hidden treasure- a fantastic location our 5th visit to Bali and Canggu is our new destination place. Hire a scooter from Big Bike to explore the many cafes- beach clubs- shops and beaches on offer. Experince all the culture of a beach location with the rural landscape. Close location to the hussle & bussle of Kuta and Seminyak on scooter ort by taxi. Relax and enjoy in Canggu
melanieben,48 contributions,Nov 2018,"I absolutely loved watching the surfers on Canggu beach. I walked quite a way along, past Finns blaring noise, found a sunbed and parasol for 50k, a few beers from one of the local guys and a good book set me up for the day. "
toon3466,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"If your staying in Canggu it’s not a bad spot, a fair trip from other tourist centres and old style Bali with open drains and rough roads. Beach is small but the outlook with the volcanic rock breaks and  volcanic sand beach is something different. Lots of new private places being built with rice paddies and cows next door. "
Annalina,"Varberg, Sweden",Oct 2018,Nice beach with big waves. Plenty of places to rent a surfboard. 2h surflesson costs 350 000 rupiah. 
Havingamare,"Leyton, UK",Oct 2018,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to Canggu Beach. There are cool local shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. The beach is wide, not overly busy and great for surfing. A really great place to hang out for a day and into the evening and watch the sunset. Our only complaint about Canggu and the other busy tourist areas in this part of Bali is the  “taxi mafia”. We were followed all the way down the very long main road when I said I wouldn’t pay for the massively overpriced “local taxis” fees. A scooter literally followed us and threw us out of the Bluebird taxi that stopped for us! Simply because they expect tourists to pay more than locals and get quite aggressive when you don’t. Despite being a really great town and resort I would’ve go back for that reason alone. These thugs attitude marred what was otherwise a great two weeks in Bali. The people are generally really lovely which is why this aggressive behaviour came as such a surprise. The police or local businesses should really do something about this abuse of tourists. I expect to pay extra for things in these areas, but I don’t expect to be hassled if I chose not too!"
ndags,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2018,"Nothing fancy on the beach but great place to watch plenty of people surfing and enjoying the water. Great place to view is at the end of Jalan Pantai Batu to the right, a series of little bars/restaurants."
lashasingapore,3 contributions,Oct 2018,"Sand is a little dark, beach slightly unkempt - not a 5 star resort private beach.BUT, shaded beach loungers for rent at IDR 50,000 each, fresh coconut and beer, great eateries all around Canggu (Sandbar, anyone?), public shower (3k) and toilets 92k) right off the beach and fantastic large waves to frolic in, great sand for kids to make sand castles - what's not to love?Canggu is a 20-25min taxi ride from Seminyak (40k IDR)"
NYCTraveler68,"New York City, NY",Sep 2018,"Great for surfing but not the most beautiful beach at all. The whole beach area is a bit unkempt, rough, and not very attractive. It's a great place to surf from what I can tell but not really for lounging around. It's not like the beaches of Riviera Maya, Cancun, Phuket, or the Caribbean. The small town itself was more fun and interesting but don't go here for the beach. "
Bernard William Prætorivs,"Randfontein, South Africa",Oct 2018,"Best place to watch the sun set in Bali. Cocktails available, make sure you are at the beach before 3 in the afternoon."
giarcrendrag,15 contributions,Sep 2018,"Canggu is now hipster central with huge array of eating and drinking options - forget the overcrowded shopping areas, get to Canggu"
dietwee,"Antwerp, Belgium",Sep 2018,"use to be a cool place with relax people, now it's evolving to a hipster place with loud bikes and hollow ego people "
Jan vdw,"Vlijmen, The Netherlands",Oct 2018,"Black beach. Strong waves, easy and relaxt swimming not possible. Beautiful sunset and cheap diner on beach possible. Nice music. 13/10 would go again. "
Cintia S,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Nov 2017,"This is a very nice beach if you dont expect white sand and picture perfect pal trees. If you like caribbean beaches than Bali is probably not for you. With that said, Canggu beach is an awesome place with lots of water sports, beach clubs and a cool crowd. "
charmanemajor,"Tennant Creek, Australia",Sep 2018,If you love to surf this is an amazing beach for you! Every shop walking down the beach has surf boards to rent and a lot of shops offer surfing lessons for a decent price too!  A very chilled relaxed clean beach! Nice to spend a day here chilling out and surfing! 
Hamish07,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2018,"The view here at some of the beach bars is magnificent.  Lots of good surfing going down, the sun setting and all the beautiful people chilling out with cocktails."
KapitiKiwis,"Raumati Beach, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"Grey sand, turbulent  seas, no shells, lots of surfers. Enjoyed watching the surfers, there are many warung with lounges and bean bags"
Leon S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2018,This is an awesome beach. Visited it many times for a young coconut at sunset and for a surf during the day. All of the places to eat and drink are nice and cheap. Its a must visit for sure.
mitchmad1,"Davistown, Australia",Sep 2018,Canggu and echo beach at sunset with a soft chair and a beer at anyone of the beach bars is a must to escape the madness in Kuta 
lourdesalea,"Miami, FL",Sep 2018,"Loved visiting Bali back in 2014! We stayed in Canggu beach, close to the area of Seminyak. Learned to surf and everyone was so nice. Can’t wait to return! "
nikaus21,"Newcastle, Australia",Sep 2018,"We hired a driver for day trip to Echo beach from Kuta. Warning!! Traffic is very bad!! took an hour to get there. beach was lovely, sat on beach and didn't get hassled. "
Ren1211,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2018,"If you want to surf while in Bali, this is the beach to come to. Also a great spot to hang out and lounge in the sun and enjoy the gentle breeze through the heat. Nice views of other parts of Bali in the distance as well."
A_Shifayet,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Aug 2018,"We had visited this place in the last week of Aug-2018. This beach could be recognized as surfing heaven for the surfers. Across the beach there are some nice beach club, where you can enjoy the sunset with a small piece of drink to great dinner."
pizzaguy_88,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Sep 2018,I visited while passing through Canggu and walked along the shoreline and the sand is a little less refined but the beach is nice for surfing. Plenty of restaurants around 
Simon B,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Sep 2018,"Really cool vibe but mix of all ages around. Surfers from my local area (Bells Beach Oz) commonly say about Bali trip “go to Canggu”. The tourist attitude and town feel reminds me of Byron Bay. Yet black sand beach and awesome viewing platforms (Old Man’s & Echo Beach Club) make the whole environment pretty special in its own Balinese way. Why didn’t I try a gap year here ... oh dear, 25 years ago?"
Peteski2016,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Aug 2018,This is a very cool part of Bali just north of Seminyak and it is becoming famous for surfing with its black volcanic sand and it has cool shops and restaurants. Finns and La Laguna are some of the big name restaurants here. Loved it. Great shops.
Yvonne L,"Teriang, Malaysia",Jun 2018,place where you can chill for the whole day. there are quite a lot of bars and restaurant along the beach which worth to try of. 
Familybliss,South Pacific,Jun 2018,"Canggu is awesome don’t miss this little cultural district when visiting Bali!They have heaps of shops, heaps of restaurants, heaps of massages, and lots of accommodation from $1000us a night to $5us a night!Sunsets are incredible too!Make sure you realise no grabs and no Uber’s for pick ups, drop offs ok!Enjoy the beautiful people and the cultural sigmoid this beautiful wee place!"
Malarchy,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo",Jul 2018,Canggu beach is a popular but unattractive stretch of sand on Bali's east coast just north of Seminyak beach.  It is black sand and not at all well-kept.  There are also far too many people for it to be all that pleasant.  Stray dogs are also a pest.The most popular stretch of beach is that in front of the various warungs and bars perched above.  Row after row of cheap beach loungers with parasols are full of people during peak season.  With all the people come rubbish which is not looked after really at all as much of the beach is a mess.The mess is made worse by dogs.  Stray and owned dogs are on the beach and their produce is a hazard that needs to be looked out for.The beach itself is black sand which can be ok but here is not fine enough to be a pleasant experience.  The waves in this part of the world are moderate but even when it did not seem that blustery it was still not possible to enter the water as warning signs were posted.  Even wading in a few yards was prohibited.Hawkers were present but were not overly persistent.  They did seem to spend too longer loitering but were not a threat.Seeing as there are much nicer spots just south in Seminyak it is not entirely clear why so many flock to Canggu beach or why it is considered to be a better spot.  This is an example of the worst of Bali's beaches.
Sam B,"Walsall, UK",Mar 2018,"Highly recommend 👌🏻 - I’d suggest going to this beach around 6pm, grab a beer from OldMans, sit on the beach whilst listening to a local band play & watch the sunset 🌅"
default230820183,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2018,"My favourite, the best place. The totally Uber cool place in Bali. Canggu has some of the best beach bars, like The Lawn and Finns were some of the places I visited. I had my most speechless sunset experience here. Not crowded the beaches here give you more time to be with nature and enjoy its beauty. The crowd on these beaches is very friendly and meeting new people here is very refreshing. If you heading to Bali and have decided on the south of Bali. Canggu should be considered as the places to stay and hangout. "
Tommaso M,"Capo d'Orlando, Italy",Aug 2018,That’s where you want to be in Bali. Avoid Kuta and all the other crowded over-fancy places. This is where you really feel the Island.Nice spot for surfing and to know people from all over the world.
Ajinkya,"Varca, India",Jul 2018,Canggu beach is only for professional surfers. Do not even think of going into the ocean even if you are mature swimmer. High tides are risky and no life guards on the beach. Temperature of water is too low so I did not go in water. Many restaurants on the beach. Grab your best sun bed and beer at low cost and enjoy the sunset and see surfers surfing on high tides. 
Rusky6,"Shepparton, Australia",Jul 2018,"Big surf (definitely not for beginners), black sand and great people watching. Definitely not the type of beach where you go for a leisurely dip as the ocean is pretty heavy along here. It's good watching all the people get dumped right on shore though (entertainment on it's own!!!!). Great spot to get a cheap cold beer and watch the sunset (beautiful). Cool vibes all along from Old Mans and the Lawn down to La Brisa at Echo Beach. You have to get some corn along the beach - it's cheap and delicious."
IzabellazMelbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"If you like to observe beautiful sunset , great big waves, sitting on the beach, drinking cocktails from small “ beach bars”  you can do it . Canggu Batu Bolong beach attracts surfers , travellers, musicians and many local dogs. Relax, sit down and observe. "
Captain_Sloth,21 contributions,Jul 2018,Great beach. Waves were too rough for my 2 year old niece but my 8 year old nephew had a great time. Plenty of cheap beach bars along the beach with bean bags to chill and watch life go by. Great place to spend your rest day in Canggu.
Mark C,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Canggu beach, black sand, giant waves, dangerous. I am from Australia so spoilt for beautiful beaches. Canggu beach is great for surfing but there are few swimming beaches. Luckily there are lots of beach clubs that overlook the beach. Hey Finns Echo Beach, La Biza,  and The Lawn. Beaches are clean. Alwats swim between the flags if you do go in."
Ani C,52 contributions,Jul 2018,yes yes yes. great surf.  great atmosphere.  casual laid back bali....but the developers are moving in. enjoy a taste of low key bali before it disappears as its now becoming trendy all to fast. 
bekwil,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Jul 2018,Great vibe in Canggu; it was a cool place to stay. Less busy on the streets than Seminyak. There was a fantastic variety of places to eat. I would stay here again but just a word of warning it’s not an easy place to learn to surf with a rocky bottom underneath the surf break. 
Chris P,"Caboolture, Australia",Jul 2018,"Our expectations of Canggu Beach were not to be disappointed. It’s kept fairly clean. The ocean is pretty clean apart from the creeks which would have pollutants coming out from inland.  There are many bars and places to eat as you walk around. A must is BBQ corn. There are very clean toilets opposite Old Mans Bar, you just have to pay 2k. "
geekmomtokyo,"Tokyo, Japan",Jul 2018,Beach is great for surfer but watch out if you have you children. My toddler drowned even at a knee deep area because of strong wave.Beach itself was not so clean. Lots of nice cafe. Young surfers would have great time here
azevedosofia83,Luxembourg,Jul 2018,"Canggu beach rhymes with good vibe.If you are a surf lover, this is a must. If you are not, enjoy the beach, the nice restaurants and the shopping area."
Jacqui’s Journeys 🌏,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Murky water, some parts of the beach have rock so not perfect for swimming. Lots ofHomeless dogs around. Good music, plenty of food options and cheap bars around! Busy and lots going on. Come here to be in the Center of the action at the beach / bars. Would recommend simply swimming or relaxing at a different beach though.Great surf for beginners and intermediate! Board hire is only 50,000 IRD for 2 hours - cheap! Would recommend going out at dawn to avoid crowds - and high tide is best for beginners , low tide best for intermediate surfers (because of the rocks/ reef )"
SelineCR,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",Jul 2018,"What a great place , very nice vibe. The people are nice and chill. Very very good food options and a great beach. Watch out for some stones in the water.surfing is what it is about on this beach"
macrules,melbourne,May 2018,"After many trips to Bali this was our first time in Canggu and we loved it.  For me it had a Byron Bay feel to it but with a Bali twist. Fantastic, healthy, innovative food, gorgeous boutiques and bars, beautiful rice paddies nearby, yoga classes if that’s your thing and a very strong European mix of clientele. We stayed in Batu Balong and visited Berawa Beach and Echo Beach.  Batu Balong was the perfect choice for us as there was plenty to do and you could walk if you’re not inclined to ride a scooter .  We’re not surfers but it was fantastic to watch all the surfers out there everyday.  Great experience."
Brian P,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Jun 2018,"Canggu is more laid-back than Seminyak and Kuta and also being next to echo Beach is great for Surfers and the young set. A little far out from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta and if you want the 'cheap' shopping experience - then Canggu is not yet the place. The 'local' taxi service is quite exclusive and you pay up to double the rate for travel than if you were to get 'Blue Bird' cabs - which are 'locally excluded'. We were charged 150,000 IDR for a trip from Canggu to Seminyak but the 'Blue Bird' cab fare back was on the meter and only 70,000.If you don't need to go to Seminyak/Kuta and want a more relaxing holiday - then this area is a nice change and some great villa's here as well as cheap accommodation options for those happy with 'cheap'."
francois s,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2018,Love this beachFar from these australian beach club with loud music and so crowdedBali like we love
AWCostless,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2018,"Depending which side you're on: around the statue of the elephant lots of families, including locals, flying kites, sitting down and walking. Further to the left, lots of small bars and restaurants with seating on the beach, great for young people, good surfing. Further to the left still, larger restaurants, mainly bbq, good fresh food, nice all day around, but especially at sunset. The black sand sticks to the soles of your shoes!"
ClaireBare,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,Canggu Beach was nice. Long stretch of beach from Echo Beach Club to The Lawn and Old Mans. On low tide it was interesting to explore the rock pools. 
ClaytonWatson,"Daylesford, Australia",Jun 2018,We are spoilt in Australia with our pristine beaches and surfing wise this is a great beach as long as you can deal with being hassled by droves of surfers from near and far. There is so much rubbish on this beach and with the black sand it sticks out like a sore thumb. The river that drains out into it is not the cleanest but the only place for kids to play as the surf is very strong and the whitewash cleans up small ones very easily. The surf shacks and warungs along the beach are on the most part clean and offer good food but La Brisa is the only decent setup along here. Development will surely see this area cleaned up....hopefully!
Gary S,26 contributions,May 2018,"we go to Canggu  beach often just to relax and watch the sunset, or sometime just to walk the dog. or go to a local restaurant to swim and eat'"
Fabio Z,"Glis, Switzerland",May 2018,it‘s a very nice place to enjoy the sea & the sun. good place to surf. way less crowded than kuta...
PCU,"Beijing, China",May 2018,Went there without any expectations. It was a surprise and I loved it. Black volcanic sand not very appealing at first sight. Wild but lovely. Great for surfing all day long. Different spots for different levels. It is not a fancy place for posh and trendy people. Great atmosphere and great sunset. 
madre&padre,Montenegro,May 2018,Biiiig sandy beach with big stone whos rise from water. Many nice restaurant and beach club with pool.
SalandPete,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Apr 2018,"Echo Beach and Canggu Beach near Old Mans is getting busier and busier, especially at sunset. Getting up at 530am for a surf makes no difference, it’s still really packed. The locals are making a great effort to pick up rubbish so it’s not as dirty as it used to be. A great place to watch the sunset with a Bintang or cocktail in hand!"
Alison W,38 contributions,Apr 2018,So peaceful and easy to find quiet time especially in the mornings. Great bars and cafes.  A walk from our fabulous villa down a quiet street also filled with fab organic and healthy cafes and yoga studio. It’s so peaceful here. 
Shaun T,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Apr 2018,This place has really boomed since I was here last and really catering to a hipster culture but keeping some of its traditional identity with the rice paddies and local architecture. Next time we come here I think we will base ourselves here as it is good for the family and still has the buzz. 
Andrea A,"Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain",Apr 2018,"Good place for relaxing on the deck chairs or doing some surf.The waves were high in the morning but the sea was calmer in the afternoon.I paid 50.000 IDR for a full day renting of a deck chair.There are many places were you can get drinks: beers, coconuts... "
SeonieNZ,"Papamoa, New Zealand",Jul 2017,"This place is like Burleigh or Nobby's Beach was to Surfers Paradise. Laid back, used to be forgotten, now it's becoming recognised and hipster cool popular. If Potato Head isn't your thin, chances are Canggu is. Hire scooters.Ride around. This is the place to relax, explore, and get to know Bali."
stargazerlily,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2018,"Not a beach to lay at all day. You;ll be asked to buy a sun lounger, and there are nicer beaches in the region with golden sand. It's a surfers beach. "
Stephanie M,7 contributions,Apr 2018,"Canggu reminds me very much of certain beaches in Southern California (Venice).  Lots of hipster (I don’t mean that in a bad way) food spots and stores, surfers, and a cool vibe.  The food was consistently good.  We’re very beginner at surfing.  I’ve been both surfing and bodyboarding in Southern California and I felt it was pretty comparable.  The surf was a little choppy and blown out by the time we got there at 10.  We went back at 7 the next day and it was much better although we did not have time to surf the next day."
User749251,Louisiana,Mar 2018,"The beach is gorgeous black sand volcanic origin, Nice surfable waves, awesome sunsets! The city is bustling with activity!"
Zack S,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,"One of the few beaches we went to not littered with trash, but the beach slopes aggressively so there's not much room for activities. Not many vendors on the beach so you don't get bothered much, which is also nice, and there's several large beachfront restaurant / resorts to hang out in.The surf was garbage the day I was there. There was plenty of power behind it, but the break was super choppy with no great shape to the waves. The broke all over the place and inconsistently - there was not one peak to sit on, it was all over the place. And the wave breaks several times and backs off again, depending on the exact power behind the swell, so positioning is near impossible. The mid break seemed to be best - the outside broke and backed off again too quickly and the inside had too much interference. Might be OK with a heavier swell building the outside peak. It was ~4 feet when I was there."
Tamara4513,"Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Mar 2018,"I knew that its not a place for swimming but I didn´t think that its so croudy. Its nice to walk along the seaside in the early morning or for sunset. Its very touristic, special full of surfer who ignore everybody except themselves-:))) Further up, leaving Canggu Beach there are less people and one can make long, long walks along the sea."
senay442,"Datca, Turkey",Mar 2018,"One of the surfers point in Bali. Sometimes really big waves and it is also fun to swim there. The beach is sand, there are sunbeds and sun shilds to hire, around 5-6 euro for two but it is ok without them also. There is a big club finn beach near and you can enter inside or chill outside on the sand free:)  There are surf rentals. You can find markets to grab water as well . It is one ofmy favorite spot for swimming , safe waves, energic young people around, no plastic in the sea and secure ( you can leave your stuff when you are swimming) not very crowded."
FalafelbarenSthlm,"Stockholm, Sweden",Mar 2018,"Dirty, dirt grey sand. Took a walk along the beach but didn´t even bother to check the water temperature. Construction work along big parts of the beach. There is a few places where you can rent surf boards and sun beds. Canggu is where you go to eat good food, and surf."
kenoo300,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,"Sand is dark and can get hot but had good surf and is great for long walks with a few river crossings and a few spots where locals have setup food carts etc, especially on the weekends when the river mouths especially get packed with local families playing and picnicking, v which was great to see and get involved with."
Sola25,43 contributions,Mar 2018,"good location for waiting n seeing sunset, for learning surfing n sunbathing, can rent surfing board here"
Wanderer596696,27 contributions,Feb 2018,One of the better beaches in Bali where you won't be harrassed while trying to relax or have a chilled surf! Definitely worth checking out and grabbing a bite to eat or a drink afterwards at all the amazing places in canngu!
Lexy D,2 contributions,Jan 2018,"lovely beach, not too crowed, close to heaps of good restaurants and shops, good surfing and lots of nice instructors, close to fun bars, great crowd of people in that area in general"
Hellocapitano,"Gili Trawangan, Indonesia",Sep 2017,canggu is the new bali awesome restaurant  and bars good waves for surfing but i hope the beach will be more clean 
dsulaiman2018,"Goettingen, Germany",Feb 2018,"Forget visiting this beach if you prefer white sands and blue water. This one has its strong waves, just perfect for surfing and for those who like to challenge the nature power, with its black rough sands. No 5 star hotels, which claim it as their private beach, just small local bars and they offer drinks and nice food for quite small prices. I hope it stays like this forever."
ElizabethMcGuire,"Omaha, Nebraska, United States",Nov 2017,"The beach was nice enough. I don't surf, but there were amazing surfers out there doing there thing and it was entertaining to watch them. There are countless high quality restaurants in Canggu and some good spas as well. I had a great time in this town overall. It's disheartening to see the locals living in such poverty aside the foreign population living in abundance. "
Bo An,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Jan 2018,"Should visit, there is a choice for clubs, the water is clear. some of the clubs are quite expensive."
JHEILSTYLE,"Dayton, OH",Dec 2017,"Great beach for a sunset, but there is often a lot of trash after rain storms. Good place to surf, chill and have a beer or listen to music from Finn's Beach Club"
Anastasia N,"Riga, Latvia",Jan 2018,"The beach is quite dirty, but overall it’s good for surf because of big waves. Surf instructors and boards are all around. Not so many people (although we were in low season)."
Svennucsor,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2018,"We were there during low rainy season so it might be totally different in high season. The beach is ok but nothing special for Asian standards. Good surfing I guess, nice waves. Beach suffers from plastic invasion unfortunately. Beach is lined with small beach bars that all look the same and have limited choice of drinks and soso food, no WiFi. Stay away from Finns Beach if you don’t wanna be ripped off while thinking you’re special."
Jessica C,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,This is a very popular beach to learn to surf. The sand is quite dark so hot under your feet. A lot of fun beach bars and great for people watching. 
SuskiQ,Australia,Jan 2018,"I believe it is seasonal but the garbage on the beach was revolting. The water looked grubby but, if you’re a surfer, there were some nice waves at both Batu Belong and Echo Beach. "
marijetta,14 contributions,Dec 2017,"We went there for sunset and it was beautiful..nice wave to just stroll around. Not quite but not crowded, clean. We love it!!!"
clive g,"London, UK",Dec 2017,"Top up on the suncream if you're thinking of strolling along this beach. Watch the surfers, and swimming in marked safe areas. Watch the tide as there a couple of rivers running into the sea and at high tide getting across may become trickey. Lovely sand. Many places to stop for a drink or a bite to eat. All tastes catered for."
escapewithkitty,"Western Australia, Australia",Dec 2017,lovely walk down to the beach some rough weather and rain during monsoon takes the beach away... Still a great place to people watch!
angelinalaura,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"The Beach is not quiet, but clean enough, I entered from the gate next to Finn's Club.It has many coconut stalls, you can pick one and lay down on the bean bag they provide. the coconut price is Rp. 20.000 (approx. USD 1,5)."
Hizonfire,"Marikina, Philippines",Dec 2017,"The surf is probably for intermediate surfers as the swells are quite intimidating.The access stairs to the beach beside Finn Beach Bar is disgusting, since it's also the unfinished/haphazardly constructed sewer heading to the beach. We actually saw a rusty metal pipe from the opening head towards the beach - hope it doesn't hit anyone when the wave brings it back to shore.It seems the main attraction of this beach are the bars and party places around it, since the beach itself is honestly ho-hum with grayish sand and yes, trash littered around.Sunset is supposed to be spectacular but we didn't get to see it."
Elena P,Romania,Jun 2017,"This is a good, nice beach, very close to the place were we stayed. It was a bit dirty and we knew that from the owner of the place, but is a good place to make surf and relax a bit."
PerthYoga,"Perth, Australia",May 2017,"Nice drive out to some of the Northern Beaches. The beach was great, but I'm from Perth Australia so you will never get a 5 star out of me ;)"
darlygraham,"Tomar, Portugal",Dec 2017,"We're beach people and we'd been to several beaches around Bali for surfing spots. From all beaches, Canggu was the best place for it. Beach wasn't commercial, no locals sellers, and the sea was clear. Staying 5 days in Canggu and we chose it as our one of surfing lesson spot and it was an amazing experience.Will go for surfing lesson again!~next time."
TheresaSquit,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",Dec 2017,"This beach is disgusting. I don’t care how much you enjoy surfing, it is literally covered in trash.  So incredibly disappointing. I don’t know how anyone could recommend it.  "
catie231,London,Dec 2017,"Was very happy to be here. I hope  a pick up rubbish on the beach awareness community job starts because it would make the review five stars if there was no rubbish , bins for people to help clean up. It is an amazing place."
Joseph B,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Nov 2017,"What an amazing beach to spend the day. There are nice day beds, good food around the corner and it's nice to see the surfers in the water."
mikejlam,"New York City, NY",Dec 2017,We spend a couple of days at this beach. It was really nice. There were nice bars around and pretty girls to look at.
caddyandbellA,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,The beach is not the kind of place you want to throw a towel and swim but it is very pretty with rock formations etc.Lovely for a stross or a surf
HarryAuke,"Raalte, The Netherlands",Dec 2017,Lots of huge beach clubs and resorts together with some small place to get some cheap food or drinks. Beanbags or beach beds to sit in or lie on and an ideal place to see the beautiful sunset while everyone is in the water surfing. Unfortunately my surfing isn't that good.. lots to learn I suppose!
Scott K,"Sunrise Beach, Australia",Nov 2017,"Canggu beach is a major storm water out pour location , so unless you like wading around in all the filth that pollutes the streets then it is not hard to find somewhere better!Waves were average during my stay but I am told it does get good surf .You have to pay to park, halkers everywhere,  major construction sites on both sides and rubbish all around.I feel spoilt as I live where the beaches are so pristine but I can't help feel if you arrived here for your tropical beach getaway or honey moon the disappointment would  be unavoidable!"
Emm1702,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,Good place to surf. Not very crowded but beach still need some cleaning as it its quite dirty unlike Kuta.
suel442017,"Colorado City, CO",Nov 2017,"It is not for relaxing beach...but the place for surfer. The beach is not that clean, plenty hawkers around"
Coleta A,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2017,During daytime toe beach is soooooo cool with all the surf activities. What a vibes.During the night the beach turns into one big club..... excellent place to loose all stress
Nositha,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2017,"Not the best beach for swimming because of high waves,rocks and black sand. You will love it if you're into surfing. There's parties hosted on the beach which go on for all night and end at 4am, now those are  What make Canggu beach legendary!!"
Rick C,"Peregian Beach, Australia",Nov 2017,"Canggu is rubbish. Seriously, the beach itself is so over-rated. Sure, there’s is a good wave, bu other than that, it is an ugly beach and foreshore. Decrepit looking beach bars, dogs. Honestly, I don’t get it, I really don’t. All the nice restos and cafes are off the beach way up the various roads leading down, but why it is such a hub of excitement is more about the ‘scene’ methinks. Kuta has a better beach, just to put Canguu into perspective. "
jamesadamstone,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"The beach is quite nice but the water is dirty, the locals are very friendly, are lots of hotels and restaurants to eat at and surf schools and surfing but not suitable for kids. Strong currents."
Harrisp6,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"Shops very focused on the under 30 surf women and guys, A few good trendy cafes and only a couple of madssage places. very spread out so lots of walking with little shade as the road is through rice paddies."
Tour81093,4 contributions,Oct 2017,Popular surfing beach with decent breaks.  More accomplished surfers go outside while the inside is popular with those learning to surf and surf schools; can be busy as a consequence.  Super cool vibe though.  
Christian S,102 contributions,Sep 2017,"once a nice hidden spot, now crowded of vendor, pseudochiringuitos dirt, [people asking money also to breath.. only nice? sunset.. still a wow.. "
CassandraVeronica,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Echo Beach was a delight to visit, but we didn't swim in the water. We found Canggu overall a nice place to visit, especially with the cafes and beach clubs. However, we were robbed in Canggu whilst walking on the street to dinner one night. We were 4 women walking to the main strip to have dinner when 2 teenage boys drove past and snatched my friend's bag that she was holding against her chest. They grabbed her, tore her dress and shoved her to the ground. They almost rode over the two women in front of us and then rode off. Whilst this is expected everywhere in the world, we never thought it could happen to us, until it did. Be smart, be alert and be safe."
surfriend10,"Kuta, Indonesia",Oct 2017,Wonderful lifecangu the best palaces for surfGood local food and good prizes Papa enjoy mama happy
Jinooi,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,"The entire Canggu area is still relatively less crowded and commercialised than nearby Seminyak. Worth visiting and taking the slightly longer trip. Fewer shops selling touristy stuff, and many more small boutiques and craft shops that are worth checking out, especially if you are looking for good deals on ladies' summer apparel, beach wear and the like.The beach is also a favourite surfers' haunt especially for beginners, as the surf is not as big and less treacherous than those further up and down the coast.Favourite hangout for the hippie and hipster crowd."
biribiriblablab... .,40 contributions,Oct 2017,"The waves were good to surf, board rental was cheap (50'000). The beach was full of plastic though and also the water isnt very nice here...Some good restaurants though!"
Pier Francesco P,22 contributions,Oct 2017,The beach is good and have a lots of little spot when you can chill drinking a beer and relax for the sunset. You can learn how to surf for 350rps with 2 hours lesson but don't expect quality waves. The sea sometimes is full of plastic but I think it depend on the currents. In complex is a good beach but in the south area there are a totally different kind of beaches.
Bonitatravelblog,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2017,The beach isnt so beautiful but we enjoyed a lot watching the surfers.  We rented sunbed including parasol for 100k roepies.  Nice view and we enjoyed our visit to the beach
Alenka,"Squamish, Canada",Oct 2017,"i surf there all the time, chill people, chill place! canggu in general is one of my faves from Bali!"
seanpurcell,"London, UK",Aug 2017,Great place where many people who choose to make their life in Bali live and surf. As a big meat consume the vegan and vegetarian food is some of the best in the world and restaurants of all types great value. Sometimes easier to walk than take a bike/taxi as much of the area is dissected by canals /rivers which means having to go quite far inland to cross bridges
Crossfitfoodie,"Manila, Philippines",Oct 2017,"40 mins away from the luxury resorts of Seminyak lies a stretch of beach filled with surfers in various skill levels.Much more laid back than Bali's more popular beaches, Canggu Beach, as other reviewers have noted feel more authentic with villas on rice paddies, and eco-centered restaurant and hotel concepts."
John B,"Geelong, Australia",Oct 2017,Lovely quiet part of Bali with great surf and lots of traditional restaurants. Villas back onto rice paddies and hotels very eco- centred. Next area go be developed with a huge InterContinental hotel being built. Some very trendy places to visit.
beyschmidt,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,This is probably the best beach in Bali so far. We went to kuta and it was surrounded by Australians. Canggu felt like more authentic 
shaskify,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"me and my finnish friend just decided to go to canggu beach for sunbathing! it was sunday and a lot of people there from foreigners to local! mostly just chillin by the beach waiting for sunset or surfing! the wavez so good ! since im a big fans of doggo, you'll see a lot of doggos with their owner walking dog and doing some train! ah so cute!!!"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Sep 2017,Stayed in Canggu for 3 days and came down here every morning for a walk along the beach to watch Canggu go about its business.Not the best beach for swimming especially when the tide goes out it's best to learn to surf with many stalls catering for such.It is a good place to catch a sunset though...
Serena d,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"One of my fave beaches on the plant! Echo Beach has black, sparkling volcanic sand and amazing waves for surfing. Many call it the new Kuta as surfers flock from all over the world to catch waves on this beach. If you are taking a stroll along Echo beach you can enjoy a drink or something to eat at one of many bars and restaurants. My fave is called OLD MAN. Make sure you check it out if you are ever on Echo Beach.  To get to Echo, grab a scooter or uber and it is only around 5 mins from the rice paddies of Canggu in Bali."
Frieder S,41 contributions,Sep 2017,not ideal for Swimming due to Streaming and waves but perfect for Surfing / wave-boarding. Possibility for Long beach-walks and having some dinks at the various bars where even beach.chairs are being offered complimentary.
waatphoo,"Phuket, Thailand",Sep 2017,"Maybe this isn't the destination of the most favorite destinations in Bali. But for us this is the most beautiful part we have ever visited. Spending time here is amazing day. See the beauty of the beach, enjoying the fabulous evening view while surfing. A very worthy place to visit."
Whistler_nick,"Whistler, Canada",Sep 2017,"The beach is a little dirty and the surf can be a little packed but when 2hr board rental coasts 5AUD you can't complain. I rented from SandBar and they were easy enough. I even left my wallet, phone and hat in a basket with them and it was safe enough. The Bar sells Bali Hai (sorry no bintang) For about 2AUD and there is live music in the evening. Better Spot to watch the sunset than Old Mans but the ""Bar"" is more of a shack... but thats half the charm. Note: 3/5 stars because it was a semi dirty beach"
Traveler531579,2 contributions,Sep 2017,This place has construction non stop building everywhere. Way over crowded waves if u like to surf. Don't waste your time.
misopiso88,"Seattle, WA",Jun 2017,"If you are looking for great surf, fun restaurants and KILLER sunsets, Canggu Beach is the perfect place.  Easy to rent a surf board and go yourself or find an instructor for lessons. Highly recommend!"
Nicole G,Oakenden,Sep 2017,Very dirty/littered but lovely location. Waves/surf is pretty intense. I wouldn't go in. 😉 lovely sunsets. Going to try the roast corn 🌽   
Jen G,35 contributions,Sep 2017,"The rubbish made the beach totally unappealing and smelly. There are a few nice bars along the beach for sure, but as far as beaches go.... nothing to write home about "
ffthomaz,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,"First beach we went on Bali. Nice surprise.Dark sand, great waves and perfect for a stroll until Seminyak. You can walk for hours and there is a great choice on spots were you can eat and drink. If you see the La Laguna bridge, get inside. Great spot."
DawnAllwood,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,It's not the best beach we spent most of our time at the Lawn Beach Club. Free to get in but you are obliged to buy a drink from the bar at least
arcorace2,"Coogee, Australia",May 2017,"Love Canggu Beach great spot with excellent cafe and restaurants, more choices of shopping plus away from busy Kuta"
FloS827,"San Francisco, CA",Sep 2017,"There's some litter along the beach, but expected in Bali if it's not a private beach. The surf is nice with beginner waves and lots of surf shops opening at 6am to rent boards, have lessons. Shops close around 6:30pm. Surf shops all charge the same price and do not bargain - seems like they all decided on the same deal so they'd all be paid decently. As of September 2017, prices are 50k to rent a board (lots of great selections) and 550k for a 2 hour lesson (one on one instruction). If you want to surf more by yourself you'll have to rent a board again."
Jasmyn M,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Aug 2017,"The sand is black, and it's not the cleanest of beaches, but maybe we are spoilt in Australia. I think there are far nicer beaches in Bali, saying that the surfs great and some great cheap little restaurant shacks"
Elin T,Europe,May 2017,"As with almost all the popular beaches here, they are flooded with people. Too many for my taste. Not fun to surf here as there are simply too many fighting for the smallest waves. Go to another island in Indonesia for better surf experience. "
Justyn Jen Gourdin,"Luxor, Egypt",Jul 2017,I love hanging out at this beach. The surf seems pretty good for beginners. Always good to grab a coconut and hang out in the sun for a while.
justjj78,"Glasgow, UK",Aug 2017,"I loved it, sunsets with a roasted corn on the cob and a large Bintang to wash it down and a stroll on the sand......life was made for these moments.You can walk a long way on the sand, just be sure to keep yourself suitably hydrated 😉"
VinceVW,Singapore,Aug 2017,The beach is beautiful and it is great for surfing. There are many beach goers who are there to suntan or to go for surfing.There are surf boards for rental and also great drinks store overlooking the great beach.
jillziegirl,"Bend, OR",Aug 2017,"I heard Canggu was a popular spot.  Then, when I got there, I would have to add...Popular Spot if you like tourists.Also, the beach, although beautiful, is not maintained - lots of dog poo and general trash.  If the Westernized business owners decide to invest here, there should be some sort of commitment in their licensing to clean up the beaches that draw people to Canggu."
"Dr. Tjoe K. Sugiharto, MBA, DTh.","Canggu, Indonesia",Aug 2017,Best American Cheese Burger with oldies milkshake vanilla as well as jungle fries with melted cheese with bacon crumb.It's really heavenly food.
Codyjturnbull,8 contributions,Aug 2017,"Check out surfers warung for the coldest coconuts and othree for their breakfast jaffle, maybe best jaffle on the island"
Kiran V,Belgium,Aug 2017,"The beach is realy cosy and there is every evening live music. There they sell a lot of things. The best thing they sell are the medium spicy corns which are delicious. The waves are for beginners and medium surfers, but there are also big waves if you peddle deep for more advanced surfers."
Portolana,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"A cluster of small places where to grab a bite and hang out, but right on the beach they are just finishing what looks like a  very fancy place. If you do not surf you can seat very carefully on the huge black rock spitted out from a vulcano  thousand years ago"
VJDee,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Aug 2017,A fantastic place for those who want to hang out by the beach or learn to surf. We spent 2 wonderful days there and we loved every moment of it. Lots of drink vendors along the beach and you can use their beach chairs if you order drinks from them too. Highly recommended. 
nickenhanneleen,"Bornem, Belgium",Aug 2017,"How can a beach not be lovely..? Can be busy (during high season) and includes some good surfing breaks. Next to the beach are some bars where you can eat and drink. Good spot to watch sunset.Tip:Park your scooter a bit before the beach, in that manner you avoid some parking costs ;)"
Beebyontour,"Leicester, UK",Aug 2017,Stayed in a hotel a 5 minute walk away from Canggu beach and had many happy experiences there. There is a good selection of beach bars/restaurants/cafes along the beach front and this beach is very popular with the local/expat Surf community. When I visited I saw some of the biggest waves I'd ever seen whilst walking along this beach. Stunning place to just look out and watch the sea at it's finest. Would definitely recommend a visit!
Jean-Pierre V,"Vilvoorde, Belgium",Aug 2017,Nice vibe all along from Echo beach to Olds Man. Lot of warungs. Huge waves at Echo beach. Cheap food and drinks. DJ & live music on the beach at Sandbar.
Kübra,"Hannover, Germany",Jul 2017,"Canggu is a nice beach maybe for Surfers but not as good as the beaches in southern Bali in Uluwatu. Canggu is a nice area for cool cafes and Restaurants and a relaxed atmosphere, but the beach is nothing Special."
Léanne D,14 contributions,Jul 2017,"Beautiful beach with soft black sand. Not too many people, that was really appreciated. The water was a at a perfect temperature to be refreshing, but the waves were really strong so we couldn't go very far. "
Margalee,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jul 2017,"Clean and beautiful white sands,not so crowded as other beach at Bali,  good waves and offers many good hotels nearby. "
SushiX,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2017,"Nice beach with exceptional sunsets. Big waves and big difference between low and high tide. Excellent for surfing, hanging, bathing n chillin "
PSingal,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2017,"the beach sand was nice - mostly light cream colored soft with a little volcanic black mix here and their, the water had some huge waves - ideal for surfing , they even have several surfboard rentals available for about 50k IDR per 2 hours , and surf lessons beginning from 250k IDR per 1.5 hours. not recommended for snorkelling as visibility is not great, but good for swimming in the beginner surfing area.if u just want to sun bathe they have resting chairs on hire too"
lexeneandrews,"Woodgate, Australia",Jul 2017,"This road is my favorite shopping destination.  Great shops, plenty of places to eat , more laid back and relaxed.."
derbiggyz,9 contributions,Jul 2017,Beautiful place to meet a lot of cool people and to start surfing. In some days there is a very big Party in the Evening. I will defenetly Come back to this place.
Joannes Rhino,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Canggu Beach is bordering a coastal village on the island with its typical black sands of the coastline for this area. The beaches in this area including Batu Bolong, Echo, and Canggu have the necessary surf breaks that are extremely getting popular these days among surfers across the world. The area around the beach is also scenic in nature with well-maintained rice fields that makes it one of Bali’s chosen expatriate regions as well as surfing zone. From novice to experienced surfers, this coastal region offers everyone something of their choice. "
Heather Boom,California,Jul 2017,"This is a great spot of you want beach with waves to learn to surf or better if you already know how (as the waves are a bit more Challenging). A super social atmosphere with TONS of young travelers speaking the beach and parties and there are tons of places to eat and drink! Seminyak is just next door but not as popular so you can stay here and then day trip or even go for a Saturday night if a bigger club is your thing. I stayed at a place just off the beaten path and it was quieter, yet I had all the goodness of canggu a 5-10 minute scooter ride away. Also the shopping is great with lots of trendy places to get in your retail therapy if the sun isn't out;) "
Andy S,"Hamburg, Germany",Aug 2016,"As I wrote before about Bali, this is an other beach that you should visit and also the best place for sunset... it's not too crowded as other beach on bali but it's one of most visited beach"
Gladstone21,"Napier, New Zealand",Jul 2017,"Great surfing here, has a rocky bar which is especially prevalent at low tide. Sandy nearer the beach front. But for swimmers, again especially at low tide, not far off the beach front the surface underfoot turns to tangles of weeds or bare slippery rocks. There is lots of bits of weed floating about making it a bit unpleasant to swim in. Stay ni the pool. The nearby Aston Hotel has an awesome rooftop pool with some loungers sitting in the water (shallow) by the bar. Might be a different story at high tide??? The weed will still be there!On the beach there are numerous Warungs with the usual Indo food, beer, drinks, sarongs, shorts, surfboards and boogie boards for hire and good one on one surfing schools around R300000 Indo for an hour + lesson. "
jasonphoto,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"I've lived in Bali for 10 years now and have to say that I really really miss the old canggu... The hipster surf tourist trap that it's become makes me sad enough to cry real tears. It was so nice back when it was just cows, Black sand, a few little places to eat breakfast, and good uncrowded surf... but such is Bali."
Louise Q,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,A good beach ... many locals come here Great sunsets Not many tourists when we were there (ie none) Walkable to beach clubs for more pampering and beach beds for $$ if required 
Jerry T,"Destin, FL",Jul 2017,"This beach is clean. Nice waves and lots of sand. If you don't want to pay Finns Beach Club  prices turn right, walk pat Finns and there are several small bars with tables and bean bags. "
Claire E,41 contributions,Jul 2017,A great afternoon spent here and a must see in Bali! A little Seminyak!!! Walk to the beach and lawn hotel. Beautiful
Maureen F,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,Beautiful beach and great place to walk. I was able to walk from the hotel (Aston Canggu) to Seminyak - took about an hour but a beautiful walk. 
Hooggenoeg,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jul 2017,"This beach is nothing special, the sea is also quite rough, best for surfers. Rather go to one of the surrounding beach clubs where there are amenities etc."
amrita_77,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",May 2017,Beautiful beach...flooded with foreigners..lots of dogs are found in the beach..one of the best pet friendly beaches.Sunset is spectacular.Many restaurants and bars are nearby..local as well as continental and Asian cuisine is available with loud music.
Diego M,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Jun 2017,Ideal place for surfing (or so it seems). The back sand is absolutely amazing and the whole area is nice to walk. Good restaurants and definitely a place you must go even if you do not sure but enjoy a nice view of the sea.
TropicalLover,"Pennsylvania, USA",Jun 2017,"This is a surfing beach and a great place to watch them. A little rough for kids or just swimming. Black sand and a lot of dogs roaming around so not a place foe siyting on the beach, but more of an attraction to watch surfing."
Tala Halawa,"Ramallah, Palestinian Territories",Jun 2017,"Clean in the morning, gets dirty through the day. Good for surfing, many surfing services are available. You can rent sun beds for the whole day, you'll be annoyed by salesmen/saleswomen, just ignore them. "
idweaver,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"Overcrowded with dogs, people, motor bikes, surfers and nightclubs. Don't take your shoes off to walk in the sand or you may get hookworm like we did. So many dogs pooping on the beach. Not a quite place to come any more. "
KrugerHop,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico",Jun 2017,"Black sand surfing and sunset beach with everything from primitive huts on the beach serving cheap Bintangs, to famous Old Mans, to the laid back ""Lawn"", and at the top end of the scale, the Tugu hotel beachside sundeck.   And many excellent restaurants a short walk up Jln Batu Bolong.   Cool and relaxing vibe."
LorinE-lovestotravel,"Sunbury, Australia",Jun 2017,"From the moment we arrived in Canggu we loved it.. so much quieter and laid back than Kuta, Seminyak and Legian.  The beach has fine black sand with Warungs and restaurants dotted all the way along with bean bags and bars to take in the views and sunsets while enjoying a Bintang or two.  "
lcheney46052,"Concord, NH",Jun 2017,The beach is probably fine for surfing but you have to ask yourself a few questions- what's in the dirty water that drains into the ocean all day long?  Why can't the locals and the hotels help these poor dogs?  They are sick and take away from the experience of being able to enjoy the beach. 
Summa77,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Jun 2017,We stayed a week in an air BnB villa. Was only 150 metres to beach but not once did we swim or surf. The surf was to big for our little fella (9) and I can't say the beach was appealing at all. Echo beach had a surf comp on for the first 3 days too. Not the best timing. However the healthy food options in this area made up for the crap beaches. If you don't surf I say there are nicer places in Bali to go. 
INK,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"If you wanna go here, better in the early morning. cause it will get crowded and the beach is not really clean."
Darren v,11 contributions,Jun 2017,"Canggu beach is very relaxed. Less tourist and normal prices for drink,food and a bed to lay in the sun."
mcclarenk,"San Diego, CA",May 2017,"least favorite beach we visited, we preferred Barawa or Legian. Good for sunset, but very crowded. They sell cheap corn and coconuts on the beach though which was nice."
very-sunny,"Lodz, Poland",Mar 2017,I can't understand why people come to this dirty beach of black sand full of garbage and waste. Except good wave for surf there is nothing else unless you want a drink on the crowded noisy beach . 
16amandaz,"Eaton, Australia",May 2017,"Gorgeous beach but very busy. People everywhere. Can watch from up above at Old mans restaurant, unsure if ok for swimming, may be best for surfing"
919818,"Shanghai, China",May 2017,Good place to catch some waves and do more extreme water activities. Wouldn't recommend it if you're into crystal blue waters. 
Thomas Quinlan,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"This is a black sand beach that's quite near the various villas in Canggu. It's walkable without issue, and the water was the perfect temperature when we went in January. There were a lot of surfers about, and speaking of the water, the thing that makes it a good surf spot - strong waves - means you really must be careful if you venture out into the water for a swim. (We didn't - just meandered down the beach with our toes in the surf that came up.) There's not a lot of cover for those of us that might need some shade, so if the equatorial sun isn't your thing make sure you have sunblock and/or an umbrella. (Those might be advisable generally.) We didn't find too many amenities along the beach, but then we weren't really looking for any either."
Alex W,"Ely, UK",May 2017,"We lived about 10min away from this beach while in Bali. This beach is a black sand volcanic beach so don't expect white sparkling sand and clear blue water, but the beach is clean and so is the water. Lots of surfers which is fab to watch. Finns beach club offers nice drinks and food to sit and watch the sunset too. Fab beach that's not overcrowded or messy"
maleeam23,"Bozeman, MT",May 2017,"This beach is excellent! Lots of surfers and lots of people (Canggu is primarily Australian tourists) but the beach is very clean!! There are some really nice spots to get in the water and play with the waves. Lots of good people watching, and lots of little shops right on the beach with chairs, surf boards for rent and bintang/coconuts for sale. We were staying right down the road so being so close to this beach was amazing!! Highly recommend"
triki997,Western Australia,Jan 2017,Canggu Beach is a black sand volcanic beach which makes it look a little unattractive for us Australians used to white sand and sparkling blue seas. However I found it a really good place to hang out and have conversations with fellow travellers at various bars that line the sand. These range from wildly expensive (Western priced) complete with swimming pools and lovely lounging furniture through to cheap little warnings which offer bean bags under beach umbrellas. There was a bit of surf when I was there and its possible to hire boards. I am a little reluctant to swim in south Bali ocean because of poor  sewage and a big population but lots of people were taking the plunge. It was boisterous sea so be careful if you are a weak swimmer - lots of sandbanks and turbulence. Excellent for big beach walks.
Rebeca C,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2017,"Quiet spots can be found, not too overcrowded with westerners - looked like lots of surf schools in the morning"
Don D,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,Visited Canggu or Echo beach to see the surf and the sunset.the surf was reasonable and the waves were crowded all day. There appeared to be some significant rips and not a good place for the learner or poor swimmer.Good the have a beer in the bars and watch.
Tereza R,"Prague, Czech Republic",Apr 2017,"You can rent surfboards for 50,000 for 2 hours. Easy rolling waves, but gets crowded. There's a good club Old Man's for evening after surf fun."
Rio R,1 contribution,May 2017,Nice clean peaceful beach👍. The deckchairs much more cheaper like in Kuta. The food delicious and the coconuts fresh ancient cold 😃
Ahmad G,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Apr 2017,Not a good place to learn to surf even. As a strong swimmer. No warning signs............ Shoukd have flags at least 
David,"Canton of Zurich, Switzerland",Apr 2017,"We were several times at the beach, visited The Lawn, some beach bars etc. We liked the mood before sundown very much, as there is a friendly mix of locals, tourists, surfers, dogs and cats and the light is indescribable at sundown! Best to enjoy with a cold bintang beer from the many tiny beach bars."
datstar1,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Canggu beach is of black sand and stretches for some distance. You will find surfers mostly from Europe and the United States being carefree and chasing waves. Naturally, you'll also find Australians due to the proximity. As you reach the beach at the end of Jl Pantai Batau Bolong, you will find bars, cafes and restaurants serving hungry tourists and surfers. There are also surf boards for hire. The main mode of transport to get here is by scooter which can be hired almost anywhere or taxi. It is also a great spot to watch the sun set or just pop on one of the sun lounges set up by locals with their little shacks that sell beers and soft drinks and food. The lounges are free if you purchase a beverage with them. At sun down, the locals with their families come and enjoy the cooler part of the day with children playing, whilst others enjoy a pleasant beach stroll and soak in the relaxed atmosphere."
Michael S,"Bilpin, Australia",Apr 2017,"Ok beach says it all. Not great but ok. Has black volcanic sand. I'd prefer sandy coloured sand. But hey, Bali has bit of everything. "
Justine S,17 contributions,Apr 2017,The beach had a fun environment with delicious corn on the cob being sold at sunset.  The waves are too big for swimming with small children.  Good for beginner surfers on the days we were there.
Ketut M,1 contribution,Apr 2017,Nice beach and love this and coming again and with friends and gain wi5h friend clean wave and surfer
Chayen V,"Schiphol, The Netherlands",Apr 2017,Lots of waves on the beach. Perfect for surfers. Not so much for swimming. Lots of cafes and restaurants where u can enjoy the view.  
matusruza,"Pohronska Polhora, Slovakia",Apr 2017,"If you are looking for a place to start or try surfing, go here like we did..  Even it was too crowded in my opinion, we still had a good time. Easy to rent surf and take a guide"
Tommy1501,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Ok beach for a visit. Not really pretty or inviting but good for our teenage sons who love bodyboarding. The day we went was a little rough and probably a bit too rough for them but they hired boards and fins $8AUD for a set and still had a paddle which they said was a good experience. We were able to hire sun beds and an umbrella to sit under and watch the boys for $5AUD each. Personally I prefer a more picturesque beach. 
Lenichik,"Rosebud, Australia",Apr 2017,This was the first time we came to Canggu. Our friends suggested it to go surfing. It had heaps of people out surfing but really sad to see how filthy the water was. The oil could be seen in every break of a wave and even human waste. Not a place I would swim. The beach bars closed pretty early and had a much quieter vibe than other places. Just really sad to see how dirty it was. 
Michael A,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Two teenage sons learned to surf here from good local surf teachers so this will always be remembered.   Though the sand is brown which is a shock for Western Australians, the hangs outs and shopping were great while the kids learned to surf and even though we lived in relative luxury eslewhere in Bali, this was the place our teenagers.  It also had the best and best fun restaurants we visited in our seven weeks in Bali which is saying something."
Tiago F,"Porto, Portugal",May 2016,It's one of the best spots for longboard surfing. It works everyday! The beach is sometimes a bit dirty but the water makes up for it. Hot and with a lot of waves.
Antoinetta B,58 contributions,Mar 2017,"Canggu beach was not crowded and peaceful.  Fun to watch the surfers and cool off in the water.  Only distraction are the several people selling jewelry, etc on the beach.  Approaching you continually with offers for bracelets and other items.  The prices are great and a good deal however, these folks can be relentless.  I learned quickly to ""just say no"" as politely as possible."
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2017,A great. Beach to visit if you are a surfer. A long open beach with some coral to avoid. A lot of locals surfing so be prepared to use your surfing etiquettes. Umbrellas and chairs for hire if needed. Lots of local food outlets as well. 
Briohny R,8 contributions,Apr 2017,Despite the densely populated residential area of Canguu the beach is really pleasant and inviting.  Loads of surfers so enjoy!!
Green_Gabriella,"Miami, FL",May 2016,"I wouldn't say this is a paradise beach, but it is a nice beach with culture and small temple structures in walking distance. A lot of the locals come here and also tourists so it's a mix. Surfers would often be out in the water. I stayed right along Canggu beach for my Yoga Teacher Training and so we would come here often to do Yoga or just walk along the beach. If you are in the area, definitely come by. But if you have no purpose coming to the area, I'd say you're probably not missing much."
davidtjones,"Bawtry, UK",Mar 2017,Cracking food - you order from the wall with menu written on with marker pen! Me and the wife had breakfast bowls which were really good! It was a little slow but also seriously busy so understandable.
Jessi-leigh B,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,"After leaving seminyak we turned heading to Canggu we were stoped by police, this is a known corner! Make sure to always wear helmets! And get a international driving permit from RACQ before heading over also carry small amount of cash just in case police fine you! $30 Aus "
Marquestra | A Quest for Travel,"Montreal, Canada",Mar 2017,"The area has a great vibe but the beach is not a sun worshipers paradise, it's absolutely in line with the areas surf community... Sand is volcanic, water is quite agitated!"
iliyasmd,"Melaka, Malaysia",Mar 2017,"Beautiful Beach, shared a coconut with my wife while enjoying the breeze and ocean waves. Can't find any halal shopes so didn't have any food by the beach, but there are plenty of shopes offering varies seafood meals  with cheap price.. "
Juliahelenius,"Helsinki, Finland",Mar 2017,Dont go there with kids or who cant handle the massive waves. Its good if you can surf (like really well) but not for beginners. Many restaurants near and you can rent a chair. 
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"This place has a soft black sand and a big wave so that you could easily find surfers here. if you walked through this beach to the north, you will find that this beach is connected with echo beach"
Ben M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,We walked to and around the Canggu beach every morning we stayed in the area - has a very different vibe to Seminyak and nowhere near as busy. Lots of Bali dogs to see in the area too.
Opal Bin,"Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2017,"Look, as long as you are not expecting pristine white sand, the beach is very nice. Good waves for surfing, the area is stunning with lots of small bars and restaurants. The area and the beach are nice and quiet and perfect to watch the sun set"
Madison M,"Calgary, Alberta",Jan 2017,"I love this beautiful beach. The sea is not very nice, the beach as well but many places to drink something and watch the sunset."
Trendpunk,"Dauin, Philippines",Feb 2017,"The amount of rubbish is terrible. The place is beautiful, but surfing and hitting bags, paddling into them. To be blunt it was like surfing in a rubbish tip. There are nicer places and I could have hit a bad week. Don't judge Bali on this review! My experience was sadly 1star"
Laine_Leon,"Hertfordshire, UK",Apr 2016,"Canggu is a place where you will enjoy a chill, relaxing vibes by the beach. full of specialty coffee shops and if your a foodie you have at least try out some of the coffee shops and restaurant in Canggu.for a drink out session with friends, I suggest Deus Cafe in Canggu and check out Old Mans for the list of events."
tikimodph,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"Batu Bolong has it all: Many healthy cafes, shops, surf board and motorbike rentals, spas, rooms for rent, warungs, ice cream, night clubs, convenience and drug stores and don't forget the beach!  Probably the most popular beach in Canggu!"
Shakira S,"Munich, Germany",Feb 2017,Lovely and clean beach however during the rainy season expect to see a lot of plastic trash wash up on shore. 
Zackery J,"Fresno, CA",Feb 2017,The black sand makes for an interesting scene. The beach is far and away better than kuta's beach. Surf looks better as well. Good bars near the beach also!!
Bri bri,Melbourne,Jan 2017,"We visited the beach club twice - it cost about $100 for 2 adults and 2 kids to enter then meals and drinks were additional (about $70-100 with a cocktail each and lunch). The kids had a great time on the slides, rope swing and lazy river - the pools were clean - toilets could be a bit better. The food and drink options were good! Was it worth the money - unless you utilize all the facilities- id say no, but it allowed the kids to be entertained while allowing us to relax, read books, do laps or head to the gym.What is that worth to you?? I do think they should include towels in the entrance fee for the price they charge.. "
JohannesAdhi,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,It's a nice beach. Not many people went here but I think soon  will be more to come. Quiet and have nice wafe for surf
Lisset N,28 contributions,Jan 2017,"For surfers but also for just visitors wanting to have a relaxed day, you can enjoy it from one of the clubs or from the small spots drinking a coconut... worth to visit it :)"
Ruth K,"New York City, NY",Jan 2017,Okay so this beach would be good for surfing and nothing else AT ALL! It's filthy crowded and doesn't have any proper seating or spot for relaxation. I'm not a trendy or luxury loving kind of person. I just want a nice beach and a place to put my towel. This one is not it.
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Black sand beach and very quiet...water unsuitable for swimming but you can find surfers here enjoying with average waves...
Harishnee G,Roodepoort,Jan 2017,"The staff here really know what they are doing . Visited a different spa and they couldn't compete to the competence of the staff here.Had a pedicure and foot massage - reflexology done , highly recommend this."
The Brit & The Blonde,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2016,"We've lived in Canggu now for a month and love the area, all the side streets and buzzing around on the scooter. The actual beach though is dirty, simple as that. Its good for sunsets but to be honest its covered with bamboo and a lot of plastic and its very sad to see. Cant help but feel that the restaurants and bars should chip in to pay for regular cleaning, provide more bins, or get to the root of the problem and not sell plastic at all."
monidaly,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"The beach in Canggu is dirty. Very dirty. There is rubbish everywhere, so it is not a nice beach to walk along and it was not tempting to go for a swim there."
Neil W,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"When i first visited Canggu you had to ride motor bikes through the rice paddies and there wasn't a warung to be seen. Now there are all sorts of trendy restaurants, bars and shops. It's got very upmarket but the beach itself remains the same -  black sand and good surf on the right day. Gets pretty crowded but it is a big beach. "
Cecille_DXB,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"It was my first time to try it and gladly, i went to the right place.the waves werent too bad, and the beach has a few cafes and shops that offer to teach beginners. if you know how to surf,.you can rent a board here. there are numerous surfers in the area as well, you can just buy a beer and a meal and watch them hit the waves!"
Siobhan O,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Dec 2016,"Booked a lesson in the first surf school you get to in the Carpark- they gave me a lesson with Yasno and he was amazing, learned so much from him - had tried a few lessons elsewhere with limited success but this lesson with Yasno helped me fix some errors and really get into the fun of it!"
Laura P,98 contributions,Dec 2016,"This beach is not the greatest. Definitely the dirtiest beach I have seen, with a lot of plastic littering the shoreline and the sand. There are lots of cute spots on the beach to rent a sunlounge and get a drink or a bite, but it's a real shame there is so much rubbish everywhere spoiling the natural beauty of the place. Canggu is a great little place and there are a lot of lovely cafes and rice fields just a few streets up from the beach. It's a shame that rapid development of the region has led to the beach being trashed. "
kingey6,"Nelson Bay, Australia",Dec 2016,"Best surf beach probably in Bali..Walk from Kuta,all the way along this beach to Cancun.. Reach lv8 & Finns"
Nzcysi,73 contributions,Dec 2016,Less crowded and touristic from Seminyak. Still raw which I like. Good place to surf. Nice beach and waves. 
Yogi_Kris,"Los Angeles, CA",Nov 2016,"I don't see what the fuss is about. The area is really spread out, so you need a scooter. There are a bunch of hipsters and digital nomads, so whatever charm the area may have had has kind of been gentrified away.Yes, you can surf, but the beach isn't actually very nice. Like most beaches in Bali it's full of garbage, especially plastic! (On that note, PLEASE, think twice before you take a plastic bag at the store and buy a reusable water bottle.... be a responsible consumer.)"
Mal M,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"A lovely beach with good surfing. Plenty of surf boards for rent and a no hassle when it comes to laying on the beach and enjoying a cool drink. If you do not want to rent a beach chair, move a little further down the beach and lay your towels down . Plenty of parking for motorcycle or car. There is also little tent cafes where you can have a cool drink with some finger food . Prices are reasonable . There are also quite a few hotels to choose from and all walking distance to the beach . It always from the minding crowd and if a quiet holiday this is the beach for you , you will however need to take about 30 to 50 mins to go to the town of Bail as the roads are small and packed with motor bikes and little cars . A word of advice , its humid so go in light cotton ware . Enjoy . "
Brendan B,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"I am so pleased to say that the photo on this listing doesn't do Canggu justice in any way. You need to spend time in Canggu, there is so much beauty. For this my first trip I decided to keep it simple by sitting and watching a stunning sunset while eating BBQ corn and Bintang Raddler, then eating more BBQ corn and drinking more Bintang Raddler.Just perfect!"
Nick,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2016,"A nice unpretentious hangout, which is the perfect place to learn to surf if you don't already. Super cheap to rent boards and a big enough break to cater for the 100's people out at any one time. Surrounded by a few cool bars (Finns, Old man's) and good restaurants a short walk away (ex machina, Betelnut). I could spend my whole time here! "
nurse_gail,"Budgewoi, Australia",Aug 2016,Cangu to me is the new legion. With great restaurants beach close by and some markets its worth a look
Rnaat_S,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",Nov 2016,We had much fun on the beach with our bodyboards but trying to surf was out of the question. The waves are close by the beach already very high and powerful so we stuck to our bodyboards. There are almost no hustlers on the beach and it is relatively quiet. There are a lot of dogs but they are sweet and most of them are taken care of by the community. 
Dale g,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2016,"the wave here holds its shape well considering its a open beach break. on the bigger days  , its a difficult paddle. there is a few places to rent boards - so you see alot of begginers in the water but food , beer and plenty of places to visit on the beach. "
DiAplo,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Nov 2016,"Too many tourist people, most of them drinking in the bars wich are located right at the entrance. There is a lot of traffic also wich make this beach ""stressful"" and dirty."
TereRazmilic,"Santiago, Chile",Nov 2016,"Is perfect for learning to surf. In the parking there is a place for board rental and you can take some classes. Here we met our dear friend and teacher ""adi"". If you want to learn to surf, this is your place."
niknak1968,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"I love my beaches and unfortunately this beach we went to in Canggu was not nice at all. I am very spoilt living in Western Australia with our beautiful ocean and gorgeous clean beaches and sand. Rubbish was all around us, ocean not inviting what so ever . Was glad to get off the beach ."
Benadvisorr,France,Sep 2016,its very packed and competitive for space and the ozzy pros take center stage its not a negative as people are free spirited and will help you on you surf ( just don't get in there way lol)
Josh F,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach is different to other parts of Bali and less beautiful than the cliff beaches of Uluwatu or Gili Islands. The swell was only a few feet, but it changes with the seasons depending on the coastline. BOARD RENTAL in the car park outside Old Man's Bar and 2,000RPI parking so boogie boards, short/long surf boards can be picked up for the day to avoid lugging back to hostels/hotels. SURF LESSONS are also offered down by the beach (price unknown) but heaps of guides sitting around so negotiating a price shouldn't be hard. "
johnseminara,"Maroubra, Australia",Mar 2016,Canguu beach is located about 30 minutes drive from Legian in a beautiful spot with surrounding rice fields the beach has black sand that you won't find at most beaches in Bali. For surfers it's a awesome spot with 3 different surfing spots a good left hand break that has some unreal tubes then you have a A frame peak in the middle of the beach that serves up some really nice waves and a little bit further down the beach is a really good right hand reef break that offers up some unreal tubes and long rides. Being a bit out of the way it doesn't get as crowded as some of the other surf breaks in Bali but try and get there early in the morning and you should get in a great surf at one of the 3 main breaks there are also some nice waves to be found around the area just go for a walk along the beach and you are sure to find some waves with no one out there  and if you get hungry after a lond surf there are many warungs to get almost anything that you could want to eat so go and check it out I'm sure that you will have a great surf there.
queen2534,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,"Such shambolic development was a disappointment. After hearing all the glossed up stories of this beautiful spot, it was not hard to see that commerce had moved in too fast. The road hasn't been built to accommodate the mass of motorists and the sea front development reminded me of St Kilda beach in the 50's. All opportunistic grabs at the tourist market. From 2 star eateries to expensive fashion boutiques for heaven's sake. No aesthetics here. Sorry Canngu."
Daffa W,3 contributions,Nov 2016,This place is much chance now come here for first time in last 3 years was feel like rural and i dont know canggu transporm in to fast tourist area in bali 
soniamarietheberge,"Calgary, Canada",Sep 2016,I don't understand the appeal. I'm sure you can find a better beach to surf at. This was officially the dirtiest beach I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of beaches. We stayed one night and left for Ubud.
paranoid999,29 contributions,Oct 2016,"Basically a Surfing beach filled with droves of  people learning to surf. Waves break on a seaweed covered reef and booties may be advisable during low tide. The beach itself is not fantastic, the black sand and litter may put visitors off unless they are there to surf.The Sunset is lovely and just down the street leading towards Batu Bolong beach there are many restaurants doing vegan/raw/gluten free food. There are also many places to learn yoga nearby. The overall vibe is friendly and warm."
peterc1100,bangkok,Feb 2016,"A great place to get away from the hustle & bustle of Kuta or Seminyak. Great restaurants, nice places to stay, surf beach.."
Nic R,22 contributions,Oct 2016,"We really love staying here,  usually closer to Pererenen Beach.  Over there its quiter and calmer,  but still close enough to great eating spots and beaches.  We will stay here again.  "
ChristianneQ,"Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway",Oct 2016,Batu Bolung:  there are several beaches in Canggu.  Visited this beach waiting for husband on a surf lesson. The lava sand beach is basic and caters mostly for young surfers. There are a few basic restaurants serving reasonable food and dwellers on the beach rent out surfboards and beds/umbrellas. Surflessons available. The sea is pretty rough and not so suitable for swimming. There is a small charge for parking. The place does get crowded in the afternoon. If you're looking for a beach holiday this is not the place to be. Very popular among surfers. Locals are very friendly.
Ylann R,5 contributions,Oct 2016,"Really not a nice place to hang out, but surfers did seem to enjoy it. The place is surrounded by litter and stray dogs. Restaurants around serve bland food.On the positive side, the view of the ocean is really nice. If you don't surf you should avoid this place IMO. There are much nicer beaches to see in Indonesia"
JanResnick,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,This is a great beach if you're 25 +/- and into surfing and chasing girls wearing a little more than a string.I'm not but I had a lovely walk.
lilian147,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"Very beautiful beach, especially for surfing.  Nice waves! Lots of surf clubs to choose. My  husband and kids were surfing all day while I was relaxing at the beach or at my favorite sandwich bar, Montagu. The best holidays ever!"
Tania R,Barcelona,Oct 2016,"Changgu beach is a nice beach, great for surfers. I didn't like it that much because I don't like beaches with black sand"
jackpastora,"Den Bosch, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,"Nice beach with tons of surfers, but the beach itself is not accessible by wheelchair due to steep stairs. It's nice to watch the surfers at sunset from the boardwalk and have a drink or bite at ""old man"" bar. That as sort of an accessible toilet for small wheelchairs."
Ayie Jogankz,169 contributions,Oct 2016,"This place one of the famous beach in bali. Lot of surfers come to this beach. The swell was good for intermediate skilled surfers (better with longboard). Lot of options for food around, easy parking, good atmosphere, just buy crowded (it's nothing compares to kuta bali)."
Ramses Sinaga,"Bogor, Indonesia",Oct 2016,Canggu beach is a nice view to spent time with especially during sunset. If you bring car or bike there is parking fee (bike RP2000) and so many dogs around belong to local mostly.
Nagwa H,"Doha, Qatar",Mar 2016,we enjoyed the days at canggu beach.. when thirsty or hungry you can always get what you need from the small bars at the top... you can make deals with them and maybe get your sunbed at a low price.
Olivia M,2 contributions,Sep 2016,"Avoid Canggu at all costs... swamped with trash of the smelly human variety and litter! The beach is revolting. If you want to surf you have to fight for waves and wait along with the hundreds of other wannabe surfers who have no sense of surf etiquette.  The town is revolting, equally filthy and swamped with human trash attempting to ride as many scooters as possible.  Most of the restaurants are talented at serving bland mundane food geared to the trash who temporarily inhabit the area in droves. Loud music thumps during the night and in the early mornings you are treated to further thumping and commands being shouted from the moronic gym instructors.."
Rossie m,3 contributions,Sep 2016,Went to eco beach and then canggu and I personally like more this one as im not a pro sufer but can do my tricks
daniela c,"London, UK",Sep 2016,"People say it's the place beach to surf. You can also just relax if you want to and get a sun bed for 20/25k, negotiate always! Loads of spots that you can rent a surf board and get a teacher if you're interested in learning how to surf."
delta52015,"Senggigi, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"New happening beach in Bali, refreshing and different just hope it won't as traffic jam like going to Kuta, Beach"
dee24malang,"Malang, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"Nice beach. Away from hussle and bussle of Seminyak, Kute, and Legian beach. Quiet enough to let us enjoy a true beach environment where people are there to relax, surfing, and take their dogs (there are somehow a lot of people with dogs) to play there. Definitely not many overdressed people go there just to take selfie on every possible angle and spot. Developed enough that there are quite a lot of nice cafes around."
Stacey C,"Victoria, Australia",Sep 2016,What a place to kick back have a few drinks and watch the sun set....beautiful a little out of the way hidden spot we came across from friends who frequent here often as they live close by. Hidden little wonders of the world 👍
Melbournetown01,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"The place is beautiful lovely village feel and quirky stuff happening all around. Because it is being developed its not quite at the standards of Seminyak etc.. I found out the hard way walking on a footpath that had a drain cover taken off, it was pitch black about 9pm, no street lights or other lightning.. We thought it safer on the footpath than the road, fell straight down the drain.  Oops. This was in the main rod down to the beach. Get a taxi."
HDLBruxelles,"Ohaupo, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"Cool and simple area. No pretention when you compare with seminyak. Nice spot to surf, budget restaurant and hotel. Nice sunsets maybe gorgeous finally"
ENES86,Idaho,Sep 2016,This is a black sand beach that is not looked after. The beaches here are a lot more local so there's no resort picking up the trash. The waves are amazing but don't expect to walk along a pristine beach.
Alessandro F,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"I love this beach, i was go every days with my family, i only ask to peoples there to really take care about garbage and not burn the garbage any where is the area is toxic!!"
chitra w,12 contributions,Jun 2016,Many tourists come here for surfing. Not crowded with people. Good place to enjoy the sun set and evening in peace.
Radita K,71 contributions,Aug 2016,"This beach way much more better than Kuta. Less crowded and more perfect in my opinion to chill, lie in the sand, surfing. Plus you will find so many stalls that sell cheap beers, bbq corn, and meatballs. so many dogs here too, but they are so friendly, so no worries!"
Mylittleglitterbugs,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2016,Canguu is like this hidden gem and up and coming hippie /surfer heaven. The beach is safe and fun for kids. The afternoon is better when tide is out. Lots of really authentic and unique restaurants. Can easily park the car or get dropped in taxi and walk around. Lots it see and do. Amazing sunsets from beach bar with a Pina colada 2 for 1 at 5pm. Gets busy for sunset so arrive with plenty of time. 
423djt,brizzy,Jul 2016,This is a better beach than Kuta. The view is magnificent. Not suitable for people looking for crowd.
Marc Derveeuw,"Maseru, Lesotho",Aug 2016,"Popular beach but the place only developed in the past two years, a few access roads and there are still hidden beaches around. Mostly black sand beaches,"
sflsenglish,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Aug 2016,"Canggu Beach is like a contradiction. It should be a quiet beach, it is described as a quiet beach. So lots of people holidaying in the busier resorts go to the quiet beach of Canggu, which means it is not a quiet beach.Canggu seems popular with younger people who want to enjoy the surf and lounging on the beach, there isn't much else to do there.Take a walk towards Batubelig and Seminyak and you will find some fishermen's huts with some neat Banksy style artwork.There is a nice temple complex adjacent to the car park and the area is being renovated quite neatly.Canggu looks as though it's going to be the next add-on to the already overcrowded ""popular"" tourist resorts, so it's worth visiting before the developers ruin it.Walk about 200 meters along the road away from the beach and find Warung Ithaka, an excellent fusion type cafe."
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2016,A great spot for relaxing. Loads of young people surfing or doing yoga nearby. Great Cafes near by serving healthy options. Like Bali was many years ago. Interesting access to get to Canggu Beach. Loved staying here..
QuickWhitTravel,"Washington DC, DC",Aug 2016,"This is a good beach to learn to surf or just lay out and enjoy the Indian Ocean. My husband and I took a stroll and laid out for a while here. Watch out for syringes (which is why I give this beach a 3 out of 5) and the like, but it's a pretty nice beach otherwise. "
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Aug 2016,Canggu beach is much more relaxed then neighbour Seminyak and still has the surfers vibe. Just off the beach there are several nice bars and restaurants.
Perception1111,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Aug 2016,Great beach for kids to come hang around / make sand castles / fly a kite and just hang around. Just next to where we live and it is a great weekend spot. 
lio69005,"Lyon, France",Aug 2016,"The beach is really cool to surf, even if you should take waves ""far away from the beach"" .Small waves are ok for beginners, but not too young !Surfboards renters are on the parking closed to the beach (50000rph for 2h or 100000 for the day)"
womblewa,"Mandurah, Australia",Aug 2016,"If you like Queensland or WA soft white sand with a pristine and developed shore line, then this is about as far from that as you can get.  Black sand, horse riding, fishing and surfing on a rough undeveloped (hallelujah!!) beach with some great cafe shacks up by the Echo Beach end.  We thought this was lovely.  Minimal rubbish, wild beauty.  Not the Bali of the tourism photos, and hardly any of the tourists (other than surfers) either. "
BastijnvdBoom,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,"Beautiful beach with lots of bars, restaurants, and lounge opportunities. There are some nice walks along the beach which can be hard during high tide, but just follow the water and enjoy all the people and views. You can find beautiful shells and swim almost everywhere. Also, lot of waves perfect for surfing with enough locals renting boards and even giving lessons. Some street dogs are living on the beach but they are very happy, enjoying themselves without bothering you. If you arrive by scooter, you might have to pay 2.000 entrance fee."
herandherdog,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"We walked along Canggu beach because we couldn't get a seat at Finns beach club. It was a blessing in disguise because we had a great time swimming in the ocean. There are lots of surfers and boogie borders. The waves were pretty rough but you could remain in the shallow and pretty much just play in the waves (which were strong) Don't wear a bikini because your bottoms will get pulled off, but you'll have time to grab them ;) the waves are a bit rough if you small children. We walked about 500m away from Finns and found a quiet spot where the sand was clean and it was like our own private beach. The water is clear and clean. We didn't have towels because we assumed we could get some at Finns and ended up just sitting on the fine sand and were fine without them. There are small huts along the beach where you can get a drink and hire a bean bag if you like. Canggu beach is stunning! "
vanessalsl,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"Definitely a good place to hang out when in Bali. From deus gallery to beach clubs and echo n old man's, a weekend is easily spent with the awesome vibe canggu gives"
Donna T,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"More of a volcanic sand rather than your nice white soft sand. Very strong waves so more suitable for surfers, Bit of rubbish on the sand too."
erasmusgrad,"Durham, NC",Aug 2016,"Beach near our villa in Canggu. Great spot for surfers and photo taking. Chilled at a surfside cafe for a light lunch, watching the waves. Relax and enjoy! "
threegirlsgo,"Menlo Park, CA",Jul 2016,"Came to this beach 4 days in a row. Not too crowded, plenty of beach chairs to rent (50K IDR for two), inexpensively priced cold beers and drinks, and occasionally two vendors selling chicken satay and roasted corn on the cob (15K for satay, 10K for corn). Lots of beginning surfers, taking their 10 min lesson and then heading for the water with their instructors. We had Putu (sp?) who was fantastic with the kids. Dragged them out to sea, launched them on selected waves, and let them go. They were able to stand up, each of them, several times, and came back declaring that they loved surfing. Not all instructors were as hard working and diligent as he, so ask for him if you can. He's usually in the last surf hut on the left of the little strip of huts to the right of the temple (his is closest to the temple). Standard rate is 350K for 2 hours. The number and quality of waves is great for beginners, and the water is pretty shallow for those who just want to play. But there are plenty of waves that can be a bit strong, so maybe not so great for very small children. The beach itself slopes down at an angle, which is perfect for getting a good view of all the surfers from the comfort of your padded lounge chair. "
Allan B,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"Surf in the morning and if you are there in July or August, kitesurf in the afternoon. On a big day the waves are head an a half, peeling nicely.There are some good restaurants and cafes near the beach for recharging after a good session"
Guillaume L,"Montreal, Canada",Jul 2016,Great playa. Great to learn surf.Black send and cool waves. We had a lot of fun in the morning hour.
ShannaSharon,"Antwerp Province, Belgium",Jul 2016,"It's so crowded for surfing, even when you get out at first light. And when it gets crowded it gets competitive. I had more fun at other breaks and the beach isn't so beautiful either."
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"One of the great beaches views in Bali. Especially for surfer who like challenges to fight with wind and wave, this place is the right one for you. Mostly foreigners there, drying their body by laying down along the beach. Seen local people played huge kites flying in the water with surfing board."
HansK774,"Boskoop, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,As Semanyak had become more busy Bali lovers know to find Canggu and its beach.Also Canggu gets busier as we compare through the years but that leads also to more bars and restaurants.Not only for surf folks but beach lovers van make long walks.
George V,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Really enjoyed this beach. Did surf lessons (ask for Peris) with my 8yr old girl and also body surfing. Note this is a real surf beach and not for toddlers or weak swimmers.Great surf scene best in Bali.
Thewillys10,Papamoa Beach,Jul 2016,All I can say is it is magic! Gotta visit this place and enjoy the amazing sunset!! Great little spots along the beach to enjoy drinks and meals at very cheap prices! 
Pado P,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"First time to cangguNO NEED TO PAY ENTRACEYou just have to pay parking fee at IDR 5.000 for car and IDR 2.000 for motor, shower IDR 5.000/person, toilet IDR 2.000/personCoconut only IDR 15.000Surf lesson around IDR 200.000 a 350.000 depend how good you negotiateNo sellers force you to buy thingsHope this clean peace beach will longlast"
Chlotier,"London, UK",Jun 2016,"Went here for the day on a trip with family, was recommended by one of the locals and was brilliant. There is a massive bar/hut where you can chill and directly opposite is a surf school that allows you to rent a board for £15 for an hour and a half. I had IMAN TAUFIK and was so impressed with his tuition, he was really encouraging and I picked it up quickly. Very unspoilt and beautiful, the sea is great for surfing as the sea bed is just pure sand."
Sophie,"Wodonga, Australia",Jul 2016,"Unless you are a surfer or a stray dog Canggu beach doesn't have much to offer. The sand is polluted with constant rubbish and I didn't feel comfortable walking with bare feet. We used the Canggu Beach front as a quick path to get from Canggu (where our villa was) to Echo Beach. Canggu beach also seems to be a popular hangout spot for stray dogs, they never caused us any issues though (other than there mess). "
Andresguia,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Canggu beach is my favorite beach as it is only 3 km or so from my house and from my childhood I with my friends we used to go there to enjoy the long black sandy beach to be our playground. Today it still has the magic but not more a quiet fishing village like before. Now sprung so many restaurants and cafes and shops and motorbike rentals and money changers along the way to the beach. Sometimes it is very difficult to find a parking space near the beach and there is a parking cost now. If you look for serenity, avoid coming on weekends when it is crowded with all food charts selling local delicacies to locals coming to swim in the shallow waters or to sit down and see the world goes by eating your grilled corn or chopped spring rolls or having your meat balls soup on the beach with your loved ones. The black sundy beach is nice and it is a long beach with big waves for surfers."
Jessi S,"Bellingen, Australia",Jun 2016,Simple town.. for now. developing rapidly. Great views of ocean and surf. Old mans bar is too easy to roll into after a day on beach. Sleepy town away from busyiness. 
Jess K,"Nagambie, Australia",Jun 2016,"I really enjoy going to this beach, it's a lot less 'touristy' than Seminyak, Legian, Kuta. The surf is great even if it can get a bit packed out on the waves. There's heaps of little local warung a selling cheap food, coconuts and cold beers. All very nice and casual the way Bali used to be a long time ago."
FrequentFlier651216,3 contributions,Jun 2016,"Canggu has been my first stop in Bali so far and from what I read this is supposed to be less crowded than other areas. The first day I was here I counted 120 surfers at old man's and everyone dropping in on each other. Really crowded line ups.Local surf instructors will literally push their customers into your path on the wave (and into each other. I seen one student get her nose split open, was inevitable). This place is super busy.Down at echo seems a little less crowded but expect 15 - 30 on each peak. Despite this, it has some really nice peaks. There is a really nice left outside echo beach club which doesn't seem to get as crowded as everywhere else.There are plenty of Warungs and the quality of food is very good and very reasonably priced but expect to pay more than areas away from the beach.Beach itself can be dirty in spots and be careful when walking the beaches. There was plenty of broken bottles on the way from old man's heading south to Berewa. "
Isabella K,20 contributions,Jun 2016,"beginners often start their surf career at this beach. sunset really amazing. More warungs, old man's close and many ladies selling sarong and bracelettes. "
Maria J,"Mississauga, Canada",Dec 2015,"If you want to stay off the beaten path and away from many tourists during the holidays, Canggu Beach was perfect. There were enough hotels ranging from 3-5 stars that you could easily find one within your budget.  We were able to find a mix of authentic Bali eats, things to do and get our photo ops in while at the same time, be minutes from luxury. "
Fuseek,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,Just another beach. There's a toll guy just before you hit the sand (or tourist scammer depends on your perspective) the hotel that adjacent to the entry is enormous but very cool hit design and looks amazing inside.
ankita_petiwale,"Mumbai, India",May 2016,The Batu Bolong area on Canguu beach is very lively and lined with good cafes! You can meet interesting people and have conversations over food! 
Vany V,15 contributions,May 2016,"For surfers, Canggu beach has tides that last long. The currents pull you out very quickly, and it would be very tiring to go back, but it was a nice experience with nice people! "
Maria S,"Markham, Canada",May 2016,"Canggu beach is a very beautiful yet quite beach.. It took a about 45 minutes to reach from Kuta beach due to the heavy traffic. Once you are there, its really different from Kuta beach which is sometimes over crowded..unfortunately it has black sands. Its now have some restaurant and coffee shop . Its good  to visit before it gets over crowded"
cdv2015,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,We spent an easygoing afternoon enjoy the place. Many surfers are practising which offers a very pleasant attraction all over the day.
Acebeer,"Cape Town, South Africa",May 2016,"Enjoyed the surf so hanged around for a week or so. It is not Kuta (which is awesome). It is my kind of place, but can see how others might not agree."
seb levaillant,"Paris, France",Apr 2016,Great spot to drink a beer while watching sunsets and surfers! Sometimes too many dogs hanging on the beach but they dont cause much troubles.
andokelli,"Launceston, Australia",May 2015,"Nice beach, but typical for a lot of Indo has a fair bit of rubbish. Good surf spot, probably better for intermediates upwards as it can get crazy. Good bars, cafes and restaurants within walking distance"
Robert M,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Apr 2016,Great beach for a visit. Surf variable to suit all tastes. Some attention from hawkers but  responded to firm response. Food and drink readily available. Pleasant day out. 
Lauren H,"Indianapolis, IN",Apr 2016,"This was my favorite beach on this coast. Very laid back vibes. Great waves, atmosphere, and beach bars. I would've loved to spend more time at this beach!"
Mary,"Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand",Mar 2016,"I spent a sunset here on my own, I felt safe. What I liked was that there were so many locals enjoying the last of the sun and the beach. I sat and had a coke and soaked it all in."
Maya L,9 contributions,Apr 2016,"Nice place for bring friends here and nice cafe arrounds make us easy  if hungry and find some food here ,will come here again"
Maria Z,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,It's a bit hard to get there from Seminyak but it's worth the trek. The taxis have a hard time getting there because the sneaky shortcut to get in is usually patrolled by police ( should be one way only) So in order to get there from Seminyak its a good 20 minute cab ride. Seems the surfers love it and the ambiance of the area is very surfer cool. No tourist busses here. Phew!The sand is dark (volcanic) and the swimming is a bit risky ( lots of currents) however OLD MANS pub is a super cool place to get some food and cold beers and watch the surf. Occasionally there are street markets in the car park and there's live music most nights at OLD MANS.An up and coming part of South bali and worth the visit
DaveR,"Como, Australia",Apr 2016,"We walked along this morning from Ecco up to Legian. Definately a lovely beach to stroll along, especially early in the morning when not too hot. Watch out for some of the waves that thump their way in, and try to knock you over. Able to swim here and yes it is super refreshing , do watch the currents though, very strong. Kids need to be closely watched before they float away. Water is nice and clean.  A great place to get lessons for surfing or if you have mastered it...go nuts, amazing action out there."
artys_facts,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,This beach is the best place to build your surfing confidence. There are plenty of businesses on and close to the beach to get an advise or a guide person or simply rent a surf board of your like. Beginners can start with a soft board and move to use a hard board next day under the supervision of a local surfing guide/instructor. Most of the guides are great and you can book them day after day if you liked the way they look after you. The beach is better for surfing than having a bath with kids as the waves seem to never stop.
layaputhih,8 contributions,Dec 2015,"The local charge us when we get in, its normal, but the local community should do something for cleaning. You can see many rubbish on this beautiful beach. Its a pity that it cant be clean"
Juan P,"San Fernando, Buenos aires, Argentina",Mar 2016,"the best place to surf, excellent, much better than kutta. It's a dream place. I want to come back ."
Douglas C,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2016,"That seems like a self-promoting axiom, but it is true. Canggu is where Bali gets its reputation as a surf capital in Asia. Yes, Uluwatu has much bigger swells, upwards of 25 feet, but Canggu is where the locals really know how to surf and where they spend a good deal of time.This is a great, non-crowded beach. It has about four to seven Warungs on the beachside, depending on how you are counting. It has a few big restaurants near the rocks, at the end of the road. And it's filled with everyone from locals to Europeans, to Americans to Australians. And there are even the occasional bare-breasted ladies who think it's cool to go au natural in one of the more conservative cultures in Asia. The people are friendly. For the most part the beach is clean. Yes, you see dogs around, but then if you don't see dogs, you are not on a SE Asia beach.There are also cows. Lots of cows. Even cute baby cows every rainy season who like to frolic and gambol in the sand. Respect them. They are very nice cows."
JoyHua,London,Mar 2016,If you're there for the surf and crave a long left hander than I'm sure you'll find plenty to love about Canggu beach but as a beach to relax on I'm sure that Bali can offer better. Worst of all is the shocking amount of plastic littered on the beach. During a storm I watched  a drain open up and so much rubbish rushing towards the ocean that I was compelled to pick up as much as I could and put in the trash. Not one other person joined me. A local thanked me but still the ocean is life and we should be doing more to protect it.
Kristina S,7 contributions,Jan 2016,"Canggu is such an amazing gem- bustling with cafe's, great eats and people- behind it's seemingly countryside look. You will be walking along encountering cows and local farmlife- and next minute you stumble across small cafes and restaurants and will be served the meal of your life. We extended our stay there- ditched other destinations, came back before leaving- and even contempleted extending our flight home- just because we were so smitten with Canggu"
Pinay Nomad,"New Orleans, LA",Mar 2016,"I went here 3 times for sunset. I like watching the surfers and the dogs running around like kids. It made me miss my pets so much. I recommend this place for anyone who will be visiting North Kuta, Bali. Best time to come during sunset"
SJW2,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Much quieter than other beaches in the area, authentic bars and restaurants waters pretty rough but fun sand is black we enjoyed the day there "
Matilda M,"Manly, Australia",Mar 2016,"If you can handle big surf or you just want to catch some rays on a beach chair near the ocean, Canggu beach is your spot. Grab a beach chair with umbrella for 30,000IDR/person - just be aware of the tides as they might wash you away!"
Mariahahansen,"Rohnert Park, CA",Mar 2016,Lots of walking up and down the beach with my 5 year old. Not a great swimming beach but very fun and entertaining nonetheless. Didn't like seeing all the trash but was inspired by two non-Balinese people spending their day picking up trash along the beachfront. Tons of surfers enjoying waves but also quiet places to hang and watch the ocean. Particularly beautiful at sunset. Early in the am we could see cows walking the beach from our villa. 
Mrskussy,"Agnes Water, Australia",Mar 2016,"After 10 visits to Bali was time to try a different area other than Nusa dua, Sanur, legian, Tuban or ubud.... What we loved - the village atmosphere, the lack of shopping ( a few small fine boutiques though ), the no hawkers, the quiet, the choice of accommodation, the OUTSTANDING restaurants at a reasonable price, the long beach walks, safely zipping around on a scooter, the live music, the day spa, watching the surfers. 8 days was really only just enough. What we didn't love - being only a handful of people over 30 and the odd ones out - great for the young ones in their 20/30s. Will tell my daughter about it LOL Despite this, I am sure we will be back as I liked it way more than legian and Tuban."
Jitske J,"Groningen, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"I heard the most amazing things about Canggu before I went there so I had high expectations but looking back I feel like I wasted my time going there. I spend 3 days there, 3 days too much. The beach was a big disappointment. Not a good place for sunbathing or swimming (or snorkeling). Just only for surfing. I had expected a relaxing feel to the place and nice bars and restaurants just next to the beach, like in Seminyak, but this wasn't the case. There were some facilities but a bit far from the sea and the restaurants more close to it had very uncomfortable seats and didn't feel cozy at all. I would not go here again."
Viczenden,"Victoria, Canada",Jan 2016,I came here for an afternoon to see the beach.  Glad I came!  it was quiet that day but VERY HOT!  I ate a local restaurant afterwards and then went back and watched the sunset:)
dean c,"Eaton, Australia",Mar 2016,"If ur not into Surfing I wouldn't plan a big stay up here.. the waves are good, theres plenty of nice rest around..But the beach is black, rocky and not suited for swimming..."
Suzanne C C,"Nelson Bay, Australia",Feb 2016,"I rode my scooter down to the beach, and I'm glad I did, because from the beach end of  Jl. Batu Bolong, it's easy to ride along near the beach front to Echo Beach, which is further north. When you arrive at the beach, there is a hive of activity, as there are many surf schools, and learner as well as experienced surfers. There are also many warungs, and a huge favourite 'hangout' bar/cafe named 'Old Man's', right at the end of the road on the beachfront.  It has fantastic food, starting early for breakfast, right through the evening. Old Man's also has surfboard racks, and outdoor shower, toilets and change rooms.  Very easy access and great facilities!  "
Robbert,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"good place to start surfing, less crowded than echo beach and still a good surf. rent a board and take a lesson if needed"
864greyghost22,"Boise, ID",Jan 2016,The most amazing sunset you'll ever see. Travel by scooter is best and very accessible to rent and it's cheap too.
66kombivan,"Bundoora, Australia",Jan 2016,"Rooftop breakfast overlooking the surf, grab your board, 10 minute stroll to ""Old mans'"" beach, small warung selling wax, cold drinks and board hire and a shower to wash off the salt. Sleep, eat, repeat!"
Eg007,"Bennebroek, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"The sand is black but the waves, the wadungs  and cafes are great. We were here during the rain season and loved every moment. it's a lot cleaner then Seminyak beach and the waves are better."
Dominika F,"Prague, Czech Republic",Nov 2015,"Surfing, sea, waves, what else do you need to have the perfect time? Plus, they rent surfs and sell beer everywhere :)"
Firsta,Indonesia,Jan 2016,"This beach (I think it is called Batu Bolong Beach not Canggu Beach) is a great place to hang out close to sunset time. It is also a spot for surfing. There is not much happening, just several chairs and umbrellas (plus several local ladies selling bracelets and saroongs), and people surfing, but this is probably why this beach is great to visit. You can go to Old's man if you want a more lively ambiance."
emzeperx,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jan 2016,"This section of the beach is not well maintained, litter around just like at most places. Does not offer any services, except for the surf rental."
LittleNickyA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,A great beach any time of day but particularly beautiful at sunset. Plenty of places to buy food and drinks along the beach and sit back and take in the view
David R,France,Dec 2015,Much better than the vibrant Kuta and Seminyak beaches.Batu Bolong is very attractive road and retains the spirit of Bali.
Franzi B,"Leipzig, Germany",Sep 2015,If you are on bali you need to go to canggu. It's my most favourite place ever. Beaches are awesome and good surfing vibes everywhere.
LIVETOTRAVEL8,"Burpengary, Australia",Jan 2016,beach has hawkers. vendors with drinks. waves. beds and umbrellas. for hire. a temple. a busy bar full of backpacker types. clean beach to swim in. 
David R,Sydney,Jan 2016,Great surf beach with easy access and a variety of offerings for food and drinks around.The beach vendors are super cheap and everything is relaxed. 
Ellemay 🍹🐠🐳,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"We were staying down the road at Berawa Beach & decided to drive up to Canggu to watch the surf & sunset. The surf is excellent for board riders however for swimming it was a little dangerous as the surf was pretty big. We preferred Berawa Beach for swimming. The sand is black which is hard to adjust to after our gorgeous beaches in Sydney. Canggu is much quieter than busy Seminyak or Kuta however it will probably change soon as there is a lot of development happening around the area which is a shame as the area is lovely with still some rice paddies & local village communities. Overall - Fabulous surfing beach, black sand, good cafes & restaurants , interesting shopping & overall peaceful area of Bali."
lillypilly72,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Echo beach is a great surfing beach with large waves.It has volcanic sand and just before many restaurants overlooking the beach,nice to watch the waves whilst sipping on a cocktail."
happylinch,468 contributions,Jan 2016,It isvery difficult to find this beach as many private properties had closed the access and after we find it the beach is not beautiful. It is totally not worth the ride
harwhat_79,"Isle of Wight, UK",Jan 2016,"Only for the waves, you'd go.Black hot sand, beaches littered with all types of rubbish & plastics. Bali needs to act now ! "
LinaSuraini,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,One of the beaches that are not full of tourists. Not sure if it usually is but it was empty when we came around 2pm in December. There were a couple of guys surfing though. Definitely for those who prefer to get away from the popular hot spots and have a relaxing and peaceful time here. 
mi2foodie,20 contributions,Dec 2015,"Canggu has it all: great restaurants, good beaches, and loads of activities for all to enjoy. Super chill place"
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Dec 2015,A great place to visit especially if you are into surfing. It an be a difficult break to surf but great for the experienced. Over the years it is becoming more and more popular so I would suggest costing now before it becomes like Uluwatu and Kuta. Lots of warungs and cafes around to eat and have coffe. As I said. It is getting popular so go now 
Ryan R,Barbados,Dec 2015,"If you're in the Canggu area and looking to try surfing, this is a good beach to check out. If youre more into looking at the sufer guys and gals while sipping on a coconut and catching some rays, this is also a good beach to check out."
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Completed first ever surfing lesson on this beach in Canggu. Surf instructor Desu from Desu de Bali Surf School drove to this long reef break. Plenty of boards for hire at beach, food, drinks and shower available and nice drive through rice fields of Canggu on way."
pamelandfred,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Feb 2015,"Really nice beach, relatively clean with black lava sand and big volcanic rocks.My husband surfed here and I took pics"
crazybulie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2015,Canggu Beach has become the new little Kuta with over development by westerners. The reef breaks give  nice long ride and Café Canggu always is a great place for food and a drink.For those more into night life old mans is a great place. For those seeking traditional Bali it has left Canggu.
Civetfan,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,"The first time I went to Canggu was in June 2014. It was then still relatively quiet beach (I visited Batu Bolong), especially if you compare with Kuta. I fell in love with Canggu and longed to get back. Now, being back a couple of times I start to see more clearly and I have adjusted my opinion about Canggu.Canggu is used to be covered by abundance rice fields and limitless coconut trees at her beaches, the saying goes. But now it is becoming, pitifully, more and more like her oldest sisters, Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Here and there you can see pieces of rice fields, but villa's at various styles and sizes are becoming the dominant landscape. Surfers come for all over the world to use this place as their playground. Cafe's and Bar, all made to fit the western styles, are in abundance. I do not get this. If you are on holiday in exotic country, why on earth you want to have croissant with bacon for breakfast, mozzarella salad for lunch and spare ribs for dinner? Try nasi bungkus instead at local waroeng for € 0.4 ( Rp. 5.000). Try kopi tubruk (Balinese coffee) instead of espresso. And ask for a bike for transportation, instead of a motorcycle. Perhaps by doing this there is a vain hope that the damage is a little less than worst.The mass tourism, wherein I, myself, also participate, has contributed to the loss of more and more rice fields or to put it more critically, the loss of Balinese' authenticity and its nature.  How ironic the fate of Balinese. Thousand of years ago they run away from the influence of Islam by sailing from Java to be able to preserve its culture, only to be now slowly destroyed by mass tourism. This time, sadly, there is no escape for Balinese."
topdogpete,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2015,"Uncrowded beach with food, drinks and restaurants. Coolest surf beach. Reasonably safe for swimming."
heidiwho,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2015,Spent a few mornings here having a surf followed by a coconut water in a local warung. Loved seeing the locals going about daily life.
keehk,"Düsseldorf, Germany",Nov 2015,"This Beach is only good for Surfers. Its mostly crowded but have good waves. And chill an the ""Old Man's"" Bar."
Sarah n Pete R,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"We took an afternoon to visit this beach and watch the sunset, it is a very simple beach with a few stalls  to buy take away food or some very basic places to buy a beer, sunset was great to watch from this spot."
Sapper786,"Kambalda, Australia",Oct 2015,"Beautiful sunsets , great bars and warungs.Quiet and relaxing .Great surf .The local traders are fantastics and friendly."
Zac,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,Beautiful beach for the family to visit. Definitely a must-do if you are near the area. Great place for drinks.
LefrogPerth,Perth,Oct 2015,"Canggu beach is for surfers, black volcanic beach, close to Echo Beach, not much shade except for the hire beach umbrellas available"
Skydiver222,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Canggu beach is a nice laid back beach to visit. If you are looking to try out surfing, here you find it at affordable price. Can rent a board for as cheap as USD3.00. Lessons vary per price but can negotiate for about 20-30usd. The waves are low enough.  A great don't you catch the beautiful Balinese sunset and enjoy a refreshing drink.  "
geelongexpat,"Chatan-cho, Japan",Oct 2015,"I spent this afternoon at Canggu Beach. It is a fabulous little beach where for 30000 IDR you can chill under a beach umbrella. Hardly any touts sell in this area either. There are several surf schools as well so you can watch everyone try to surf too. The current is very strong for swimmers so be prepared to fall over a few times wading out into the ocean. If you head south towards Seminyak, you will also find some nice areas of the beach that don't have any tourists on them."
JosephineSalvador,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Aug 2015,Canggu beach is quieter than other  beaches which is lovely. It has a large stretch of darker sand and has plenty of beachside cafes and restaurants. The waves are too high for a beginner but good for intermediate surfers.
Chris,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2015,"Lovely little place to watch surfers in the water, waiting for the waves. In the shadows of a parasol at a vendor stand, hold on to your cold bintang and watch the waves break on the big rock. Relaxed surfers vibe."
trecev,"Manila, Philippines",Sep 2015,"Nice, chill place. Lot's of options to eat and drink. Food stalls for grilled corn and fresh coconut. For drinks and cool music, there's Old Man's"
Carmen J,"Hillegom, The Netherlands",Sep 2015,"Nice beach, like Canggu, its a surfers village and has a relaxed vibe. Its beaches are not the most beautiful of the world, but has some great waves!"
Sean E,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Canggu Beach is an awesome beach with a massive surf.Be careful if you have kids as it's pretty huge!The beach sand is dark due to the volcanic area.
ecutting2,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2015,This beach has great surf . Much quieter beach than Kuta and not hassled to buy from the locals. Right next door to echo beach with beachside eateries. Fantastic sunsets. Great place to get away from the hussle and bustle.
petter111,"Berlin, Germany",Sep 2015,Nice place to learn how to surf. Decent rates on surfboard rental and lessons. Nice bar/restaurants close to the beach.
Peter H,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"amazing spot especially for sureferts , great food and service - a must see spot that is still nice and quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of kuta or seminyak"
Nansv,"Antwerp, Belgium",Sep 2015,"Top location if you want to visit a more quite beach during the day. Evenings are super in the bars, nice atmospere."
heamon01,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Easy access, umbrellas and lounges or beanbags to hire..great beach for surfing, surf lessons available, food carts and a bar.."
cicc0,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Sand is course and very dirty.Poorly maintained Shore.Restuarants and small retail shops remind me of Anglesea,Torquay & Ocean Grove etc over 30 years ago.Tourists incur Charges for Car Parking."
Melanie B,17 contributions,Aug 2015,"Canggu is great for surfing and its absolutely the hipster part from bali. More chillout and the evenings are quite, not many parties over there. A good break after the busy and super touristic kuta."
Jenny D,"Mona Vale, Australia",Aug 2015,"As my other half was unable to surf this year (injuries) and we had already booked, I was dubious about Canggu this time. We swam each morning early - the beach is black sand and typical of Bali. However it was refreshing and challenging at times with the shore break - but doable. We were the only swimmers amongst the surfers!"
Ubud Village To... K,70 contributions,Aug 2015,If you like surfing in Bali you can tray coming to Canggu beach.that is one of beach in Bali very good for surfing because the wake for good end hige.besiade of that the area more kwayet then other beach.very nice
DrVLee,"Philadelphia, PA",Aug 2015,Very scenic with great surfing! Lot's of young people as well as families on the beach. Easy to get to with great food options in the nearby neighborhood to reload.
Federico O,"Ponte San Nicolo, Italy",Jun 2015,"It's been a wonderful vacation in a surfhouse close to the beach, that is perfect for surfing and for a family with lillte children who wants to enjoy the beach life (playing with sand and so on). Unfortunately one of the last day someone stole our camera right in the middle of the beach when we were playing in the water... So keep your eyes open!!"
sat_owl,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"Excellent place to surf, but not for swimming. Large abandoned hotel near the beach makes the place great for hangout and scenic photography."
YK Ng,"Munich, Germany",Jun 2015,"Stopped by at this beach during noon time on a working day. it was quiet place except the sound of big sea wave washing the beach. There were about 2 dozen of people enjoying their surfing, and a couple riding horse and their camera man taking wedding photos. The beach is pretty nice. Wave is strong so may not be suitable for swimming, except those going for surfing."
Rebecca M,"Banbury, UK",Sep 2014,"This is the first village we stayed in  when we very first came to Bali in1996. Since that time we have visited eleven times more. We have God children there and consider the island and the folk wr have come to know and trust there our second home.Canggu beach was a favourite spot of mine and grew on mevthe more I saw if it with every subsequent visit. There was a time when we didn't visit Bali as we do have other places to see in the world and after another 43 countries we returned. Canggu was no longer the lovely place we remember. It has changed for the worst to becoming a silly surfer's hangout, there us a place there now that has been named Echo beach....what???? Dear me where do these airheads come from?? The beach still holds its charm in some places but had become some sort of pretentious bimbo retreat with really silly youngsters trying to outdo one another on the surf stakes. Unfortunately for Canggu this has spoilt its natural appeal. It's still a remarkable beach along some parts but is declining into a total tourist trap with all the usual restaurants ,coffee places and  bars, God help us it looks as if its on its way to becoming Kuta..Still has beautiful black sand and fantastic surf....lets hope it doesn't get any worse..."
Nadan06,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Canggu beach is great to hang at echo beach cafes, then hit the surf or lay on the beach, renting a sun lounge and drinking juices etc"
JuanLonelyTraveller,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2015,"A bit overrated, the surf was nice and the place was popular with europeans. A lot of beach sellers selling bracelets and offering massages which can be a bit annoying. It smelt funny so we only stayed for a swim."
Wisnu Utomo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"The beach is actually not too special, but if you are looking for a different atmosphere, and already bored with the beaches of Seminyak, Kuta what else .... So the beach is very suitable to be a distraction :)One with a swampy coastline and echo beach."
Robert E,"Lviv, Ukraine",Jul 2015,"We hired scooters and took the drive up the coast to enjoy some beach that was far less crowded and we enjoyed a good surf and relax on the beach, would really recommend this for travellers"
MargaretTMS,"Glasgow, UK",Jun 2015,Great surfing beachLocal folk have stalls along side selling food and wares.Very busy both with tourists and localsLots of debris and litter tho 
Jeremy F,"Constantia, South Africa",Jul 2015,"The beach has three or four great surf spots and also has some nice bars to hang out at. The problem is the beach has dirty black sand and there are strong currents that are not great for swimming in. Water quality has been questionable in some reports to, people getting sick from it. "
Avi G,"Carlsbad, California, United States",Jul 2015,A wide selection of reefs and breaks that allow you to get the most out of your trip away from Kuta.  A good community of restaurants and proximity to Seminyak for a little city life make Canggu a great region to explore.
amraldo,"Canberra, Australia",Jul 2015,Fun beach and surf vibe with lots of great healthy cafes for post surf snacks. Old man's is good for happy hour also and has a nice market once a fortnight/month (not sure exactly how frequent :-)
Ashan1991,"Byron Bay, Australia",Mar 2015,I liked easy take off fun wall .too many people in the water disliked the dogs every where but that's life
Sherry G,17 contributions,Jun 2015,"Great hip beach. Excellent eats, nice sandy beaches with opportunity to rent surf boards. Try the young cocnuts; refreshing and cheap."
chris cat,"Palm Beach, FL",Aug 2014,"Very beautiful, very clean. Mostly a locals spot which is what i loved about it. Cheap rentals if you don't need the nightlife and bars and such. About a 20 minute scooter ride from Kuta. Great surfing but there can be a mean undertow so be careful. Take a local guide - they are cheap and very knowledgeable."
Mici0303,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Apr 2015,"This beach is settled only 30 minutes drive from crowded Kuta and is a good place for relaxed days at the beach or even for catching some good waves. There are enough spots where you can rent a surf or hire a ""surf instructor"", there are some bars and places where you can get a snack.  Along the Canggu beach you can find several good places to stay, villas and other accomodation fascilities with swimming pools, even walking distance from the ocean. "
Max274967,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"It's nice to go a bit further north to Canggu for some hassle free waves and a much nicer environment than the beaches further south. There is also a great market set up on a Sunday where there is a bar and a restaurant, all in all it is a lovely chill out place!"
10connie1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"The boys enjoyed surfing. There are quite a few options of restaurants, to beach side BBQ restaurants to cafesSpa treatments & surf shops"
Christopher555,"Toronto, Canada",Jul 2015,We happened to be staying in Canggu because of a yoga training so we had to see Canggu beach. It is quite dirty and has large waves. Nothing spectacular. I wouldn't recommend driving a far distance to see this beach. At best it is an average beach
bondibubble,Sydney,Dec 2014,I'd sadly stay away from the beach. It's polluted and the surf is not good. It's much better to stay at your villa and enjoy the pool.
Brian K,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,"Canggu's a great place to come for surfing and hanging out, especially at Old Mans bar which has a great vibe and has happy hour from 5-6 everyday. The beach itself is pretty dirty, there's lots of rubbish and dogs everywhere who all use the beach as their toilet so sunbath here at your own risk! There are also lots of good places to eat in the area, especially Betelnut Cafe. Definitely worth a visit for a few days."
Rai Hanah M,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,If you are looking to enjoy a quiet time by the beach and hates going to Kuta ... this is it.  Lots of small cafes that serves good food and the beach is not crowded.
Natees,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2014,"Great surf beach,friendly locals and not too far out from the hustle and bustle in Kuta, well worth the drive/scooter out  to here, would even consider staying here next time in Bali and visiting other places from here."
John M,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015, long open beach good for walks and a couple of beach breaks for surfing. Not for inexperienced swimmers - they are best with a cool drink watching the sunset
cherylmL457TW,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2015,surf beach was great very friendly locals with food on the beach You can enjoy a Bintang on the beach at sunset with all the locals
LinksProperty,Torquay,Jun 2015,"Amazing new water park. Clean and not busy, rides to ourselves. Access to the Club and all the facilities gym. Great day out"
Papillonul,"Timisoara, Romania",Jun 2015,"First contact with a beach in Bali and it was a surfer's beach. Just my luck. So you can go at Batu Bolong Beach for a walk, tan, surf, chillax, but not for a swim that's for sure. I tried 2 times and got hit to the sand by the waves. It's also a bit dirty and not very crowded (in May that is)"
Hungry-mum,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2015,"This is a surfer paradise.I went in for a dip and got hacked about by massive waves, still finding sand in my ears and bikini days later!"
Raymondale,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2014,"Waves are big,not for swimming,but quiet beach,can sit there and stare the sea!also you can go to oter beach from here,like echo beach,nelayan beach etc."
Darwinfoodie2014,"Darwin, Australia",May 2015,Canggu is a haven for Surfing.  Lots of young people hanging out and riding waves.  Families playing on the beach and beautiful sunset.  Lots of local street food vendors and cold beers at Old Mans
Lun2Travel,Canberra,May 2015,"We have been in past years but I think this will be our last trip to this place.  It's now very, very crowded, very dirty and the traffic makes it a nightmare.  We stayed less than a 100 metres from the beach in a lovely villa but we enjoyed our country stays a lot more.  Many sites say Canggu is well placed for shopping in Semiyak or Kuta but it's not - the road system is too crowded to get anywhere quickly or comfortably.  I'd suggest the country - Amed, Candi Desa, Lovina offer much better experiences than Canggu."
Xavier G,"Lindau, Germany",May 2015,"The sand is dark and the beach quite dirty. But perfect for beginner surfers. No long chairs going with bars, you must pay 60 000 rupies for 2h."
Firdaus Alip,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Amazing beach, amazing waves, amazing atmosphere (Old Man's). If you're walking on the rock pools, be sure to put on some form of footwear. I saw a small flower urchin (red and white bristles) while walking. O.o"
TheBrownsAdelaide,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2015,"Good surf beach, good vibe at sunset, you can sit and watch the sun go down with a Bintang and a corn on the cob cooked on an open coal grill. "
riaakbar2014,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Good wave, restaurants, sunset, blue ocean, surfer, relaxing, dining, its a perfect place to spend your day. Do not miss to visit this place if you are in Canggu area. You will love this place !!!"
Rosalyne L,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"This beach is not suitable for swimming, lots of rubbish and only for surfers. Avoid this area is your are looking for a nice beach to relax and swim"
Eefje B,5 contributions,Apr 2015,"This is heaven for surfers. And for the ones who don't surf, hire a bed on the beach and watch everything that happens in the water."
Erwin K,"Bandung,Indonesia",Feb 2015,"Visited the Canggu beach near Pura Petitinget on February 2015 , it was a very hot morning.Unlike other reviews here , we found that the Canggu beach was in a nice condition and relatively clean, so we went for a swim, well , maybe the filthy beach was in the different part of Canggu.Great beach for a swim with moderate waves, black sands.Would be great to watch the sunset from here."
Jaya Wisesa,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"First time come to Canggu beach, when i am escort my Japanese friends for surfing. He love it very much, and always come to Bali every years. Especialy to Canggu beach"
SingaporeExpaddy,dublin,Feb 2015,This is a great beach and a good spot to join the locals in the evening for sunset when food stalls pop up.
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"This beach at JL. Batubolong is a great surfing beach but not a safe beach for kids and swimming,  very strong rips and try to avoid in wet season when debri is washed up onto the beach. Can get some amazing sunsets and eateries there!"
Frankyschuman,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,Good for surfing though very run down area with no care for area Lots of rubbish in the waterLots of stray dogs and 3rd world surroundings 
Timothy R O,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2015,"If you're the surfing kind, you'll love some of the breaks, the warmer water and easy access to the beach, but from a swimmers point of view, the beaches on this side of the island are pretty gross to look at, dirty coloured sand doesn't look great.."
Mel P,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,I didn't feel the need to leave the Sanctuary but even when I did venture out it was close to everything.
Thommay,"Munich, Germany",Dec 2014,"long beach walks and jogging in the morning are great, sunsets in the evening stunning.ride a pushbike on the sand - or push it when it's to hard.warungs will provide food and drinks."
bhavanity,62 contributions,Sep 2014,"Love this place. Definitely a place for the surf boarders. A place where you can relax and chill. there is a toilet for shower but a simple 1. No hot water. If  you have never surfed before, Please get an expert to guide you as the currents are very strong and it can pull you further out to the sea. The seabed is not leveled, so the 3rd step, you could drop further deeper. All in all, I did enjoy the place and the view."
Piscator_78,"Cologne, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",Dec 2014,"Beach, Surf and Laid back atmosphere. Great food, nice people and a fantastic value. Nice waves and a good place to get back on the board- but definitely no beginners place, as there is a beachbreak and  rarely whitewater."
Alex M,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,Had a surf at Canggu beach today fun little waves. Convenient parking and a brilliant snow cone truck for when you are done. Not sure if it is always as dirty as it currently is though as it is wet season but alot of trash on beach and in water. Fun spot for a beginner wave but not somewhere my partner wanted to lay and tan due to the state of the beach.
khalid48,K Lumpur,Dec 2014,"It is peacefull, not too many people. Though people should be more carefull about where they throw their rubbish."
HellyandOli,6 contributions,Dec 2014,The rain and the wet season made the west coast very polluted. We had to travel to the east coast to surf / swim.
JunkHouse,Asia,Nov 2014,Crowded beach but worth to be out there to catch the waves. Best time I had was during sunset.. totally blown away by the beauty. 3 minutes walk to a bar and other restaurants. 
katka365,"Pilsen, Czech Republic",Nov 2014,"This beach is great for starting to learn surfing on a sandy surface with shallow water, trainers and surf rental available at the beach. "
SurfBee09,"East Lansing, MI",Oct 2014,"Perfect waves, surf board rentals and lessons, photographers to capture your surfing experiences, amazing restaurants and cafes, great beach atmosphere.  "
Clarissa C,"Glasgow, UK",Nov 2014,"Not your typical tropical beach that looks like paradise, but there aren´t crowds, and it is pretty quiet. Good for beginner surfers as there are many breaks around, even though the crowds can be huge ate sunset, which is also worth watching."
melissa m,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,Everyone always talks about the sunset in Seminyak but it is the same here in Canggu. Even better as less crowded. Love the beach and the waves here. Very relaxing!
Veronica S,"Melton, Australia",Aug 2014,"The surf is good here. The sand is black  because of Bali's now extinct (I hope) volcanoes. Comes as a shock if your not used to black sand but hey, some people have beaches that are all pebbles! Sit and watch the sunset and sip a beer. Very soothing."
CaliGia,"San Diego, CA",Sep 2014,"We stayed at the Tugu Hotel because my boyfriend loves surfing... It's a pretty sunset, but not worth more than a day trip. There was so much trash on the beach, stray animals and sewage running into the water where the surfers surf. I would recommend visiting Seminyak for surfing instead."
Mayu106,"Tokyo, Japan",Sep 2014,Big waves and currents but nice to stroll and sit at some of the beach cafes to watch the skillful surfers. Looks like one an expat community favourite locations. Upcoming area 
whereintheworldisgpc,"Zurich, Switzerland",Sep 2014,Canggu Beach is not made for bathing but its great for surfing. The reef brake brings out great waves and offers good conditions for intermediate to advanced surfers. Few board rentals and surf teachers are available on the beach as well as some restaurants and canggus institution old man's bar.
MurrumbaJo,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2014,"If you do not mind black sand this is a nice beach.  Lots of learner and better surfers towards Old Man's Beach.  Nothing to eat or drink here. Fishing boats, old boat shacks, photographers, walkers and a great sunset."
Ankitpri,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,"quite towards the rights stretch of the beach, can lye down and enjoy shades and drinks provided by locals"
Diana M,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Sep 2014,It's very nice but it isn't the kind of the beach to swimming and relax cos there are a lot of waves most of the time
chris0084,117 contributions,Aug 2014,"We stood in Canggu village in a nice villa and went to Canggu Beach. We were very disappointed and we didn't expect a perfect beach. We were looking for a relaxed beach with a few people. The beach was very dirty, with rubbish from local people but also from tourists. The surfers like the good waves, but for the rest there is nothing. We would not recommand it at all. On the way to the beach are some very nice restaurants and bars. Stopp there for lunch or dinner and go to Echo Beach, it's a little bit better."
Jason D,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,nice beach for sunset. lots of rubbish and generally dirty which is a pity as it's a wonderful spot. Surfing is excellent.
Schungo,"Furstenfeldbruck, Germany",Aug 2014,"Beach for surfers. Beginners can easily find surf instructers or play in the whitewater. All others find consistent swell. Lots of Boardsds to hire (Short, Long, Beginners). Small Bites, cafes and Restaurants avaiable.Not good for swimmers, nice to watch the sunset"
IckenhamChris,"Ruislip, UK",Aug 2014,"Good sandy beach, a few  sun loungers on beach or on grassed area just above the beach. Great for Surfing, swimming best when it is low tide. Couple of beach bars with food nearby"
AnthonyV2222,"Port Douglas, Australia",Jun 2014,"Great place to get some satay, grab a drink and watch the sun go down with some background music. Small markets. Thoroughly enjoyable."
255100Sunlover,"Mt Eliza, Australia",Aug 2014,"Had a morning coffee at Ol Man's cafe here. It's always nice to chill and watch the surf.  This is a great surf beach, plenty of boards etc available for hire, but not one that I would visit to swim to lie on the beach. Also thought the area was a bit trashy - more effort needed to clean it up."
WouterBaliIndonesia,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun 2014,Nice to take a walk when it's not to hot. Canggu beach is mainly a surf beach without much (sun-)bathing accomodation. There is often a lot of thrash on the beach left there by the tides and feeded by the rivers of Bali and Java. Despite the overpopulation and 9 million visitors a year there is no proper thrash collection on Bali. The Balinese even avoid often the paid service there is and throw their thrash in the rivers. It ends up in the sea and the tide brings it to the beach including used pampers and worse. Just dumping in the sea also goes for the sewage. The whole island with millions of people doing there thing right into the sea. The consequences are that survers are confronted with ear infections and worse. The surfers are by the way the only people who can go safely into the sea. Bathing is risky because of the treacherous currents which take every year several people who drown. But it's a nice beach to walk.
Dave9G,"Ghent, Belgium",Jul 2014,"Volcanic sand beach which had quite some litter laying around. We found the other beaches we went to on our holiday much nicer than this one, although it does offer good conditions for sufers."
new2travelling,Warkworth,Jul 2014,"Lots of surfers and a few cafes (we tried a large fancy Grocer and Grind one which was nice but not cheap), black sand, more rustic beach for surfing and exploring rather than relaxing."
sbgholse,"Nagpur, India",Jun 2014,I went here in the evening.It has black sand unlike kuta and senymak beaches in bali.it iss not so attractive and pleasant
BelMac,"Mount Macedon, Australia",Jun 2014,"There are many surfing beaches in Canggu - Pererenan, Echo, Batu Bolong, Berawa... They are all black sand, not so developed as other beaches in Bali and have great surf. Not so good for swimming unless you are experienced."
vee_vita,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"Surfer are welcome here! There are so many surf board rentals and there cafe too. This beach is good for surfing, but not for beginner I think. There are some solid rocks make surfing a bit dangerous if you're a beginner. Locals are everywhere too but not as crowded as Kuta and Seminyak beach."
Irfantaufikr,"Bandung, Indonesia",Nov 2013,"I went to canggu bad session. So, i can't see the best wave in here. But my friend told to me, if I go when best session, i can see the best wave here. Sometimes, I will back there and try to surfing there. One more, Sand of canggu beach is black"
dancingdooth,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2014,"Went for a walk along the beaches of Canggu... dark brown sand..I think we are spoilt with the beaches in Australia, as a comparison.. saw horseriders & lots of surfers, with good waves..so this is the main attraction... parts of beach very littered, and a few bali dogs to beware of... not one of my most favourite places"
J-Lou_travels,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Black sanded beach not very good for swimming, but an awesome place to surf regardless of ability. Good channel to swim out plus the peak give you long rides. Local guides and boards are available from the car parks and there is always a coconut waiting for you after your time in the water. "
waleos,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,"I dont know what its really called, batu bolong beach, or canggu beach, but the place marker at this site' review is wrong, as its nowhere near the beach. There's other reviews also about this beach. Anyhow, talking about the beach, its big waves and surfers paradise. There's plenty of surf boards for rent at the beach, few eating places, beach style, nothing fancy and the waves are just strong. Think twice before swimming there. Very quiet, not that many people and kind of peacefull for a relaxing holiday."
Mark F,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2014,"It looked better than Kuta Beach, calm and far away from noisy thing around there.Local people so nice and help to get direction to find the beach. Worth it."
bazzawa,"Marmion, Australia",Apr 2014,We were there at low tide and found it an unattractive beach. It is interesting to watch the surfers if the surf is up.
kelly b,"Brasilia, DF",Mar 2014,"i have visited canggu beach very nice please but right now canggu beach is not good because very dirty with rubish if the beach clean very good, over all i suggest the surrounding community to keep clean on the beach"
DragonTracks,"Tokyo, Japan",Mar 2014,What a dirty smelly place. Lots of rubbish and dog poo everywhere.  Sat on the steps by the beach but the smell from possibly a sewage pipe quickly made me move! Lots of surfers to watch which was the only fun aspect of the beach. There were a lot of dogs on the beach....some with owners but many without. I hope the expensive hotels just up the road from the beach invest some money into clearing it up. It has potential.
Lb4way,"Moscow, Russia",Mar 2014,"Мы с мужем жили в пяти минутах от этого пляжа. Его еще называют Echo Beach. Океан тут скорее не для купания, волнение, по моим меркам, довольно приличное, зато радость серферам! Впрочем, и мы с удовольствием попрыгали у берега на волнах. Насколько мне известно, это место хорошо подходит для серферов начального и среднего уровня. Народу не много, тихо, спокойно. Песок черный вулканический и очень мелкий. Забивается просто-таки везде!На пляже отличный Sand Bar с очень приветливыми и отзывчивыми работниками. Есть лежаки, зонтики и кресла-подушки за 50.000IDR. Можно взять доску или буги-борд напрокат.  Неплохой лист коктейлей и всякой закуски. Каждую неделю тут проходят open air вечеринки. А чуть в сторону несколько ресторанчиков, в которых готовят в том числе морепродукты на гриле. Ну оооочень вкусно!Это место, куда я надеюсь вернуться еще раз!My husband and I lived just five minutes from the beach. It is also called Echo Beach. The ocean here is probably not for swimming. To me it is pretty decent, but the joy for surfers! However, we jumped on the waves near the shore.As far as I understood, this place is well suited for surfers primary and secondary levels. Not many people, quietly, calmly. The sand is volcanic black and very small partickles. Finally it was just about everywhere in or clothes and bags!On the beach there is an excellent Sand Bar with very friendly and helpful staff. It is possible to rent beach beds, umbrellas and ""soft chairs"" for 50.000IDR. You can also rent a surf board or boogie board. There is quite good list of cocktails and all kind of snacks.Every week they make open air parties.Slightly aside several restaurantsare situated, serving grilled seafood. Sooooo tasty!This is the place where I hope to come back again!"
RJ R,"West Palm Beach, FL",Mar 2014,This area has great waves and breaks if you enjoy surfing. It is not a swimming beach. The unfortunate problem all waters around Bali have is the surmounting issue of trash. And it is too bad. Hopefully Bali and the surrounding islands will get his under control before more damage is done.
Airmanis,"Western Australia, Australia",Feb 2014,"Canggu beach was once a beautiful piece of coast but it is now a collection of half demolished sea walls, ghost hotel developments and concrete. Talk about paradise lost! Go south to Batu Bolong for a nice beach /surf experience."
luvlight,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,this is a lovely part of bali with lots of villas in rice fields and some good restaurants and shops increasingly built up with more choices for eating every time we comethe area is relatively quiet but has lots of things to do shop eat surf yoga shop around as prices and value vary a great deal
Frederic D,"Le Havre, France",Aug 2013,"Dislike: Black sand, Garbage, Dogs, Dog's poop, Like: Sorry tell you the truth, nothing I like from this beach"
Audrey T,19 contributions,Jan 2014,"Due to the high human traffic & lack of cleaning services, the beaches are generally filthy but for advanced level waves and a cheaper alternative to Seminyak, come here for sunset and dinner."
patrick l,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2013,Canggu is a great place to learn how to surf and progress. Start at Old Man's for the nice slow waves and move to Echo for the fast steeper waves. The warungs on the beach have good food at good prices. Black sand and at low tide good for swimming. Be aware of waste in the water. Just like the rest of Bali is Canggu unfortunately really dirty!
FiDeVi,Darwin,Nov 2013,"I love this beach, rugged with a beautiful black/golden sandQuiet with a good friendly local vibe!Enjoyed a dip in the ocean too.If your not a strong swimmer or surfer beware of rips(note: it's not in a popular tourist area so there can be some rubbish on the beach)"
Linda K,"London, UK",Oct 2013,liked that it was not a busy commercialised beach - it felt very real and local.  Disliked that it was in need of a bit of a clean up in terms of debris
Kimberley F,Hong Kong,Oct 2013,"Best beginner / intermediate surf spot. Go to Canggu Cafe after your morning session to grab a good, strong Bali coffee and some breakfast! Crowded during the weekdays from around 8am when the surf schools come in so try and get out there a little earlier! Ketut, a photographer, usually hangs out by the temple. Go talk to him before you head out on the waves if you want your moment to be captured on film! They'll either charge you for a single photograph or everything they get of you for the day. "
Alex P,"Exeter, UK",Oct 2013,"Canggu is a great beach, really good facilities and cafes, surf hire for just about every type of board (though some are a bit banged up) and instructors who are really pleasant and treat everyone really nicely. The waves shift about throughout the day but there is something for everyone from the learners close in to the really serious folk out back, the paddle out there is an epic though! There is a really strong rip between Canggu and Echo which is between the the little reefs at the north end of Canggu and when the tide is in the beaches are cut off from each other. On the whole this is my favourite beach in the world, the water is warm, the people are really friendly and you don't need to drag your best board with you as there are loads to choose from at the surf shacks. The beach is a bit grubby, but no more than Portuguese beaches and you hardly notice. Should definitely be on everyone's list of places to surf."
hollie n,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2013,"Perfect surf, easy access, beautiful volcanic sand that sparkles. Path being built across top of beach for access to Echo Beach cafes."
Torerow,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2013,"Nice wild natural beach with high waves. Perfectly for chilling and sunsets, but be careful with swimming!"
oceanienne,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Oct 2013,"for persons who want to pass all sunday there, it's interesting and quiet place.The road to go there it's really nice in the middle of the rice field, not so far for the Tanah lot temple and the Nirwana golf."
Muselulu,"Portland, OR",Sep 2013,"My friend took her first surfer lesson here at Canggu Beach, and she said it was amazing. I enjoyed the view and there's a small temple there as well. Further down Batu Bolong, there are spas and a number of restaurants. A number of the restaurants seem to be non-Indo cuisine though. "
NadZ,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2013,"Beaches in Canggu area ideally good for surfing, sunset and cocktail. Such a nice time to spend my time here to explore beaches for surfing and meeting new people.I feel so delighted to choose Casa Kamboja as my homestay. They only have 4 bedrooms, but there's always surfers, really easy to find friends for surfing or hangout together.."
Jordy A,"New York City, NY",Sep 2013,Went for a paddle here but its super crowded any russiansRussians surfing - Go figure Its a great place to visit very traditional balinese people
Chase J,"Washington DC, DC",Aug 2013,"This beach has about one year left before the mega hotels (already under construction) take it over and it becomes Semenyak Part II (seriously, there's a second Potato Head being built). In the meantime come here for good waves and an excellently mellow bar and restaurant scene along the water. "
June S,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2013,Frequented by top surfers. Black sand and beach not particularly clean as no beach cleaning system in place.
Phoebe1960,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Jun 2013,"Nice long stretch of beach in both directions, you can see Kuta on one end and Tanah lot and Echo Beach at the other. Looked very safe for swimming and a lot of surfers frequent this beach."
AvidTraveler12,"Winchester, UK",May 2013,"Bali is not blessed with glorious white talcum powder beaches, the sand is not even yellow, most beaches  are muddy brown in colour and some are black sand, this is due to the volcanic nature of the island. Canguu beach is no different, there are many different colours of sand, why I like it so much is because it stetches for miles and miles, in fact Kuta beach, Legian beach, Seminyak beach, Echo beach etc, are in fact all one continious beach that overlaps the various areas on the South Western tip of Bali. I have walked from Echo Beach to Kuta Beach which will take about two hours. I stopped because I was tired and a rainstorm was setting in, I could have walked for longer as I had not run out of beach!Many hotels, beach bars and restaurants to help break up the walking or if you feel hungry."
FeildingTracey,Feilding,May 2013,"Nice quiet beach, great watching the fishing boats come in each day. Lots of surfers and nice little cafes overlooking the beach"
Elledunlop,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2013,"best place to hang out in bali, my favourite sunset spot, and best calamari at mandira cafe. They also do a great seafood bbq at a couple of the resturaunts that line the beach, excellent view, food and good prices. "
Nicole B,"Derby, Australia",Apr 2013,"We walked along the beach, found it hard to enjoy as there was a lot of rubbish floating around.There is a nice café near the surfing area however which was packed.Did a good breakfast."
Bogyglfr,"Round Rock, TX",Apr 2012,"I just stopped by here on my way to Tanah Lot and found it to be a decent beach. It was a little dirty, but that was due to the storm that came through the night before. Other than that, i found some nice shells there. i did have to avoid a couple folks trying to sell me things, but other than that it was ok. Next time I would like to spend a little more time there and check out the area."
Sergey,"Canggu, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Like all beaches in Canggu this one is very popular among surfers, and is always crowded for sunset, especially on weekends. But the beach most of the time is not very suitable for swimming for big waves. Neither I would suggest sunbathing as it's quite  dirty, especially after rains, and has no sunbeds available as there are no warungs there right on waterfront. You can hardly use it for running as the beach is interupted here and there by number of rivers, some of them very small coming and going depending on rainfall, still you will be able to cross bigger ones only if bearfooted. Still it can be a nice walk before sunset, and of course this is the place if you came to Bali either to surf, or take surfing lessons"
Frans S,13 contributions,Feb 2013,"The reef break is pretty consistent, not to big (until 6 ft) and not dangerous (flat rock). On the parking lot there is plenty of boardhire shops and surf lessons. At the end of the day the parking lot fills up with surfers and local people walking their dogs, a nice sun downer with a bintang!"
VinaTraveler,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2013,"Canggu is beach for surfers...But. if you want to do photography , you can have the best sunset here. A black beach area, very hot and also a lot of dogs. Better to go around 6pm, as if you come earlier on that time...it is Extremely Hot as no umbrellas or shades you can get it unless you will go to the resraurant, ordered and stayed there for a while."
Waiting617,"Taoyuan District, Taoyuan",Jul 2012,"the beach is clear and not so crowded, and also some people tide the horses there, but the sellers always bother you."
susi08,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2013,It was a very hot day when we went to Canggu beach and the sands were extremely hot. The lounge seats and beach umbrellas were very limited. A couple of locals were fishing on the beach. Some dogs were running around unleashed. A couple of women were topless. One hour on that beach was more than enough.
Kira,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2012,"White cafes, white umbrellas, white paints on walls against the dark brown (almost black-ish sand). Picturesque. Chilled out good vibe. Good spot for beginner-intermediate surfers. Affordable food n Bintangs served at the cafes."
InekeParis,"Paris, France",Jan 2013,"Good for surfers, but the beach is not very nice. When we were there, the beach was polluted with trash (slippers, plastic, packaging). Besides, the canggu beach does not have the best eating options. The nearby Echo beach has more options. "
LizK3,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2012,I am sure the beach would be gorgeous if a massive clean up of plastic bags and other rubbish happened!
Broscuta P,"Vienna, Austria",Jan 2012,"is nicer than in Kuta, because there are not so many turists. It is a surfer sport and there are two ore three restaurants with very good food and cheap. Internet  wi fi is also available."
Janeo56,Port Noarlunga  Australia,Nov 2012,"Lots of ceremonies with a major Temple right on the beach. Sunday my favourite with many Balinese families coming to swim, eat, pray and generally hang out"
davepoop,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2012,"The sands might be dark, but the beach and the waves, the galleries (Surfer Girl, Hurley, Yokii, and Havaianas), the restaurants and all the stuff they have as a  ""bedside"" shall be unforgettable. Don't forget the sunset :P"
Jeremy L,5 contributions,Aug 2012,"This is a great beach if you are an mid level surfer, can handle some crowds and want to have fun. Go in the dry season! Stay at the Chillhouse for the best possible experience!"
Deniz E,"Istanbul, Turkey",Oct 2012,"Good beach for surfing but it gets a bit crowded, just go early... Sunsets are beautiful. The beach is also safe for just swimming but there are nicer beaches just for a swim in bali:)"
JayKayAndDana,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2012,"Quiet, older, surfing crowd.  The palce to go away from the parties and noise...just to enjoy the beach and waves and vibe."
Trey M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2012,"We spent a day at Echo Beach, a short drive from Canggu, and an hour and a half from Ubud, where we were staying. The beach is not Bali's prettiest, nor its cleanest, but it does have decent surf for beginner to intermediate surfers, and is laid back enough to be enjoyable for a day trip. We had our 3 children, ages 7, 7, and 10, with us. They took a 2-hour lesson with the Canggu Surf School, which was well worth the money ($60 p.p. for 2 hours). The beach has a single alley with a few shops, and a handful of restaurants, so don't visit expecting the full-on, Bali tourist experience. In my opinion, this is a GOOD thing! The people who come here seem to be more relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak, and the lack of in-your-face commercialism is refreshing. I suspect the area was nicer a few years ago, before rampant development got underway. Right now, there's an enormous hotel going up, as well as a large number of apartments, and it detracts from the overall ""undiscovered"" vibe of the place. Probably has another year or so before it succumbs to the unzoned, unplanned development chaos that has subsumed a lot of Bali. Two unexpected high points: (1) The Echo Beach cafe, nearest to the temple, has a sensational BBQ every night. Worth staying past dark for! (2) If you like motorcycle/surf culture, the Deus Ex Machina Temple of Enthusiasm is just down the road."
Ozzy O,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2012,"There ARE places to get a drink - be that soft drinks, beer, milkshakes and fruit juices, great food too. Service is friendly and great.You can go right from a great surf, to relax and eat and drink, then get back out for another surf.Beginner-Intermediate through to advance waves."
moanaw42,4 contributions,Sep 2012,"the waves were good in the mornings and evenings, im from Hawaii and had a blast surfing the right down on the north end. "
T_Killeen,T_diddy,Sep 2012,Quiet area with some nice restaurants. Black/grey sand. Lots of stray dogs (that are harmless). Horse riding is available and the surfers seemed to be enjoying the huge waves.
Baliti4l,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2012,Although we do not surf this beach is fab and lovely surrounding restaurants and a lot quieter than Kuta and Seminyak.  
GinkgoB,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2012,"I agree with Alex U below. I found this beach lovely and peaceful for walking along in both directions - up northwards to Echo Beach and southwards past Berawa, etc. I never actually swam right at the main Canggu beach, as the flags were rarely up at the times I was walking and I didn't really fancy swimming so near a river anyway. It is not a bright white beach, as the sand is a mix of volcanic rock and other matter, but I didn't spot any rubbish or other signs of dirt.The second photo was taken shortly after all the fishing boats had come in and they were just putting up the swimming flags just north of the creek. But mostly there were few people on the beach most times I walked down there from my villa."
RedNeice,"London, UK",May 2012,Possibly the most filthy beach we saw in Bali and the water quality was terrible.  When your skin is itching when you get out it's never a good sign!!
Angie O,"Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia",Jul 2012,"Beach is dirty, nothing much to explore. Good for surfers. Good waves, other than that, nothing else to explore. Not suitable for swimming as too big waves. "
TheStarskys,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2012,"You need the right conditions, but Canggu Beach has some fun peaks for varying levels of ability. Plenty of places to park, and a couple of Warungs for that post-surf Coke or Bali coffee."
EndlessSummer2012,"San Francisco, CA",Aug 2012,"After spending 3 weeks in Bali in 2008, my wife and I decided to come back for a month and stay so I could surf and we could enjoy the island.  Having surfed Bali before (Uluwatu/Bukit) and coming off a surf boat charter in the Maldives, I couldn't wait to get in the water in Bali.  Got to Canggu beach and I admit that it was a bit disappointing.  I felt like I was back at Ocean Beach in San Francisco vs. Bali.  The waves were a combo beach/reef break with long paddle outs and ok waves.  The SE trade winds also came up very early so I had to be up at dawn to get a couple of hours in before the winds were blowing 15-20 MPH side shore.  I should have brought a kite board!  We've made a few trips already down to surf the Bukit because it was too big in Canggu to even paddle out, and it's going off all day with offshores, white sand beaches, and perfect clear blue/green water breaking over consistent reef.  I hate to complain, which I feel like I'm doing...but I had visions of perfect waves that I could surf at any time of the day for the entire month.  I should have done more research...but maybe this will help you.  :-)"
Eddie M,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2012,dirty and poor access to the beach.  We had to walk through a buildingsite to get to it.  there are no facilities anywhere nearby and nowhere to get a drink.
James L,"Phuket, Thailand",Aug 2011,I like to see new thing and meet new peoples. I love travel
Tom R,Helena,Dec 2011,"Good surf, sandy beach, used by the locals, could have beencleaner in places this was in December 2010"
SilviaRobi,"Torino, Italia",May 2012,"wonderful beach, especially with great waves for surfing, relatively clean for Bali"
prg_spion,"Prague, Czech Republic",Nov 2011,"This is definitely a more chill area of Bali - a few hotels/villas have access to this beach and it's just beautiful. Im sure there are better in Bali, but something about the ""end of the road"" vibe of it got to me."
SallyG0Lightly,Brooklyn,Nov 2011,Great place to hang with the girlfriends and have a drink at sunset. Fun place to run into people. 
Jaarman,"Tartu, Estonia",Jan 2012,"Nice place for surfers, but unfortunately a lot of trash on the beach, specially after heavy rains and winds"
DanoCanada,Canada,Dec 2011,"The beach is black volcanic sand, which isn't so bad except it gets too hot. The big problem is the strong surf and pounding waves, which make it unsuitable for swimming or even wading. Construction along the beach is also making it difficult to walk along the beach in some stretches. Stick to the pool!"
JustinRBoyd,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2011,Great spot for surfing and swimming or just relaxing at one of the warongs along the beach and perhaps getting a massage or a Bintang. Canggu beach is very pleasant and has the most spectacular sunsets during November and December.Surf instructors available for beginners and board hire. Entry to the parking area is Rp2000
Aussie_Nate,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2011,The sand here is black.The people on and around the beach area are very friendly.There is plenty of swimming area but be careful when the swell is up as rips can start very veyr quickly and can be quite vicious.
