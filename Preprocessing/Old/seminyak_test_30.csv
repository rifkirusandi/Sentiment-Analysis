Jan 2017,"I was in Seminyak in the winter 2014 and was already shocked then by the incredibly dirty beach and ocean. The sewage is running straight into the sea on various points along the beach. This has not changed at all from my first visit. The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!! Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror. We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time.

The sand is very black and you end up with dirty feet. There's heaps of dogs so obviously they urinate and poop on the beach (we saw this happen a bit) so you need to be careful when you're walking. The local people have lounges that you can rent during the day and beanbags at night. There are lots of people coming up to you and trying to sell you things so it's not overly relaxing. There's always places to rent boards from or learn to surf and places where you can get a drink of you want. The beach isn't very clean and there's lots of rubbish and offerings floating/blowing around.

Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of ‚Äúsand on, stress off‚Äù after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn‚Äôt hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you‚Äôll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‚Äòmovers and shakers‚Äô, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‚Äòescape‚Äô and you‚Äôll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.

If I had children there is no way I would allow them to swim in those waters.  The first couple weeks the beaches were much the same, some days much worse than others. There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions. Sometimes we can be too quick to judge a place. Sadly for some we met, they only had a few days or a week to visit it at it‚Äôs worse.",first glance upon arrival walk beach seminyak legian kuta back reaction kidding word come mind sad pathetic tragedy travel filthiest visit number surfer take lesson others swim child way allow swim water first couple week beaches much day much bad others many plastic wash ashore horrific expect seminyak almost one month every day make point walk three beach day local rake seem endless task day saw payloader tractor bucket transport trash designate area make large pile speak local explain rainy season especially high tide wind current carry trash several river ocean onto fortunate catch beach clean water clear cloudy luxury time visit place change attitude assumption sometimes quick judge place sadly meet day week visit worse,"{'neg': 0.186, 'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.9477}",-0.9477,negative

Apr 2017,"This is for anyone visiting,  or thinking of visiting Seminyak this year (2017).These are only our own opinions based on our recent holiday there. GETTING THERE: Most people will arrive via Denpasar Airport, and from the arrivals hall you'll enter a very busy area with hordes of people holding name boards,  and even more taxi drivers vying for your business.  My advice here is to ensure that you've pre-booked a taxi through your hotel. Your (c30 min) journey to your Seminyak hotel will then be easier and probably less expensive.  Our pre-booked taxi cost ¬£15.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok, Denpasar and environs is never going to win any beauty awards, if you're familiar with the Far East then the ramshackle set-up, the huge volume of crazily driven scooters, and the antithesis to Western order won't come as a shock, but if Bali is your first time east of the Mediterranean then be patient and stick with it.  Seminyak has been designed for enjoyment whilst Denpasar is a capital city with few reasons to linger.Seminyak is quite compact and this review only encompasses this area and not Kuta. The vast majority of the accommodation in town is either beach facing,  or a short walk from the beach.HOTELS: Whilst we can only comment specifically on one, the excellent Taum Resort, we saw enough of the others during our stay to build a very favourable opinion on standards,  most were 4* and quite a few the vaunted 5* quality, and they looked every inch comparable with the best beach hotels in Europe. We saw a number of very smart beachfront hotels with sun decks, pools and lovingly manicured gardens, where the almost daily stunning sunsets could be enjoyed in blissful surroundings. NIGHTLIFE : This is where Seminyak scores highly.  It's set-up for people who like to enjoy life once the sun goes down - but that said,  it's not trying to be an Ibiza. We felt that the beating heart of Seminyak was given over to couples,  irrespective of age (we're 40's and 50's), and testimony to this were the range of other couples that we met during our stay; the vast majority being Australian  (3 hrs flight from Perth for example ). Lots of 'gap year' youngsters and 'Eat, Pray, Love' wannabe types looking for adventure or love (or both). They'd all gravitated to the right place, heaps of great bars and restaurants and enough high-end nightspots to please every taste,  budget and preference,  most people will have heard of Potato Head and Ku De Ta etc, they're very good as you'd expect, but look beyond them and the supporting cast will enthrall you and your money will go a long way. Although just examples and exchange rates will fluctuate, you'll find most bars trying to lure you in with 2-1 cocktails or 2-1 Happy Hour deals for around (UK) ¬£1.50 for the beer (Bintang is the excellent local beer) and ¬£3 for the cocktails,  compare this to London prices and you'll be in the slightly unusual position of feeling mildly wealthy.  Eating out bears similar fruit and we enjoyed some brilliant food in extremely atmospheric restaurants for Wetherspoons type prices! For a couple of personal recommendations try La Laguna, Ginger Moon, Batik, Grocer & Grind,  but there are nany more as good.  In short then, tons of choice,  fantastic service wherever you go,  and very kind on your pocket  (have you booked yet?).SAFETY: This one comes in two parts.  If you're reading this and you're an adult,  or going with other adults,  then this will be the safest place you've ever been unless you drink too much,  if you get drunk then at some point you're likely to fall foul of the 2-wheeled 24/7 carnage that is the half a billion scooters that compete for space on the narrow Seminyak streets, these things are literally everywhere and at times the lunatic drivers (term used loosely ) will mount the kerb and use the footpath. Many of the scooters appear to be carrying at least 3 generations of the same family and they'll all have aboard items such as ladders, power saws, live animals and the sort of stuff we'd need a Qashqai to transport. We took photos of the aforementioned just because we figured the folks back home wouldn't believe us! Crossing the road in Bali would be classed as a dangerous sport in the Uk, but help is normally on hand courtesy of the ubiquitous security guards, who guard everything.  They all carry illuminated batons and make full use of the whistles that they also carry, if they spot that you're struggling to cross the road then they're out there in a jiffy to see you safely across.  Top boys.The pavements are hilarious in that one minute they're there,  and then the next minute they've either ended abruptly at a large chasm,  or a  set of neck height power lines (not kidding) ,  or....the pavement just reappears on the opposite side of the street. So, given the last point,  I'd implore any parents with babies,  toddlers,  or pre-teen children to take a holiday elsewhere,  because we saw so many anguished parents frantically trying to either control their kids next to the Nurbergring town roads,  or trying to stop enough of the wacky races participants in order to get to the other side,  hugely dangerous and quite disturbing to see. Bali is lovely but small children brought up with UK road sense are in peril here.Like I said earlier, sensible adults will have no issues here. BEACH : This was a shock to us. When we booked our holiday we of course Googled Bali (Seminyak) beach images,  and feasted our eyes on the stunning shots. In reality there are times when the long Seminyak Beach is quite the opposite. In the wet season it rains regularly and when it does the stuff cones down in torrents,  add to this the generally observed habit of throwing most litter into the gutter,  then you'll quickly realise that all of the litter is quickly washed into surface water culverts that themselves wash into the small rivers that flow through the town. These then run straight into the sea,  and the tide deposits the whole lot on the tide line early doors the next morning! ! Take a beach stroll on the morning after one of the regular evening thunderstorms and you'll see what I mean.; absolutely shocking mess and not safe for walking on as you can imagine.  The Balinese seem to employ a small army of people (many wearing face masks and PPE) plus tractors to try and make good this mess every day.  When this has been done then large swathes of the beach do justice to the brochure images,  but just be aware that at times the beach can be quite awful and there has to be some effort made to try and improve the littering situation which I have to say is more down to the locals,  than the visitors!TAXIS: Worthy of its own section,  the town is chock full of taxis and this whirring convoy just seems to endlessly circulate around the centre (AKA Seminyak Square) looking for anyone 'walking '. We deduced that when Balinese taxi drivers take their training course their first instruction is the assumption that someone walking is in dire need of a fare-paying lift! From the second you creep beyond the wall of your hotel EVERY taxi driver will hit his horn and slow down,  many will stop and wind down their window and wait for you to agree that 'yes....you can't possibly walk 100 metres to the beach / bar / shop, and that you need a lift'.  The trick is to either smile and carry on walking, or just ignore them. Both methods work equally well but the good news is that these guys aren't the least bit pushy or aggressive. You get used to the patter and we assume that they get used to just driving around all day.That said, be advised of the ongoing scams. The ONLY officially licensed taxis are Blue Bird. That doesn't help you with recognition because in Bali EVERY taxi is blue and the same model  (Toyota ) as the official ones!  Also many of the unlicensed taxis have the name 'Blue XXXX' that look almost identical to the pucker version. The difference being that if you ride in a dodgy taxi then the driver will either say ""meter not working"", or when you arrive at your destination,  he will say ""no change"". The latter is a patent lie of course, and if you enter a taxi with ""broken meter "" then get straight out. We of course fell fowl of both on day one, but a very helpful 'official ' Blue Bird driver apprised us of the dark side of Seminyak taxis on day two,  citing that unlicensed drivers face fines if caught with dodgy meters or if they're discourteous to customers.  In summary we found the whole taxi topic amusing,  and I'd also add that almost every driver  stopped or slowed down if they saw that we wanted to cross the street.In terms of fares. From our hotel to either the beach or Seminyak Square,  both a 30 min walk,  we'd pay the minimum evening fare of IDR 30.OOO. Which worked out at ¬£2 at the March exchange rate of IDR 16000 to ¬£1. MONEY: I've alluded to the generally very agreeable cost of eating and drinking out, taxis I've also said are cheap,  and with a total absence of other means of public transport you might want to engage your hotel in finding a locally recommended driver. We hired a friendly driver who took us all around the island for ¬£30 per day, try doing that in the UK and you'll be adding another '0', fantastic value and all of the drivers speak good English  (as do almost all Balinese ).There are numerous ATM's dotted around Seminyak and my wife and I used different ATM's with our respective banks and the exchange rates worked out at broadly the same as the exchange rates that we'd been given prior to setting off from the UK. If you're a single female traveller and are conscious of security with your cards / money then there are a couple of cash machines inside the new shopping mall in Seminyak Square, the latter housing some good shops,  but tons of better ones that aren't generic 'high street' around the town that are well worth a look.  THE PEOPLE : If you've been to Thailand then you'll be sitting there thinking that 'nobody is friendlier than the Thai's', I know you're thinking that because we thought so, too. But come here and you'll be truly in the presence of the nicest people on God's green Earth. We were humbled by their humility,  their values,  their sheer desire to make a difference to your day. The service we received in every single venue, bar, hotel, or even total strangers in the street was so genuine,  so wonderful,  that to not come back to Bali would be a crime. Come and see for yourself,  if you've been promising yourself  / husband / wife / partner to take a trip to Bali then go to your bank tomorrow,  or beg a wealthy relative for funds,  sell that useless artefact or trade-in the boat you never used,  and drag your weary body to this temple of soul salvation, I promise you that you will enjoy every moment and you'll return to our embittered crime -ridden soulless country a better person.SEMINYAK: Yes it's a fabulous destination.  It's not without its faults and I'd advocate it's not fit for young children or the infirm,  but if your mojo has lost its sparkle then this is the place to lift your spirits. Great hotels, great nightlife, and incredible people. WEATHER: There are two main seasons in Bali. Hot and wet and hot and dry. We came end of March which is towards the end of the wet season. We had rain almost every day but in the main the rain and thunderstorms came late afternoon or during the night. When it rains it comes down in torrents but the temperature doesn't drop,  meaning it gets very humid. When the sun comes out it's blistering hot and most days the mercury will climb up to 32c (90f in old money ) and often beyond. The actual temperature feels hotter so the 'real feel' in the daytime is more like 40c (104f). Bear that in mind if you're fair skinned!  At night the thermometer rarely dips below 25c (77f) so you'll not need to bring outer layers here save for a rain mac. What disappointed me was the appalling lack of weather forecast detail available online in the lead up to our holiday.  The BBC didn't feature a single location on Bali,  others just gave a  generic 'cut and paste ' tropics forecast, and the go-to Wunderground  (Weather Underground ) gave pessimistic forecasts which simply stated ""cloud,  frequent thunderstorms "" for most of the days we were there,  and whilst 'yes' we did get some cloud and some storms,  the latter's forecasts made no mention of the 5-6 hours of blazing sunshine that we got each day. Only one day out of 12 was 'bang on' their prediction. So I'm saying don't take too much notice of the forecasts before you come out here,  they're not accurate enough!  Have a great time.

Aug 2019,The Money Changers here scam you with posting high rates outside their doors. When you give them a  $100 Bill they will keep it on top of the counter and pile up the Indonesian Rupiah bills on the counter. The conversion is approximately 1.4 million and change. This they will convert in 50000 Rupiah notes which will amount to between 28 to 30 notes per $100. They will then pick up the notes to hand you the pile and will CRAFTILY PULL OUT a large chunk of the notes. The bigger the amount the easier it is for them to pull out more notes. An unsuspecting traveler will put the money in their purse or pocket and later realise that they were scammed. In our case we changed $500 and our due amount was 7.35 million. They handed us a shade over 5 million. We realised this when we arrived at the hotel.

Dec 2018,"(written after 1st day, update after that)After starting our Bali trip in Sanur, where the beach was clean, with zero plastic and crystal, still waters, the Seminyak beach DUMP was a shocking experience!A very nice, classic monumental beach, tens of kilometres long, and more than 50 m wide, with this solid, easy-walking sand, BUT FULL OF PLASTIC! Both the beach and the water as well. And small rivers bring sewage, nauseous.Could not swim at all, so ugly! Fortunately we had such a nice villa, we could stay there.About this disaster we discussed for long with our villa manager. Well, he said that the beach is not such all the time, but twice a year. Then there is certain wind, that now started blowin 4 days ago, and it brings a lot of wood pieces and plastic ashore.Usually lasts around a week. Good thing to see, compared to eg. Thailand, was to see, that there was an army of government paid workers cleaning beach, and trucks driving the waste away. On our 1 hour walk I think we saw more than hundred workers on a 2km strip of beach.Still, it will last days for the sea to vommit all the carbage to the land for them to pick up.I asked where is the litter from, and the manager told us, it is from ther rivers, namely Balis own rivers, not coming further away. He said there is a lot going on in Bali to tackle the issue, but the change is slow, and presumed it take at least one lifetime. They do realize that tourists won't come if it is not clean!And, maybe tourists have already started to shun Bali as both in Sanur and in Seminyak it was really quite, the restaurants empty all night etc.?They are banning the plastic straws already, which is a start, but most of the plastic litter seems to be smaller than plastic bags, these everyday wrappers for food. Why do we need to wrap a single sweet into plastic?(updated after the second last day)Well, during the last day, the beach seemed cleaner, the armies of cleaners had succeeded and it seemed less new trash coming. However, when standing in the sea knee deep, almost every wave brouht ugly things to skin...(updated after the last day)The situation got even better, less crap.

The waves are not huge but do much more than lap at the edges so the area attracts bodyboarders and the like.  The beach runs for quite a while so it is worth picking the right spot.  A good option is in front of Ku De Ta as it seems to be a bit cleaner than some other parts.  Sunbeds are available but are quite pricey, it is just as easy to use a towel instead.The beach does have a fair few people but nowhere near as many as crowd into Kuta.  This is not the leisure of isolation but equally is not overcrowded.Cleanliness is always an issue on Bali beaches but it isn't terrible.
