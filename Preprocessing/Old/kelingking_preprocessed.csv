Nov 2019,"Firstly, the road to get to this place is very reasonable compared to many in Penida.  That’s a bonus.  So you could scooter from the harbour to hear no worries. Now this place was just to beautiful.  There are many viewing spots for this place.  You can pay a 5000rp donation to go up to a viewing platform which I did and stayed there as it was magnificent.  I launched the drone from up there too.  I did lose some gps a bit when I went high so had to bring it down a bit.  Plus I am not a very experienced drone pilot. There are monkeys here too so if you’re scared get someone to shoe them away for you.  There’s plenty of warungs to eat or drink at.  Parking tip - they charge and then point you to a parking area, however you can ride closer down and park elsewhere.  This is an absolute must see in Penida.

Oct 2019,"Its a long review but here is what I feel There is a lot of debate on whether you should trek down to the Kelingking beach or not. Lot of vloggers have posted their videos online on the same topic and there are conflicting views on it. For me it was the trek which made all the difference. I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 9:30 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly. Every 5 minutes take a pause and just look around the surroundings , then you will realise why I am asking you to trek down. Once you reach down then you will see an absolutely gorgeous beach with so strong waves . This is what I am talking about. ..

Sep 2019,"Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins) and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot... This is dingy with rats on the rafters and you can select from 2 meals being the cheapest on the menu... This part was private as it was just me and my mum with our driver. Please take travel sickness tablets with you!!! The roads are next level horrible... I've travelled a fair bit and I have never seen roads this bad... I got car sickness in about 15 minutes... And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us.

Sep 2019,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn.

The turquoise water attracted both of us and we couldn't hold ourself getting down the beach. It was very risky to go down, very stiff and narrow path. However we went down there and it took about 1 hour. After getting down there you will feel that yes the effort comming down worth it. The big waves and white sands are mind blowing.As the waves were big i didn't dive into but my husband went for swim. Unfortunately i was just standing nearby and feeling the waves touching my feets, suddenly a very stong wave came and just made me fall down. I was not able to getup and within a fraction of second it took me away deep.I thought i was dead. My husband came to fetch me but along with me he was also drowning. Thanks to the other foreign visitors those helped both of us from being drowned. 4 of them dragged both of us simultaneously. It was so dangerous and i was very scared. I'll never forget this accident. So guys please dont swim in high tides not even stand nearby the waves.Thanks to Almighty for saving both of us.Then all of them encouraged us and half an hour later we decided to climb up. It took 1.5 hours to climb up and was too sunny. Very hard to climp up, no shadows , no place to take rest. But the place was really very beautiful. A must visit in Nusa Penida. Suggestions:1.

Jun 2019,"Honestly, 100 times better if you go while staying on the island and not as a day trip. We arrived around 9 am. Paid 11,000 per two people (including parking scooter)There were only a dozen or so people. Plenty of space to enjoy the view and take pictures. We decided to take the grueling stairs down- I'm not going to lie it is steep! But a nice challenge, if you are looking for a good work out it's worth it. But once we got down we weren't sure the point of heading down. The beach is nice, but you can't swim. So we didn't really see the point of going down in the end.

May 2019,"Kelingking Beach is a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island. You can enjoy one of the most breath-taking views over the hills and small strip of white sand from atop a hill of the same name. The sight features a limestone headland covered in green, against the deep blue waters of the open Indian Ocean. This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‘T-Rex Bay’. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it’s during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you’ve reached the sand, you’ll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated.

Given, I'm a rock climber who's in pretty good shape, but the steps are worn into the rock and the hand railing is solid up until the last maybe 100m, when you should test it before pulling hard. I wouldn't do it in flip flops, but I found my running sandals worked fine -- sneakers would've prevented me from feeling the rock. But if you're scared of heights, have knee problems, or aren't physically fit, probably skip the climb down. At the bottom of the climb is the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. Perfect white sand flecked with pieces of coral, a massive cavern on one side of the beach, and the T-Rex cliff on the other. The waves are big, strong, shore breakers and there is a fairly hefty rip current.

We took a tour that visit 4 places in Nusa Penida which include the boat trip to the island and car transfer to each site. The downside is that you cant stay too  long at each place around 30mins to 45mins most. If you really want to enjoy Kelingking beach and climb down to the beach it is recommended to get get your own transfer once arrive in the island. The tour I bought was west trip package.from 630am and get back at hotel at 6pm.The road is really bad and its a 40mins super bumpy ride to Kelingking Beach.

Mar 2019,"First of all, don’t do the day trip. You must stay on this beautiful untouched island for a few days to really appreciate Nusa Penida. We came to Kelingking twice - once around 8am to take photos from the top and fly the drone. A good time to get here before the cars full of tourists turn up (usually between 830-9) From this we then planned to walk all the way down to the beach a few mornings later and we started our walk at 7am. I’d advise getting there as early as this or even earlier to firstly hike in the cooler weather before it gets too hot and secondly so you can have the whole beach to yourself! Truly amazing.The hike itself is tough. We are both athleticly for and found it a challenge. It’s mostly rock climbing and if the weather has been raining the night before it’s very slippery. Make sure you wear trainers and sensible clothes. The halfway point hike isn’t too bad but to carry on after this and go to the beach is where it gets hard. There are ropes to help guide you down but once you’re down it’s so beautiful. Litter-free, supersoft sand and clear water. Not safe enough to swim in but still stunning.

Feb 2019,"The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. Kelingking beach is located on Nusa Penida, with is a separate island located about 30 minutes by boat from Sanur, Bali. Nusa Penida is still undeveloped, and I would recommend spending a few nights here to really enjoy the island. Another option would be staying on Nusa Lembongan which is only a 5 minute boat ride away from Penida, it has more accommodation options available (in total their are 3 Nusa Islands all located next to each other). Note: It's takes about 30 minutes to get down to the actual beach at Kelingking, but around 1-1.5 hrs to climb back up. The stairs are steep and rocky, not the easiest climb. Their are hand rails most of the way, would not recommend the climb for anyone with mobility or endurance issues. Many people simply come and take pictures from the top without ever climbing down to the water. And that works fine for all fitness/mobility levels. It's a very popular spot, get there early if you can to avoid the crowds. Nusa Penida is amazing, this isn't a spot to rush through in one day. They have tons of great beaches (like crystal bay), great snorkeling, and landmarks like angels billabong, broken beach, etc. The roads to get around the island are in pretty bad shape.

I hike quite often back home in Western Canada, so I felt pretty confident doing it until I slipped and fell and cut up my elbows. Then entire way down, shaking legs and thoughts of “oh god I’m going to die here.” I advice anyone doing this hike: if you struggled in the first half of the hike which is until the dinosaur’s back and then u turn towards the beach and start going down to do other half. TURN back! So can get some very pretty pictures from there because the second half down is soooo much worse and extremely steep with very tight spacing which makes it very tricky when ur going down and ppl are coming up. Some ppl were doing the hike bare feet to get better grip which might be an idea worth trying?!?Once you get down to the beach, it is pure paradise. Can’t swim in it but the massive waves are beautiful to see and there is a tiny stand down there serving drinks which is cool. Can’t believe they go up/down that hike every day with merchandise.

Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able. I could have done it in flip flops, but I didn't want to ditch my husband lol.Beyond the actual views, there are a bunch of warungs where you can get food and drink, fresh coconut, etc. We did have to pay a small fee (15,000? 11,000 IDR?) to park our motorbike there as well, which was fine. The road to the actual beach is not paved and needs some serious work -- the east side of the island, in comparison, is *much* nicer in that regard.

Oct 2018,"One of the best and most terrifying experiences of my life... My boyfriend and I tackled the hike down to the beach at about 9am. Not too busy at this time but still people around. The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4.

Oct 2018,"It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida. It requires good physical condition to go up, down and up again, especially under the tropical sun. It's located quite far, 1,5 hour approximately from Sampalan, the main port to reach Nusa Penida from Sanur. Because of its popularity, to avoid the crowd, I suggest you to be here around 8 am. The earliest fast boat leaves Sanur at 7.30 with 45 minutes travel duration. So people start coming from Bali main island from 10 am approx. It'd be ideal if you spend a night in Nusa Penida and arrive early in Kelingking beach. So you can enjoy the white sandy, secluded beach on your own for some time. You take steepy stairs to go down that only fit for one person. In the busy hours, people make quite long queue waiting to go up or down in turns, one by one. The shower room isn't available on the beach, it's on the cliff. You should pay 5000 IDR to use the shower room/toilet.I wonder how grand the view would be during sunset time. If you spend a night in Nusa Penida, you can try to watch sunset here. Altough the lack of street light and poor condition of asphalt in some parts throughout the journey would be a challenge.And dear my fellow travellers, please mind your trash.

So we did althought the wooden thing didn't look so special. When we came down, the local lady was asking us for 5 k per person. It was written with a shaky handwriting on a very little sign next to the ladders. We paid, as it isn't that much, but I just felt fooled. I feel like this kind of ""take a picture here and pay 5/10 k"" are just one big scam. Entrance fees are okay if the proceeds go into the maintenance/property management, but otherwise...

Jul 2018,"Kelingking beach is just something you have to see to believe, it is amazing. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the manta rays swimming around at the beach below. A few things to note:The road out to Kelingking is rough, if you decide to do it on a scooter you should be careful as there are a lot of bumps, rocks, soft sand and taxis to contend with. I have heard that the taxi/tour van ride out is quite rough also but if you aren't confident on a scooter then I suggest taking a tour or taxi.This is the number one attraction on Nusa Penida so it gets very busy, if you stay on the island I recommend going early before the boats bring in day tourists.The best view is from the top, but you can hike down to the beach but be warned that it is not an easy one, I recommend wearing sneakers/runners for extra grip and just for feet protection.Areas of the hike down are super steep and quite difficult to negotiate so take your time. Plenty of people do this hike so there are sections where you will have to stop and wait to let people pass you. Be considerate of others and lend them a hand when it's safe to do so. This is a cliffs side you are climbing down which has little shade and sometimes no wind so it gets very hot. Once you make it down to the beach, there is one person who is selling some drinks and snacks but don't expect to have a wide variety and you will pay slightly more then you would normally. It would be wise to take some water and snacks with you. The beach is not necessarily a swim friendly beach, no life guards patrol the beach, the waves can be quite big and come from different directions. If you aren't a strong swimmer I highly advise you don't go in very deep. I swam out into the water and got to swim with some rays which was awesome. It was hard to get in and out safely and I am a strong swimmer.This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so if you do decide to do it.

Jun 2018,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here.

Since I'm in a rush of hour to go other places, maybe next time I'll do it.Overall, it takes around 30 min from Nusa Penida port to Kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do off-road.

Hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. 🙏🏻Besides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited.

We reached Kelingking took a couple photos and without hesitation made our way down towards the beach.

It is also extremely hot so take a lot of water, but don't pack too much as the climb back up the mountain can become extremely difficult if you have a lot to carry. Once you do get down to the bottom you can not enter the water, as it is dangerously rough, the waves are huge and crash right on the shore with that much power that even standing meters away you are almost swept off your feet. We were also lucky enough to be able to purchase some water and beers down the bottom as well. We made the silly mistake of drinking a beer before the climb back up which we both regretted as the climb is so hard and with a beer in your belly you do not feel good. The climb back up was exhausting, and we almost passed out from the heat a couple of times because there is absolutely no relief from the sun and we started the climb back up at 12:30 - 1:00 pm.

Mar 2018,"I had been wanting to visit Nusa Penida after seeing the beautiful pictures everywhere and realizing it was just 30 minutes from Bali where I was going on vacation this past week. The reviews are accurate - this isn't an easy place to get to, and the climb is not easy either - but the view is worth it. I have never seen a place like this in my life and it IS breathtaking. We booked a tour which included a fast boat from Sanur beach to Nusa Penida and then a driver picked us up and drove us there. We could have rented motorbikes or just a taxi, but we weren't sure and were limited on time so we just got a tour guide. The fast boat was about 45 minutes, and once we arrived our tour guide immediately picked us up and started driving up Nusa Penida to the beach, which was about a 45 minute drive through long, winding, and needless to say bumpy roads. Once we arrived the views were incredible and it wasn't too touristy which was great. We decided to start the trek down, and about halfway we stopped to turn back around. To be completely honest, my legs still hurt 3 days later from the hike (and I didn't even go all the way). The hike down is not paved and has rocks and some wood to help guide you, but it's definitely scary and treacherous. I do regret not going all the way down, so if you have time - I would recommend trying it if you are fit and in shape. For me, it was about 90 degrees and I was absolutely exhausted, so I was scared about going all the way down and turned around even though I wish I hadn't.

Dec 2017,"If you have time to spend in Bali, please pay a visit to Nusa Penida. This island is just amazingly stunning. It has multiple beaches with jaw-dropping views, totally worth to visit. One of the great options is Kelingking Beach, or the locals used to call it as Karang Dewa. It is only 45 minutes from the Nusa Penida pier by a motorbike. You can easily rent a motorbike, or hire a cab there. Totally easy.The view was completely amazing, as you can see from many pictures here. However, do not go down to the beach if you are not feeling well. It was noon (around 1 am), when I decided to go down to the beach. Actually, the locals put a warning there to not go down because the track was very steep (yeah, 90-degree cliff) it was just like a wall-climbing without any safety rope, and without any safety guards. Going down is totally at your own risk. Also, consider the time to go down and back up. When I went down it was 1 pm and it was extremely hot and even my sunblock couldn’t prevent me from sunburn. The beach itself was actually very nice, and you can swim and enjoy the view for hours. Don’t forget to bring drinks and foods because there is no food stall down there. But please, I repeat, please bring back your trash up there. If you could, please also bring some other trash there. Unfortunately, there were so many trash on the beach. It was sad to find those trash in such paradise. Overall, the place is totally worth to visit. Take some pictures, enjoy the sun, smell the breeze, and drink some coconut.

The place has become super popular on social media and tourists are quickly starting to know where this secret gem is. At the top of the trail, there are a lot of tourists (with they annoying selfie sticks) blocking the whole view and they will not move for you to get a good photo, so I suggest ignore this area and make it down to the beach like the proper travellers.

Jun 2017,"We chartered a speed boat out of Sanur Semawang beach and travelled for 45 minutes to Crystal Bay. This is one of the popular dive site to look for mola mola or sun fish. But this was not a dive trip so we jumped to the white sandy beach and a car already waited for us. The driving time to kelingking beach took about an hour because the road condition was not perfect. Once we arrived, the spectacular view made you forget all the bumpy and slow drive. The view from above the cliff was just amazing, perfect for picture taking. We could walk down 100 meter to the beach but decided not to because I was not sure we can climb back up. The best approach would be to walk down the cliff and leave by boat from the beach below.",charter speed boat sanur semawang travel 45 minute crystal bay one popular dive site look mola mola sun fish dive trip jump white sandy car already wait u drive time kelingking take hour road condition perfect arrive spectacular view make forget bumpy slow drive view cliff amaze perfect picture take walk 100 meter decide sure climb back best approach walk cliff leave boat,"{'neg': 0.04, 'neu': 0.699, 'pos': 0.261, 'compound': 0.959}",0.959,positive
Jun 2017,"Kelingking Beach is about 30 mins from Crystal Beach by scooter. The middle part of the journey is quite bumpy due to the notoriously pothole-filled roads, which get better closer to the destination. Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat). I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled). Both the descent and ascent are quite laborious, and the pocari sweat back up top was welcomed gladly. This experience was unbelievable. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Jun 2017,This is the most dangerously beautiful place I have ever seen or been. Climbing down 2000 feet of raw cliff via slippery spots with a small bamboo rail and rope is no small task for a guy afraid of heights.

Jun 2017,Need to be in decent shape to do this. We went to the bottom. It was not an easy hike. It was short but very tough coming from the bottom. Practically wall climbing - using more of your arms then legs at first. Incredible sights from every point during the hike.

Apr 2017,Beautiful cliff and horizon view. Located less than an hour by car from Angel's Billabong / Broken Beach. You can enjoy the view from above or you can go down to the beach with a note; you have to be in good condition. It requires a great stamina to go steep 500-700ft down and climb back. At some point your knee will be in front of your belly while climbing up the steep stairs (if it can be called so). The path also not really safe since there was no fence/net/bar good enough to prevent accident.,beautiful cliff view locate less hour car angel billabong broken enjoy view go note good condition require great stamina go steep climb back point knee will front belly climb steep stair call path really safe good enough prevent accident,"{'neg': 0.106, 'neu': 0.494, 'pos': 0.4, 'compound': 0.9459}",0.9459,positive
