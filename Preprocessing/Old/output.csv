ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"Initially the black sands of Canggu Beach are quite novel. As this spot has become THE place to be in Bali, crowds have blemished what once might have been pristine and serene. Plenty of waves to surf and hip bars to visit - the beach seems to be perennially packed these days."
Cherie H,"Roumazieres-Loubert, France",Dec 2019,"Unfortunately this gorgeou beach was covered in rubbish. The little food and drink places along the edge of the walkway were friendly and if looking for basic food , nice views and cold drinks its a great spot. The laid back atmosphere and lovely locals makes is favourite spot though when visiting Bali. We stay here for 1/2 of our Bali trip. "
Anastasia B,6 contributions,Jul 2019,"Canggu Beach was wonderful and exactly what I wanted for my vacation. I spent three weeks at an Air Bnb that was in walking distance. My criteria: good surfing waves and yoga. The waves: LOVED them. They came in reliably in perfect sets. Wave after wave after wave, and it's a beach break so you don't have to worry about getting killed on the reef. They are long, firm waves, perfect for long boarding. There are enough waves for everyone, and the locals are very nice, friendly, and laid-back. You can rent boards on the beach, or bring your own. The Yoga: There are several yoga studios close by, but I preferred to do my own ashtanga practice before or after surfing, at my air bnb or on the beach.The Beach: Beautiful with deep blue water and a lovely sky. There are stray dogs which will break your heart, but they are not dangerous."
Therese Herlihy,"Dublin, Ireland",Dec 2019,We knew this was not a white sandy beach but the beach itself had lots of rubbish on it and was so noisy from lots of drunk people in the various bars dotted along the front. Much nicer beaches elsewhere in Bali.
Mark Jones,"Lake Macquarie, Australia",Sep 2019,"Always find you will get a wave at Canggu (and surrounds) without as much hassle as the more renowned breaks on the other side of the penninsula...you all know the breaks, but you also know how its not as much fun anymore. (MJ)"
Mansi Reddy,"Chennai (Madras), India",Oct 2019,"After visiting Seminyak in Bali you can definitely see a contrast in Canggu. This is a new and developing neighbourhood with lots of restaurants, bars and cafes. I can see why the younger crowd gravitate here for budget conscious options. Black sand beach with plenty of choice for beachside activities."
Clo,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,"Certain areas are not that tastefullStick to the private beaches as best you can.Feet were black walking from place to place,  Some parts were fab, but just know where to go"
Gavin,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2019,"a great sunset from here, very wide beach front, watch out for the strong currents from here, can be quite rough at times"
Kaye,"Long Beach, CA",Dec 2019,"If you want a super Western style beach, this is your place. Being from California, I was expecting a very special type of place after hearing that Canggu was voted one of the best beaches in the world, but it was EXACTLY like a California beach. All of the restaurants were catered towards Western cuisine, the most unauthentic part of Bali I'd seen in the whole 3 weeks my boyfriend and I were there."
Jenny,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2019,You don't go to Bali for the beaches! Not compared to Australia. its peaceful and nice in the mornings and lots of street dogs hang out and will say hello. Good for surfing but not swimming. 
SingaporeBms,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Wide open beach with very good surf conditions throughout the day.  Ample food and drink restaurants available along the beach.  
–ï–∫–∞—Ç–µ—Ä–∏–Ω–∞ –ü–∞—Ä—à—É—Ç–∏–Ω–∞,9 contributions,Dec 2019,"Good just for surfing. Not clean and relaxing. You can take a surf in the rentals points, with all equipment "
Triana L,Los Angeles,Dec 2019,"If you‚Äôre looking for the idyllic, white sand beach and turquoise blue waters in a tranquil setting, this isn‚Äôt it. If you‚Äôre looking for great surfing, look no further. This beach offers lots of beach club options, vendors, seating areas and service for drinks. There are big crowds on the sand and in the water, likely for the perfect waves and party atmosphere."
zakwebb47,"London, UK",Nov 2019,"The beach is very nice, and absolutely stunning to watch sunsets from (highly recommend!). It is great for surfers as it has fairly big waves (probably a good size for new surfers), but for swimming it's not so good, but overall it's good and I would give it 4/5. "
jlct67,27 contributions,Jul 2019,"Canggu was one of favorite places in the whole world! I had read tons and tons of forums trying to figured out which beach town  I wanted to go to and finally decided on Canggu.  I could not imagine going anywhere else now!! It was the perfect place if you're a young professional looking for a bit of night life without the party scene.  Everywhere felt new, clean, and the perfect mix of boho/Balinese culture.  We stayed in an Air BnB right off the main drive but in a fairly quiet space and it was PERFECT.  Walking distance to the beach, Love Anchor, Crate Cafe, and any restaurant or happy hour you could desire.  We moved locations half way through our trip to another city and actually took a taxi back to Canggu on our last day because we just couldn't get enough! This magical little space full of beautiful shops, beaches, happy hours, scooters, and the most magical humans is one for the books.  Grab a cheap beer at Echo Beach Club, a bucket of fries, and watch the sunset to end each day.  It doesn't get better!"
Colmich,"Warners Bay, Australia",Oct 2019,Not sure what the attraction is with this beach as there are so many better beaches to go to and I wouldn't go back 
HolidayDaydreamer,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2019,"I hung around the pool at my hotel as the beach was really average; beach clubs pumping conflicting and annoying music, packs of dogs defecating near the lounge chairs. To be avoided, in my opinion."
Nanamousaka,"Trowbridge, UK",Nov 2019,I will never stop wanting to come back. Incredible for surfing. We went in October and quite strong swimmers but there were many days where the red flags were out for swimmers. The rip tide is so strong. Not safe to swim for weak swimmers or children. Observe the flags and signs first. 
SkiMom33,"Bellingham, Washington",Nov 2019,I loved hanging out here. It is absolutely stunning.  Did some surf lessons and had a great time in general. Amazing Sunsets!!
Linda M,31 contributions,Aug 2019,Fabuloud beach. With lots of food and drink options...comfortable seating is available everywhere and the service is impeccable...wonderful surfing
Monica S,"Joinville, SC",Nov 2019,One more hot surfing spot. Good waves and of course a little bit crowded. Better than spend time in the sand is take time in some of the restaurants and cafes much cool and good view üòä
Popi D,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2018,"Black sands where you can walk for miles into the horizon. Great for long walks and surfing, but I don't think I would swim in it though. The views from above in the beautiful cafe's and restaurants are divine! Also there is a big wall all the way around with the local Graffiti art, well worth the photo's, there are some very talented people out there. Well worth it to see it at least once."
Donal M,"Cork, Ireland",Oct 2019,"Good service from the lounge rental/surf board rental/ bars at the back. Nice laid back staffNot the nicest sand. Looked good for surfing, but that's not what I was there for. Be careful of urchins here because there are several Rocky patches as you walk out into the water that they inhabit. Not suitable for snorkelling, average for swimming. Grand for sitting and having a drink. Beautiful for sunset"
Jay Richters,7 contributions,Oct 2019,Echo beach club has great seafood and is right on the beach! The lobster is to die for! I will be dining there again next time I go there as it is such good food and great value. Cocktails are also great.
Prof. Andrew John y Fernandes,"Valenzuela, Philippines",Oct 2019,The ‚Äúnew‚Äù Seminyak Beach already looks older as it is dirty with rubbish and teeming with unmonitored activity. Mediocre surfing beach
Panji Hagarayu,"Canggu, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"There is no doubt, Bali has many beautiful beaches. One of them is Canggu. Nice to visit here. The waves are also very suitable for surfers."
Iliakylie,Singapore,Oct 2019,This is a must go if you come to Canggu!! Especially if you are a surfer or looking to learn surfing! The waves here are cray and super pretty!
Loulou48,13 contributions,Sep 2019,Great surf spot if you are learning.No hawkers on the beach and a good beach to do a walk..quiet busy 
Minzzz,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,The up and coming destination with niche cafes and retail outlet but more laid back than the overly crowded Seminyak with a black beach to lure the beach goer! With good assortment of good class hotel accommodations and villas! 
adriana m,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Jul 2019,We arrived there around 5pm and strolled along the dark sand just enjoying seeing the crowd in the bars along the beach. Many bars set lounges on the beach for customers to relax and enjoy the sunset
James D,128 contributions,Oct 2019,"Quite enjoyed the quieter parts away from the main bars. Surfs cool. Too many people getting caught in rips. Lifeguards just wait for surfers to go pick them up. A Russian group daily doing a fake shark attack taking a bottle of red dye into the water and releasing it flailing etc. Whilst friends film it, including a drone. Apparently this is funny in Russia. They were told frequently that it wasn‚Äôt. Quite horrifying the first time I saw it. Go for a walk north if you want some peace. You‚Äôll not find much in regards to bars. But that‚Äôs not a bad thing. Having stayed in Seminyak and Canggu 2 years ago. I‚Äôd go to the quieter areas north of Seminyak but south of Canggu for a more relaxed cool vibe "
allicat527,"Watauga, TX",Sep 2019,"This beach looked great for surfing! We were only there for a short time, so we didn't get a chance to experience it 1st hand, but there were plenty of good waves and a lot of locals surfing."
dogmakes3,"New York City, NY",Aug 2019,"It‚Äôs clear that this was once a beautiful place to visit as Bali culture is beautiful but unfortunately it‚Äôs been overrun with Starbucks, drunk tourists, and westerners with no respect.  The locals are still friendly but if you travel all the way to Bali but need to have everything convenience of western life, do everyone a favor and stay home. "
Louise P,"Cabarita Beach, Australia",Sep 2019,After having stayed in Seminyak for most of our 10 Day stay in Bali you can definitely see a contrast in Canggu. Firstly the streets aren‚Äôt as ‚Äòclean‚Äô as Seminyak as far as Bali standards go. I can see why the younger crowd gravitate here for budget conscious options. Black sand beach with plenty of choice for beachside activities.Great surf. Can sit on the beach for sunset and drink Bintang üëçüèºüòé
Murray H,409 contributions,Sep 2019,"Lots of lounge chairs to hire with shade, or plenty of space on the black beach sand. Big car park small fee on left side end of street. Plenty of small shops for food, drinks, bathers, sunglasses if needed. Lots of surf schools if you're a beginner, everybody very helpful, friendly locals."
Granules2013,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2019,Came to the beach of an evening with friends to have a few drinks and watch the sunset. Pretty popular spot with loads of people with the same idea. There‚Äôs heaps of places to find a spot and get a drink thought so it wasn‚Äôt too overcrowded.
Erin F,"Wanaka, New Zealand",Apr 2019,Really cool place and vibe. Lots of fun places to sit and eat. Lots of places to lounge in the sun and a good surf beach too.
Nadja M,"Molnlycke, Sweden",Sep 2019,A beautiful beach with a great vibe. However the sand is quite dark and rough (just so you know what to expect) and there are rocks in the water so not the best beach for beginner surfers. 
Barry Sloan,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,"The beaches on the other side of the island are much better. The black sand is not very appealing. However it is a good beach if you want to learn how to surf. Plenty of surfboards available to rent, big car park so easy access "
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2019,"Almost impossible to swim here, high waves and black sand. Wasn‚Äôt tempting at all unfortunately. We ended up going to a beach club. "
Tracy D,"Gordon, Australia",Sep 2019,"The surf was so huge & messy most of the time, swimmers would just try to get wet & get out, so they didn't get pulled under by the rips.You have to be fit to surf- the waves can be strong & dumpy. More for short boards than Malibus.It was very enjoyable to sit up in the little surf shacks with a drink & watch the local surf competition - they knew what they were doing!"
Karen P,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019,We stayed outside Canggu so only came to the beach a couple of times.  Very large and super busy but excellent for surfing and large area of sand and good access into the sea.  We hired two loungers and a brolly.Good way to pass half a day chilling
INK,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"If you want to enjoy the sunset and get nice picts surrounding with the rocks, try to choose a day with super low tide and you've got AMAZING view!"
Sebastien B,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"If you are surfing, then Canggu Beach is one of the spots you have to go to. Otherwise, it has no specific interest. The beach can get a bit dirty. One of the issues being the dogs that are wandering and using the beach as their toilets,"

Debbydoodardar,"Burnie, Australia",Aug 2019,We have been coming to Bali for 25 years and had stayed at Berawa side of Canggu before and loved it there so we booked a lovely bed and breakfast at Echo Beach - big mistake - the accomodation was sensational and we can‚Äôt thank them enough for their assistance as we needed to leave Canggu early. Canggu is for young party and beach goers and is NOT for seniors like us at all.  I have never felt so out of place in my life.We walked to the beach through the Echo Beach dirt carpark to be greeted by piles of stinking garbage baking in the sun and a crowded black sand beach full of the young trendies - so not our scene.We stayed 1 night and put up with thumping music being carried in the breeze until early hours of the morning and then headed back to South Kuta where it is a slower pace and where we feel at home.I am posting this review just to let others in the same age group (60 plus - and we are very young at heart) that it‚Äôs for young people here at Canggu - party party üéâ 
Amalia S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Not that easy to find a good spotfor use to lay down ourselves in that beach. We have to walk along the end tip to nearly the other tip, nearly reach the finns beach club. Nice place to enjoy with your partner; sun bathing, perhaps not swimming because it's too dangerous! Long walk is the best place to try..."
Jonnytwosocks,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"Again- not impressed.  The place is over crowded, riddled with silly scooters, and has a rocky and dirty sandy beach. The little beach front restaurants are pretty decent but not worthy of more than a 3... Bintan is far better! So is Dubai!"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Aug 2019,"Always teaming with life every morning , some good. Waves on offer here and can get quite busy.Noticed many individual groups cleaning different parts of the beach each morning too."
philipbZ8524BX,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"the Canggu beach is a very trendy beach, virtually no hassle from hawkers. It has a modern vibe and has lovely cafe style eats and bars. very relaxed and hassle free."
Charmaine Forbes,4 contributions,Jul 2019,Canggu beach is away from the hustle and bustle of the bugger cities in Bali. We went there for a week of rest and relaxation and thus spot delight goods. Not once were we accosted by T-shirt sellers. On a number of occasions we went to the Lawn resort and the food was exquisite.
Pioneer826629,"Madrid, Spain",Jul 2019,"Along Canggu Beach you can find great bars, places to do surf and it is not as crowded as in seminyak."
Natalie P,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019,I have always stayed in Legian this time I decided to try different place .. and I love it canguu is so good I will definitely be staying here from now on
Tats S,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,Black sand and dog poo - entertainment plus!! watching people walking along the beach and in the surf being wiped out by large waves. 
chicagochica801,"Chicago, IL",Jun 2019,"The beach is gorgeous.  But there are a ton of stray dogs.  They mostly leave people alone, but it is hard to see.  There are hundreds of surfers.  The restaurants along the beach are great.  Some have music, food and drinks are cheap.  "
emma,World,Jul 2019,"Big waves and black sand, not the cleanest though. More ideal for surfers not swimmers or kids. People are all chilled here enjoying their time."
cl41r3,"Nottingham, UK",May 2019,"Spent a couple of hours relaxing aT Canggu beach. Great little cafes and places to eat, lovely long beach which was super busy with surf schools. So if you fancy surf lessons or catching a few rays whilst watching the surfers. This is a great beach to head to. "
kathy c,"Perth, Australia",May 2019,"We had never been to Canggu previously and took this opportunity as we were staying at nearby Seminyak. the first thing noticed in the journey is the conditions of the road is lesser than Kuta and Seminyak, it is slower and packed, but when you arrive at the beach that is forgotten. It is more a young persons location as the surf is much better than Jimbarin, Kuta and Seminyak the shops are in the proximity of the beach are upmarket and there are very good eating places. they still have their markets and pop ups, but they are a couple of Ks away. No shortage of Accommodation and if you are for a good board surf then this is the location."
Inneke W,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"It‚Äôs a nice & cozy hotel. Hotel staffs are helpful. There was a day that my room was cleaned twice. Staffs take off their shoes during  cleaning process. I was disappointed when it comes to pillow. Pillows were dirty full of brown spot, I was asking for clean pillows but still get the pillow with brown spot. It would be better if hotel has spare clean pillow to replace the dirty ones. "
NicoleReimer,"Munich, Germany",Jun 2019,"We love Canggu, loved it 5 years ago and still enjoy the place. It offers everything in a short distance, eg. restaurants (every price range), Spas, laundry‚Äôs It is busier and more crowded but you still can find relaxing places. The shops are more like boutiques which is different to former times and there are a lot of new international restaurants like pizza, mexican or greece food.Luckily there are still enough ‚Äûwarungs‚Äú providing the delicious Balinese food."
kimgirbin,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"I came to work at the dojo, and canggu beach was my happy place to do morning and night walks. Makes me want to learn how to surf, next time for sure "
Bernhard B,"Linz, Austria",Jun 2019,"We stayed in Bali for 3 weeks and we always booked Agung. He ist absolutely trustworthy, always on time and has reasonable prices. We can absolutely recommend Agung. His number is  +62 812-3801-4543 You find him on WhatsApp."
JosefaWong,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2019,The beach is very good for surfing but not swimming. There are so many nice and friendly coaches available here.  My son‚Äôs coach Yudy taught him so well. He improved his surfing so much after 3 lessons. 
Suzee,7 contributions,Jun 2019,We did a day trip to Canggu Beach & loved it BUT walking to buy lunch we saw a great rate at a money exchange booth on the roadside (big mistake)..  3 men were running it & after I counted the money twice & placed it on the counter while they asked if we had small change.... Obviously while we were looking in our bags the guy behind the counter took a heap of money from the pile I had counted without us seeing!! When we got home we counted & were missing a lot of the money!  We were back in Ubud & no receipt either which wouldn't have mattered anyway!    Our day was ruined & our trust totally gone!     We warn others in the area... It was just a wooden makeshift 'office'on the side of the road... Be careful!     Not far from the beach.. LHS  heading away from the beach
Yoanna S,20 contributions,Jun 2019,"If you're looking for a nice and less crowded beach, you should come here. It's a good place to escape from the busy big cities.One more good thing I found is the food. I especially love the local food. Very tasty!"
robton,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2019,"Having travelled to Bali many times over the last 25 years, we never considered going to stay in Canggu, up and till now. Big mistake !!!! Should have stayed with the devil we already knew, however that not being the case we paid the price. What an absolute nightmare Canggu turned out to be. Certainly not the quiet and sleepy Bali we've come to know over the years. Having rented a fairly expensive villa for 12 days, we encountered nothing more but loud music ( till 3am every morning ) and the roaring motorbikes up to all hours of the night, the screaming and often drunken nightclub revellers making their way back to their backpackers facilities after the nightclubs closed, and so on and so on. Admittedly, our villa was very close to the beach front near the end of the main road, so villa's situated further away from the beach might be more quiet, so be aware where you book your accommodation. If you are young and love surfing and do the clubs this place is for you, but those seeking a holiday without loud music and nightlife then stay away. We certainly will never be back to Canggu, never !!"
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2019,This is predominantly a surfing beach which has volcanic grey sand and often has rubbish along the sand and in the water so we don't swim here. 
ozzztraveler,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Good for walking along, and surfing but not swimming due to strong rips.A few local night bars have opened up along the beach next to Fins beach club."
LUX ESCAPES üåè üì∏,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019,"If your coming here to sunbathe and chill if give it a miss , it's volcanic black sand will get everywhere and can ruin your clothes. There is much better beaches to sit and swim at in Bali. If your going for a walk it's great or just to watch the sunset it's ideal. But white sandy beach with crystal blue water it's not."
mikkel,"Canggu, Indonesia",Jun 2019,Not so impressive but its quite fun to be here. And the location is not very far from my place. Bring your dog and have fun at sunset
tinna,"Canggu, Indonesia",May 2019,"Not very recommended just a standart place, not very beautiful.  I would recommend to go there at sunset"
Joni,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2018,You know this beach isn't so special but it's very fun place to catch the sunset. See it thru yourself
orientdesign,wateringen,May 2019,Canggu is hot at the moment and also for the future. A cozy location on the beach with beautiful sea with many and high waves. A great place for the active surfers.There are also many small restaurants and bars in the area.
hollyjames8000,"Perth, Australia",May 2019,Tropical delight to watch the sun go down and learn to surf. Cheap beach bars or get away from the crowd with a little walk . 
Jodie784,"Chelsea, Australia",May 2019,"A must see beach, the sand and water is clearer here and the temperature of the water is perfect after a hot and busy day. There are a load of casual cafes/shacks serving food and drinks. I had my reservations about them, but the food was surprisingly good. The water is rough, so I would recommend only confident swimmers go in. There is some surfing too. The sunset is amazing. Try to fit it in"
SRD1994,"Swansea, UK",Apr 2019,"Brown sand and very rough sea, strong current can't swim. Perfect and amazing surf - full of surfers. Very cheap sunbeds and drinks, no wifi."
Aurora Ribka M,Indonesia,Apr 2019,"My husband and I came here just to enjoy the evening. This beach is crowded with tourists, but not as busy as Seminyak. Beach chairs can be occupied, but we recommend ordering food or drinks. After the sun began to sink into the night, the beach was deserted and food vendors began to close their outlets. We better prepare the pedestal to sit on the beach to anticipate the lack of seating. Food prices are quite affordable. I ordered a coconut for IDR 25,000 and a juice mix for IDR 20,000. Far different in price if we order menu in Seminyak beach."
mg378,Kuala Lumpur,Jul 2018,"Canggu is the new seminyak! Seminyak has become a little more hustle and bustle latelyCanggu has got it's very millennial feel to it with a young 18-late 20's age group, digital nomads and plenty of al fresco barsFun spots around Canggu would be Finn's and The Lawn for a good mix crowd and great ambience"
Arijit B,"Asansol, India",May 2019,My wife and I visited the beach twice and both the times were disappointed due to the dirt and filth. The beach has dark sand and is seldom( or never) cleaned.There are some shacks and cafes on the beach for sunset views but their food is not worth the risk.A better alternative is the Seminyak beach which is cleaned daily. 
LauraHu22x,24 contributions,May 2019,"If you like to surf this beach is great, good waves and plenty of places to rent boards and get lessons if needed. It's not somewhere to spend the day on a nice beach however, the sand is dirty and rough. The sea is fun to swim in if you like to play in the waves but not have a relaxing time in as it's too rough. "
Elizabeth C,"Seseh, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Great surfing beach but not well suited to children or sun bathing as dramatic waves and rocky foreshore.  Good for wave and surf watching.Cluster of small bars at one end and bbq restaurants at the other.  
Matt_Schulze,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2018,"Stayed in Canggu over Christmas 2018, and went surfing on Boxing Day. Definitely some big swells here considering how close to the beach the waves hit. If a beginner it‚Äôs probably easier to learn in Bingin which is fairly close. The benefit of surfing here is that the break is on the beach and not a reef, but just be warned the waves can come in thick and fast so prepare if you stack it to keep copping the waves!The beach itself is pretty good, a lot of rubbish much like Kuta but overall great for a stroll down towards Echo beach. The sunsets here are amazing and great to take in over drinks at Finns Beach Club!"
TheOExpressüè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å∑Û†Å¨Û†Å≥Û†Åøüá≠üá∞,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2019,"There was a pretty good atmosphere at sunset here but the sand is very dark and coarse, and there looked to be a fair amount of rubbish too. Still, that‚Äôs more of a Bali-wide problem than just specific to this beach I suppose."
Agung,4 contributions,Apr 2019,The place is nice yet the cleanliness is something that need to be look after to. Relaxing place to be for family
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"Canggu is a relatively new 'beach resort' and few lessons seem to have been learned from Kuta, Legian, Seminyak and Sanur tourist hot spots. No efficient public transportation system, garbage collection and sewers very problematic, no planning resulting in shops, restaurants and other buisnesses popping up everywhere, especially near the beaches and along the -already very busy- roads. I cycled to Canggu several times from relatively laid-back Sanur right through busy Denpasar. Not really recommended. Most Western tourists rent motorbikes and many stay in hostels. Cheap 16-bed dorms are available. Some make an effort to learn how to surf, which is good, though wave ethics are often not included in the training. Compared to the other side of the Southern Bali peninsula the waves in Canggu are great, but they also bring a lot of dirt to the beach. If you are more into swimming, cleanliness and quietness Sanur is a better place."
Alvilde P,World,Apr 2019,"To much garbage on the beach. It is not nice being on the beach with all this garbage. Otherwise the beach is nice, good for surfing. "
VikSen2223,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,"We visited Canggu (awesome place) for the first time in Oct 2018. Decided to check out the beach as it was walking distance from our Villa. It might be great for Surfing but it is NOT FOR KIDS!  We had 2 toddlers age 3 and 4 with us. The beach sand is black (tiny, tiny rocks that shine in the sun like gems, very pretty but heats up so much you can't really walk on it! it's that hot! Also sticks everywhere and gets in your cloths (our kids rashies still got some of the sand stuck inside the fabric even after weekly washing for a year!) The waves are way to rough! Our house keep told us scary stories how some tourists have lost their toddlers to the sea! I can imagine that as it would take seconds! so i you do visit keep alert!    I must say there was no rubbish on the beach itself! There were some guys you could rent a sun bed from (bargain with them!) also a guy who sold some cold water and  Bintang beer :)   No life guards!"
Ryan Mazure,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2019,"Canggu beach is one of the more popular surfing beaches in Bali. If you want to surf where surfer ettiquite doesn't exist this is the place. Be prepared for people dropping in, crashing and wiping out all over other people. Be sure to wear a helmet if you want to avoid any nasty board collisions "
Chapre29,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Mar 2019,"Good things are that there are a lot of activities to do; surfing, beach clubs, bars, town etc. Beach is not too crowded. What we didt like is there is plastic everywhere and evere day new stacks of plastic... sad for such a nice beach."
HolidayByDesign,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Mar 2019,"This is a really nice beach. Black sand, and some large rocks which have been eroded by the waters, making for an interesting seascape.Restaurants and bars are along the beach front, as you'd expect. "
ron_trenning,Heiloo,Mar 2019,"M√∏re relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak,very nice restaurants most with a view of the ocean.The sunsets are our of This world"
Thomas,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2019,"Usually this place gets a bit to crowded for my taste but if you go out a little further from the main beach area, you can find chiller spots. There are plenty places to grab a drink and some food around aswell so a lot to enjoy. "
Kasia Z,"Central Poland, Poland",Mar 2019,"Beautiful spot, great for surfers üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è , drink with the Indian Ocean view or simply for a stroll. Photographers will appreciate beautiful sunsets."
Sunnygirl27,"Caloundra, Australia",Mar 2019,"I have been visiting Bali for 24 years and Canggu is my favourite. Much quieter than Seminyak & Legian. There is a little rubbish in the surf but from sunrise to well after sunset this beach has everything you could want from beach bars, good swell, happy locals and toasted tourists loving life."
LDG,"Secret Harbour, Australia",Mar 2019,"Definitely not the best looking beach , a black looking sand , with rubbish through it , possibly black caused by the volcano ?. Water doesn‚Äôt look inviting like other parts of Bali. Had a few waves , hence what must be the big ticket item maybe here .Few bars along the beach , but doesn‚Äôt compare to Seminyak.Possibly won‚Äôt visit again . "
Samantha De Castro,"Makati, Philippines",Mar 2019,"Nice place to stay if you wanna watch the sunset, people go here to surf too. We stayed at a beach front restaurant so we could watch the sunset without the hassle of where to stay.One downside is going and leaving here. There is a local conflict between Grab/GoJek/BlueBird and local taxis here. It is kinda traumatizing since we already booked a grab, and we were already inside the car when a guy in a motorcycle followed us and forced us to go down. Apparently, grab is not allowed in that area. It was scary since it‚Äôs in the middle of the night, we were forced to walk to our hotel, and the streets are already dark. No cars/scooters were passing. The guy in a motorcycle was harassing the grab and kept shouting (we dont know the language coz they spoke indonesian).We are tourists so we dont know where to get a taxi (since there are no taxi around) so Grab is the most convenient way, yet somehow, some of the locals cant understand that. Also, if you choose the option to ride them, it is freaking expensive compared to taxi and grab considering the distance is only 1-2km away. They will charge you for as much as 150k. None of us also know how to drive a scooter so we cant rent one (most of the tourist here rent a scooter to go to places since it‚Äôs a lot cheaper, cars could be really expensive here)To the local government of Bali, please fix this. We were two girls traveling that time so imagine how scared we were."
Travelgram,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,"Even though we were staying at a luxury hotel with a great beach, we went to Canggu beach for surf lessons. The beach has all you need with beds and umbrellas for hire at cheap rates, drinks you can buy and also about 10 cafe/bars right next to the beach. The beach is clean and also has a great view for sunset."
apinchofhaze,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2019,It is a great location to watch the sunset. It is also good for first-time surfers trying to just get comfortable with their board.
ducati748af,"Paris, France",Feb 2019,"This is probably the dirtiest beach I've ever been too. So much rubbish on the beach and in the water. Having said that though in my week here I have seen a lot of clean up teams trying to tidy this filth up, that's good to see. But I do have to mention all the stray dogs on the beach that are intimidating. They are not aggressive yet but I won't be long. Makes it difficult to enjoy your morning runs."
JordanMcfal,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2019,Best place to have a drink and watch the sun go down over the horizon. Many a Instagram picture have been taken here.
Darrin D,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,"If you have visited Bali and not been to Canggu then you are kidding yourself. You must visit Canggu. It's laid back, its chilled and the sunsets match anything at Seminyak. The surfers are fun to watch and people visiting here seem to be reasonably chilled. Yes - I must admit that's before about 9pm - might be different late at night but we were early to bed. Great place to visit."
natstravel10,"Mt Martha, Australia",Jun 2018,"Seen many beaches around the world and cannot really understand why this seems to be popular. The amount of debris that has washed ashore and lack of softer sand which beach goers were happy to lay around in was astounding. The surf was okay but you needed to contend with the other 60 people out on boards, a mixture of novice and the more experienced. Alot of rubbish within the area also from the public which was a shame. Awkward to get to and with Bali traffic can take a while. We opted to walk back along the beach to Legian which took 1.15. Easy walk and good to see different venues along the way.  "
Jf_Ruth,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2019,"One thing about Canggu Beach that‚Äôs worth the visit is the beautiful sunset. The wave is nice  too, great for surfing. But the beach is not very clean, a lot of rubbish, plastics bottles everywhere... "
Onedaytraveller,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,My honest review about all the beach in bali regarding the sunset is along the canggu area! You could get a very whole super big round sunset! With a nice colour and the sound of sea breeze and a view of many surfers finish their activity and bring the board. Oh my god! Canggu sunset you stole my heart.
Ruth S,3 contributions,Feb 2019,I really wonder how people can think this beach is nice. Walking along the beach is like walking through a pile of rubbish. Just disgusting.
Mark D,"Newcastle, Australia",Feb 2019,"Canggu is a great area, quieter and more relaxed than the hustle and bustle of Kuta or Legian, however whilst the beach offers some great waves for surfing and wind surfing its not great if you just want a swim. Worth a visit!"
CapeTurning,"Iisalmi, Finland",Dec 2018,"Spent here 6 days during Xmas. (if you want to read more on my discoveries on Bali beaches, read my reviews about Sanur and Seminyak beaches, I refer here also to those texts)The devastating plastic explosion here was a shock. And, no comfort did we receive which was the case in Semiyak, from armies of cleaners and comforting words: this is only few days.The Beaches kilometres long full of plastic, and NO ONE cleaning them. The beach shag keepers just waited and let the sea come and take it back.Here the locals don't even say it to last only a few days, but even months, the rainy season. And they directly say it is balinese own fault: the trash comes from rivers, and the rainy seasons lift the rivers to flooding, which empties the carbage into ocean.Ugly, awful.  Update on day 4: Around the Finns Beach Club we found some 300m long streak of beach, which was clean. Maybe the currents had spared this, and would imagine that here they do clean. Update on the last day: Ok, the Canggu beach consist of many shorter strips, my comments concern the area between the Pantai Kayu Putih and Pantai Batu Bolong beaches (according to google maps)."
Adrian B,"Aldinga Beach, Australia",Feb 2019,Have stayed previously in a villa ten minutes out. This time near Echo Beach. The vibe of young people from all over the world is so pleasant after the dynamics of Kuta and Legian
kyliebrown1,"Soldotna, AK",Feb 2019,canggu beach is much better than seminayk. but there is trash from time to time. but more clean. lots of surfers so it‚Äôs fun to watch them do their thing. black sand beach which we‚Äôve never seen before. recommend canggu over seminayk beach 100% 
JGSingers,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2019,"I love waves, ocean, sea air, salt water.... But when I visited this beach was a festering pit of rubbish and plastic and river debris (including everything you could think of). Washed up on the sand, creek beds and circling around in the water. Did I swim? NO WAY. NOT ON YOUR LIFE. Hepatitis just waiting to happen....GROSS"
Omar H Ali,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jan 2019,The beach is vibrant and cool with a good mix of crowd. Food and beverage options are great . All together great place to chill hand relax with a nice sunset view .
Ray,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2019,I do not like this beach to chill because is full of tourist and rubbish as well I just go there when I want to surf because I am not a champion.
Young-ish couple,28 contributions,Jan 2019,"This beach is amazing for surfers but not so great for non surfers. The local area is also quite cool as surfers are quite cool I supposeThe beach is nice but the waves are very strong, also there are is a lot of debris like large tree branches on the shore line being moved up and down by the wavesBeds are 50,000rp each and surf boards are 50,000rp for 2 hours. There are also loads of instructors if you want to learn to surfIf you want a nice peaceful beach steer clear of this one, however, this is a surfers paradise "
Raj0608,"Pune, India",Dec 2018,"If one loves surfing, this is the place to be. You can laze around on the white sand beach or can sleep on the decks on the beach and enjoy some mocktails or juices and can also read a book. A must visit"
spensterr,"Fort Collins, CO",Jan 2019,Canggu is a super popular surf beach. Some of the best breaks on the west side of the island...also great spot to catch a sunset and just enjoy watching the surfers tear it up. Beach does get a little tight once it's high tide and it is has gotten more and more dirty with litter since our last visit to Bali :( 
cterrantroy,"Chatswood, Australia",Jan 2019,"We went to Seminyak for the first time in 5 years on this trip and won't be back. The traffic and the people, it's busier than Kuta. Canggu on the other hand is brilliant, it's chilled, you can walk across the road without risking death, the beaches aren't covered in rubbish, you get the same great sunset, and there is heaps of good restaurants and accommodation. "
Surfingfamilyadventures,Michigan,Jan 2019,"I have no clue why anyone would ever go here.  We booked 11 days in Nusa Dua and then 11 days in Echo beach.  We left the next morning after arriving.  I have never seen a beach with more garbage and water that was so dirty.  The surf was nothing great either.  I have traveled around the world surfing and never seen more garbage on a beach.  I would not even go in the water.  Nicaragua and Costa Rica, California, Florida , Mexico all have cleaner nicer beaches.   We have three young children and this place is not kid friendly.  The kids have travelled to many third world countries and they even said this city is full of garbage.  The town of echo beach is full of trash.  Do not go here "
Margaret.Robinson,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2018,"We were staying at jimbaran and we caugth a taxi to Canggu as we had been told from locals to go there.We paid 200k rupias (one way) and we spend almost 2 hours to arrive there due of the traffic.It absolutely didn't worth it!The black sand beach is small, crowded, and everything is overpriced. Kids could not swim because of the big waves.Went to an italian restaurant for lunch and it was just average and they only serves salad as a gluten free option (my husband is celiac)The worst thing happened when we tried to catch a taxi to back to our hotel. Local drivers are very rude and after a long bargain with a few drivers, we paid 450k rupias for the same trip that we paid only 200k in the morning!We only throw a day of our holiday...Definetely not a place to go!"
Eanna57,460 contributions,Dec 2018,Big beach with large waves and black sand. Not great for swimming but ideal for surfers. Do not were good shoes while walking on the beach!! Black sand sticks to and stains and I destroyed a very good pair so lesson learned. Many good bars and eateries to choose from but the beach is disappointing not least for the amount of rubbish that  accumulates and is left lying there without collection.
THOMAS V,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"It has good view, it is a good place to spend the evening with your loved one. It's near the Aston Cungg Beach hotel."
Lee G,"Santorini, Greece",Dec 2018,"Cruising to the beach with a lady hanging on for dear life and your cocoNUTS  in the other hand AND CANggu beach with a  fantastic sunset dead ahead, nirvana is On the horizon! U can‚Äôt miss here my friends!"
Lily F,"Cygnet, Australia",Dec 2018,"The Canguu beach area is lovely with lots of surfers and friendly tourists/expats around, and the food/restaurant quality is great! So many areas to sit and eat and drink and watch the pretty sunset at about 630pm. The beach itself however is good if your a surfer but not fantastic for a peaceful swim. The ocean is very wavy with even the shallow waves packing quite a hit and it can be dangerous with strong tides. Wouldn‚Äôt recommend taking young children here. Beach can be a bit smelly sometimes too with small river channels coming into the beach along it."
sermar99,"Oakland Park, FL",Nov 2018,"Some times you find some garbage around and you have to cross some little creeks in your way, but it is worth it."
Nadine S,Germany,Nov 2018,Its my first beach i saw at bali. For me its avarage in comparison of Malaysia or Thailand... but i seems to be perfect to learn how to surf. 
Vicky,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Oct 2018,"Was here surfing over the weekend. This beach is clean, have a lot of restaurants nearby and a good view of the kuta."
Nikolaos G,2 contributions,Nov 2018,First time I experienced something like this .The waves are great and surfers look so cool but the Canggu beach is so disgusting.Full of plastic and dirt all over.I am surprised how people like to surf or lay down on this environmental crime.Possitive that I noticed some locals in green uniform try to clean the beach.So bad for Bali and Canggu
paragbpatel,"Vadodara, India",Nov 2018,very quite beach with lovely waves. clean beach with very good properties close by. had lovely time. 
Jordanne,"Dromore, UK",Nov 2018,Beach is clean to a certain extent--no rubbish lying around but dogs are free to wander about which means dog poop which is disgusting. We seen many dogs do this and their owners did not pick it up so always very careful were to walk.The beach has people selling water etc and cafes nearby for food. No toilet facilities. No hose to wash water from your feet. It is a lovely place to watch the sunset and a lot of surfers on the water
Jennifer G,43 contributions,Oct 2018,Canggu the hidden treasure- a fantastic location our 5th visit to Bali and Canggu is our new destination place. Hire a scooter from Big Bike to explore the many cafes- beach clubs- shops and beaches on offer. Experince all the culture of a beach location with the rural landscape. Close location to the hussle & bussle of Kuta and Seminyak on scooter ort by taxi. Relax and enjoy in Canggu
melanieben,48 contributions,Nov 2018,"I absolutely loved watching the surfers on Canggu beach. I walked quite a way along, past Finns blaring noise, found a sunbed and parasol for 50k, a few beers from one of the local guys and a good book set me up for the day. "
toon3466,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"If your staying in Canggu it‚Äôs not a bad spot, a fair trip from other tourist centres and old style Bali with open drains and rough roads. Beach is small but the outlook with the volcanic rock breaks and  volcanic sand beach is something different. Lots of new private places being built with rice paddies and cows next door. "
Annalina,"Varberg, Sweden",Oct 2018,Nice beach with big waves. Plenty of places to rent a surfboard. 2h surflesson costs 350 000 rupiah. 
Havingamare,"Leyton, UK",Oct 2018,"We thoroughly enjoyed our visits to Canggu Beach. There are cool local shops, bars, restaurants and cafes. The beach is wide, not overly busy and great for surfing. A really great place to hang out for a day and into the evening and watch the sunset. Our only complaint about Canggu and the other busy tourist areas in this part of Bali is the  ‚Äútaxi mafia‚Äù. We were followed all the way down the very long main road when I said I wouldn‚Äôt pay for the massively overpriced ‚Äúlocal taxis‚Äù fees. A scooter literally followed us and threw us out of the Bluebird taxi that stopped for us! Simply because they expect tourists to pay more than locals and get quite aggressive when you don‚Äôt. Despite being a really great town and resort I would‚Äôve go back for that reason alone. These thugs attitude marred what was otherwise a great two weeks in Bali. The people are generally really lovely which is why this aggressive behaviour came as such a surprise. The police or local businesses should really do something about this abuse of tourists. I expect to pay extra for things in these areas, but I don‚Äôt expect to be hassled if I chose not too!"
ndags,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2018,"Nothing fancy on the beach but great place to watch plenty of people surfing and enjoying the water. Great place to view is at the end of Jalan Pantai Batu to the right, a series of little bars/restaurants."
lashasingapore,3 contributions,Oct 2018,"Sand is a little dark, beach slightly unkempt - not a 5 star resort private beach.BUT, shaded beach loungers for rent at IDR 50,000 each, fresh coconut and beer, great eateries all around Canggu (Sandbar, anyone?), public shower (3k) and toilets 92k) right off the beach and fantastic large waves to frolic in, great sand for kids to make sand castles - what's not to love?Canggu is a 20-25min taxi ride from Seminyak (40k IDR)"
NYCTraveler68,"New York City, NY",Sep 2018,"Great for surfing but not the most beautiful beach at all. The whole beach area is a bit unkempt, rough, and not very attractive. It's a great place to surf from what I can tell but not really for lounging around. It's not like the beaches of Riviera Maya, Cancun, Phuket, or the Caribbean. The small town itself was more fun and interesting but don't go here for the beach. "
Bernard William Pr√¶torivs,"Randfontein, South Africa",Oct 2018,"Best place to watch the sun set in Bali. Cocktails available, make sure you are at the beach before 3 in the afternoon."
giarcrendrag,15 contributions,Sep 2018,"Canggu is now hipster central with huge array of eating and drinking options - forget the overcrowded shopping areas, get to Canggu"
dietwee,"Antwerp, Belgium",Sep 2018,"use to be a cool place with relax people, now it's evolving to a hipster place with loud bikes and hollow ego people "
Jan vdw,"Vlijmen, The Netherlands",Oct 2018,"Black beach. Strong waves, easy and relaxt swimming not possible. Beautiful sunset and cheap diner on beach possible. Nice music. 13/10 would go again. "
Cintia S,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Nov 2017,"This is a very nice beach if you dont expect white sand and picture perfect pal trees. If you like caribbean beaches than Bali is probably not for you. With that said, Canggu beach is an awesome place with lots of water sports, beach clubs and a cool crowd. "
charmanemajor,"Tennant Creek, Australia",Sep 2018,If you love to surf this is an amazing beach for you! Every shop walking down the beach has surf boards to rent and a lot of shops offer surfing lessons for a decent price too!  A very chilled relaxed clean beach! Nice to spend a day here chilling out and surfing! 
Hamish07,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2018,"The view here at some of the beach bars is magnificent.  Lots of good surfing going down, the sun setting and all the beautiful people chilling out with cocktails."
KapitiKiwis,"Raumati Beach, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"Grey sand, turbulent  seas, no shells, lots of surfers. Enjoyed watching the surfers, there are many warung with lounges and bean bags"
Leon S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2018,This is an awesome beach. Visited it many times for a young coconut at sunset and for a surf during the day. All of the places to eat and drink are nice and cheap. Its a must visit for sure.
mitchmad1,"Davistown, Australia",Sep 2018,Canggu and echo beach at sunset with a soft chair and a beer at anyone of the beach bars is a must to escape the madness in Kuta 
lourdesalea,"Miami, FL",Sep 2018,"Loved visiting Bali back in 2014! We stayed in Canggu beach, close to the area of Seminyak. Learned to surf and everyone was so nice. Can‚Äôt wait to return! "
nikaus21,"Newcastle, Australia",Sep 2018,"We hired a driver for day trip to Echo beach from Kuta. Warning!! Traffic is very bad!! took an hour to get there. beach was lovely, sat on beach and didn't get hassled. "
Ren1211,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2018,"If you want to surf while in Bali, this is the beach to come to. Also a great spot to hang out and lounge in the sun and enjoy the gentle breeze through the heat. Nice views of other parts of Bali in the distance as well."
A_Shifayet,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Aug 2018,"We had visited this place in the last week of Aug-2018. This beach could be recognized as surfing heaven for the surfers. Across the beach there are some nice beach club, where you can enjoy the sunset with a small piece of drink to great dinner."
pizzaguy_88,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Sep 2018,I visited while passing through Canggu and walked along the shoreline and the sand is a little less refined but the beach is nice for surfing. Plenty of restaurants around 
Simon B,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Sep 2018,"Really cool vibe but mix of all ages around. Surfers from my local area (Bells Beach Oz) commonly say about Bali trip ‚Äúgo to Canggu‚Äù. The tourist attitude and town feel reminds me of Byron Bay. Yet black sand beach and awesome viewing platforms (Old Man‚Äôs & Echo Beach Club) make the whole environment pretty special in its own Balinese way. Why didn‚Äôt I try a gap year here ... oh dear, 25 years ago?"
Peteski2016,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Aug 2018,This is a very cool part of Bali just north of Seminyak and it is becoming famous for surfing with its black volcanic sand and it has cool shops and restaurants. Finns and La Laguna are some of the big name restaurants here. Loved it. Great shops.
Yvonne L,"Teriang, Malaysia",Jun 2018,place where you can chill for the whole day. there are quite a lot of bars and restaurant along the beach which worth to try of. 
Familybliss,South Pacific,Jun 2018,"Canggu is awesome don‚Äôt miss this little cultural district when visiting Bali!They have heaps of shops, heaps of restaurants, heaps of massages, and lots of accommodation from $1000us a night to $5us a night!Sunsets are incredible too!Make sure you realise no grabs and no Uber‚Äôs for pick ups, drop offs ok!Enjoy the beautiful people and the cultural sigmoid this beautiful wee place!"
Malarchy,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo",Jul 2018,Canggu beach is a popular but unattractive stretch of sand on Bali's east coast just north of Seminyak beach.  It is black sand and not at all well-kept.  There are also far too many people for it to be all that pleasant.  Stray dogs are also a pest.The most popular stretch of beach is that in front of the various warungs and bars perched above.  Row after row of cheap beach loungers with parasols are full of people during peak season.  With all the people come rubbish which is not looked after really at all as much of the beach is a mess.The mess is made worse by dogs.  Stray and owned dogs are on the beach and their produce is a hazard that needs to be looked out for.The beach itself is black sand which can be ok but here is not fine enough to be a pleasant experience.  The waves in this part of the world are moderate but even when it did not seem that blustery it was still not possible to enter the water as warning signs were posted.  Even wading in a few yards was prohibited.Hawkers were present but were not overly persistent.  They did seem to spend too longer loitering but were not a threat.Seeing as there are much nicer spots just south in Seminyak it is not entirely clear why so many flock to Canggu beach or why it is considered to be a better spot.  This is an example of the worst of Bali's beaches.
Sam B,"Walsall, UK",Mar 2018,"Highly recommend üëåüèª - I‚Äôd suggest going to this beach around 6pm, grab a beer from OldMans, sit on the beach whilst listening to a local band play & watch the sunset üåÖ"
default230820183,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2018,"My favourite, the best place. The totally Uber cool place in Bali. Canggu has some of the best beach bars, like The Lawn and Finns were some of the places I visited. I had my most speechless sunset experience here. Not crowded the beaches here give you more time to be with nature and enjoy its beauty. The crowd on these beaches is very friendly and meeting new people here is very refreshing. If you heading to Bali and have decided on the south of Bali. Canggu should be considered as the places to stay and hangout. "
Tommaso M,"Capo d'Orlando, Italy",Aug 2018,That‚Äôs where you want to be in Bali. Avoid Kuta and all the other crowded over-fancy places. This is where you really feel the Island.Nice spot for surfing and to know people from all over the world.
Ajinkya,"Varca, India",Jul 2018,Canggu beach is only for professional surfers. Do not even think of going into the ocean even if you are mature swimmer. High tides are risky and no life guards on the beach. Temperature of water is too low so I did not go in water. Many restaurants on the beach. Grab your best sun bed and beer at low cost and enjoy the sunset and see surfers surfing on high tides. 
Rusky6,"Shepparton, Australia",Jul 2018,"Big surf (definitely not for beginners), black sand and great people watching. Definitely not the type of beach where you go for a leisurely dip as the ocean is pretty heavy along here. It's good watching all the people get dumped right on shore though (entertainment on it's own!!!!). Great spot to get a cheap cold beer and watch the sunset (beautiful). Cool vibes all along from Old Mans and the Lawn down to La Brisa at Echo Beach. You have to get some corn along the beach - it's cheap and delicious."
IzabellazMelbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"If you like to observe beautiful sunset , great big waves, sitting on the beach, drinking cocktails from small ‚Äú beach bars‚Äù  you can do it . Canggu Batu Bolong beach attracts surfers , travellers, musicians and many local dogs. Relax, sit down and observe. "
Captain_Sloth,21 contributions,Jul 2018,Great beach. Waves were too rough for my 2 year old niece but my 8 year old nephew had a great time. Plenty of cheap beach bars along the beach with bean bags to chill and watch life go by. Great place to spend your rest day in Canggu.
Mark C,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Canggu beach, black sand, giant waves, dangerous. I am from Australia so spoilt for beautiful beaches. Canggu beach is great for surfing but there are few swimming beaches. Luckily there are lots of beach clubs that overlook the beach. Hey Finns Echo Beach, La Biza,  and The Lawn. Beaches are clean. Alwats swim between the flags if you do go in."
Ani C,52 contributions,Jul 2018,yes yes yes. great surf.  great atmosphere.  casual laid back bali....but the developers are moving in. enjoy a taste of low key bali before it disappears as its now becoming trendy all to fast. 
bekwil,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Jul 2018,Great vibe in Canggu; it was a cool place to stay. Less busy on the streets than Seminyak. There was a fantastic variety of places to eat. I would stay here again but just a word of warning it‚Äôs not an easy place to learn to surf with a rocky bottom underneath the surf break. 
Chris P,"Caboolture, Australia",Jul 2018,"Our expectations of Canggu Beach were not to be disappointed. It‚Äôs kept fairly clean. The ocean is pretty clean apart from the creeks which would have pollutants coming out from inland.  There are many bars and places to eat as you walk around. A must is BBQ corn. There are very clean toilets opposite Old Mans Bar, you just have to pay 2k. "
geekmomtokyo,"Tokyo, Japan",Jul 2018,Beach is great for surfer but watch out if you have you children. My toddler drowned even at a knee deep area because of strong wave.Beach itself was not so clean. Lots of nice cafe. Young surfers would have great time here
azevedosofia83,Luxembourg,Jul 2018,"Canggu beach rhymes with good vibe.If you are a surf lover, this is a must. If you are not, enjoy the beach, the nice restaurants and the shopping area."
Jacqui‚Äôs Journeys üåè,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Murky water, some parts of the beach have rock so not perfect for swimming. Lots ofHomeless dogs around. Good music, plenty of food options and cheap bars around! Busy and lots going on. Come here to be in the Center of the action at the beach / bars. Would recommend simply swimming or relaxing at a different beach though.Great surf for beginners and intermediate! Board hire is only 50,000 IRD for 2 hours - cheap! Would recommend going out at dawn to avoid crowds - and high tide is best for beginners , low tide best for intermediate surfers (because of the rocks/ reef )"
SelineCR,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",Jul 2018,"What a great place , very nice vibe. The people are nice and chill. Very very good food options and a great beach. Watch out for some stones in the water.surfing is what it is about on this beach"
macrules,melbourne,May 2018,"After many trips to Bali this was our first time in Canggu and we loved it.  For me it had a Byron Bay feel to it but with a Bali twist. Fantastic, healthy, innovative food, gorgeous boutiques and bars, beautiful rice paddies nearby, yoga classes if that‚Äôs your thing and a very strong European mix of clientele. We stayed in Batu Balong and visited Berawa Beach and Echo Beach.  Batu Balong was the perfect choice for us as there was plenty to do and you could walk if you‚Äôre not inclined to ride a scooter .  We‚Äôre not surfers but it was fantastic to watch all the surfers out there everyday.  Great experience."
Brian P,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Jun 2018,"Canggu is more laid-back than Seminyak and Kuta and also being next to echo Beach is great for Surfers and the young set. A little far out from the hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta and if you want the 'cheap' shopping experience - then Canggu is not yet the place. The 'local' taxi service is quite exclusive and you pay up to double the rate for travel than if you were to get 'Blue Bird' cabs - which are 'locally excluded'. We were charged 150,000 IDR for a trip from Canggu to Seminyak but the 'Blue Bird' cab fare back was on the meter and only 70,000.If you don't need to go to Seminyak/Kuta and want a more relaxing holiday - then this area is a nice change and some great villa's here as well as cheap accommodation options for those happy with 'cheap'."
francois s,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2018,Love this beachFar from these australian beach club with loud music and so crowdedBali like we love
AWCostless,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2018,"Depending which side you're on: around the statue of the elephant lots of families, including locals, flying kites, sitting down and walking. Further to the left, lots of small bars and restaurants with seating on the beach, great for young people, good surfing. Further to the left still, larger restaurants, mainly bbq, good fresh food, nice all day around, but especially at sunset. The black sand sticks to the soles of your shoes!"
ClaireBare,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,Canggu Beach was nice. Long stretch of beach from Echo Beach Club to The Lawn and Old Mans. On low tide it was interesting to explore the rock pools. 
ClaytonWatson,"Daylesford, Australia",Jun 2018,We are spoilt in Australia with our pristine beaches and surfing wise this is a great beach as long as you can deal with being hassled by droves of surfers from near and far. There is so much rubbish on this beach and with the black sand it sticks out like a sore thumb. The river that drains out into it is not the cleanest but the only place for kids to play as the surf is very strong and the whitewash cleans up small ones very easily. The surf shacks and warungs along the beach are on the most part clean and offer good food but La Brisa is the only decent setup along here. Development will surely see this area cleaned up....hopefully!
Gary S,26 contributions,May 2018,"we go to Canggu  beach often just to relax and watch the sunset, or sometime just to walk the dog. or go to a local restaurant to swim and eat'"
Fabio Z,"Glis, Switzerland",May 2018,it‚Äòs a very nice place to enjoy the sea & the sun. good place to surf. way less crowded than kuta...
PCU,"Beijing, China",May 2018,Went there without any expectations. It was a surprise and I loved it. Black volcanic sand not very appealing at first sight. Wild but lovely. Great for surfing all day long. Different spots for different levels. It is not a fancy place for posh and trendy people. Great atmosphere and great sunset. 
madre&padre,Montenegro,May 2018,Biiiig sandy beach with big stone whos rise from water. Many nice restaurant and beach club with pool.
SalandPete,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Apr 2018,"Echo Beach and Canggu Beach near Old Mans is getting busier and busier, especially at sunset. Getting up at 530am for a surf makes no difference, it‚Äôs still really packed. The locals are making a great effort to pick up rubbish so it‚Äôs not as dirty as it used to be. A great place to watch the sunset with a Bintang or cocktail in hand!"
Alison W,38 contributions,Apr 2018,So peaceful and easy to find quiet time especially in the mornings. Great bars and cafes.  A walk from our fabulous villa down a quiet street also filled with fab organic and healthy cafes and yoga studio. It‚Äôs so peaceful here. 
Shaun T,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Apr 2018,This place has really boomed since I was here last and really catering to a hipster culture but keeping some of its traditional identity with the rice paddies and local architecture. Next time we come here I think we will base ourselves here as it is good for the family and still has the buzz. 
Andrea A,"Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain",Apr 2018,"Good place for relaxing on the deck chairs or doing some surf.The waves were high in the morning but the sea was calmer in the afternoon.I paid 50.000 IDR for a full day renting of a deck chair.There are many places were you can get drinks: beers, coconuts... "
SeonieNZ,"Papamoa, New Zealand",Jul 2017,"This place is like Burleigh or Nobby's Beach was to Surfers Paradise. Laid back, used to be forgotten, now it's becoming recognised and hipster cool popular. If Potato Head isn't your thin, chances are Canggu is. Hire scooters.Ride around. This is the place to relax, explore, and get to know Bali."
stargazerlily,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2018,"Not a beach to lay at all day. You;ll be asked to buy a sun lounger, and there are nicer beaches in the region with golden sand. It's a surfers beach. "
Stephanie M,7 contributions,Apr 2018,"Canggu reminds me very much of certain beaches in Southern California (Venice).  Lots of hipster (I don‚Äôt mean that in a bad way) food spots and stores, surfers, and a cool vibe.  The food was consistently good.  We‚Äôre very beginner at surfing.  I‚Äôve been both surfing and bodyboarding in Southern California and I felt it was pretty comparable.  The surf was a little choppy and blown out by the time we got there at 10.  We went back at 7 the next day and it was much better although we did not have time to surf the next day."
User749251,Louisiana,Mar 2018,"The beach is gorgeous black sand volcanic origin, Nice surfable waves, awesome sunsets! The city is bustling with activity!"
Zack S,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,"One of the few beaches we went to not littered with trash, but the beach slopes aggressively so there's not much room for activities. Not many vendors on the beach so you don't get bothered much, which is also nice, and there's several large beachfront restaurant / resorts to hang out in.The surf was garbage the day I was there. There was plenty of power behind it, but the break was super choppy with no great shape to the waves. The broke all over the place and inconsistently - there was not one peak to sit on, it was all over the place. And the wave breaks several times and backs off again, depending on the exact power behind the swell, so positioning is near impossible. The mid break seemed to be best - the outside broke and backed off again too quickly and the inside had too much interference. Might be OK with a heavier swell building the outside peak. It was ~4 feet when I was there."
Tamara4513,"Palma de Mallorca, Spain",Mar 2018,"I knew that its not a place for swimming but I didn¬¥t think that its so croudy. Its nice to walk along the seaside in the early morning or for sunset. Its very touristic, special full of surfer who ignore everybody except themselves-:))) Further up, leaving Canggu Beach there are less people and one can make long, long walks along the sea."
senay442,"Datca, Turkey",Mar 2018,"One of the surfers point in Bali. Sometimes really big waves and it is also fun to swim there. The beach is sand, there are sunbeds and sun shilds to hire, around 5-6 euro for two but it is ok without them also. There is a big club finn beach near and you can enter inside or chill outside on the sand free:)  There are surf rentals. You can find markets to grab water as well . It is one ofmy favorite spot for swimming , safe waves, energic young people around, no plastic in the sea and secure ( you can leave your stuff when you are swimming) not very crowded."
FalafelbarenSthlm,"Stockholm, Sweden",Mar 2018,"Dirty, dirt grey sand. Took a walk along the beach but didn¬¥t even bother to check the water temperature. Construction work along big parts of the beach. There is a few places where you can rent surf boards and sun beds. Canggu is where you go to eat good food, and surf."
kenoo300,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,"Sand is dark and can get hot but had good surf and is great for long walks with a few river crossings and a few spots where locals have setup food carts etc, especially on the weekends when the river mouths especially get packed with local families playing and picnicking, v which was great to see and get involved with."
Sola25,43 contributions,Mar 2018,"good location for waiting n seeing sunset, for learning surfing n sunbathing, can rent surfing board here"
Wanderer596696,27 contributions,Feb 2018,One of the better beaches in Bali where you won't be harrassed while trying to relax or have a chilled surf! Definitely worth checking out and grabbing a bite to eat or a drink afterwards at all the amazing places in canngu!
Lexy D,2 contributions,Jan 2018,"lovely beach, not too crowed, close to heaps of good restaurants and shops, good surfing and lots of nice instructors, close to fun bars, great crowd of people in that area in general"
Hellocapitano,"Gili Trawangan, Indonesia",Sep 2017,canggu is the new bali awesome restaurant  and bars good waves for surfing but i hope the beach will be more clean 
dsulaiman2018,"Goettingen, Germany",Feb 2018,"Forget visiting this beach if you prefer white sands and blue water. This one has its strong waves, just perfect for surfing and for those who like to challenge the nature power, with its black rough sands. No 5 star hotels, which claim it as their private beach, just small local bars and they offer drinks and nice food for quite small prices. I hope it stays like this forever."
ElizabethMcGuire,"Omaha, Nebraska, United States",Nov 2017,"The beach was nice enough. I don't surf, but there were amazing surfers out there doing there thing and it was entertaining to watch them. There are countless high quality restaurants in Canggu and some good spas as well. I had a great time in this town overall. It's disheartening to see the locals living in such poverty aside the foreign population living in abundance. "
Bo An,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Jan 2018,"Should visit, there is a choice for clubs, the water is clear. some of the clubs are quite expensive."
JHEILSTYLE,"Dayton, OH",Dec 2017,"Great beach for a sunset, but there is often a lot of trash after rain storms. Good place to surf, chill and have a beer or listen to music from Finn's Beach Club"
Anastasia N,"Riga, Latvia",Jan 2018,"The beach is quite dirty, but overall it‚Äôs good for surf because of big waves. Surf instructors and boards are all around. Not so many people (although we were in low season)."
Svennucsor,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2018,"We were there during low rainy season so it might be totally different in high season. The beach is ok but nothing special for Asian standards. Good surfing I guess, nice waves. Beach suffers from plastic invasion unfortunately. Beach is lined with small beach bars that all look the same and have limited choice of drinks and soso food, no WiFi. Stay away from Finns Beach if you don‚Äôt wanna be ripped off while thinking you‚Äôre special."
Jessica C,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,This is a very popular beach to learn to surf. The sand is quite dark so hot under your feet. A lot of fun beach bars and great for people watching. 
SuskiQ,Australia,Jan 2018,"I believe it is seasonal but the garbage on the beach was revolting. The water looked grubby but, if you‚Äôre a surfer, there were some nice waves at both Batu Belong and Echo Beach. "
marijetta,14 contributions,Dec 2017,"We went there for sunset and it was beautiful..nice wave to just stroll around. Not quite but not crowded, clean. We love it!!!"
clive g,"London, UK",Dec 2017,"Top up on the suncream if you're thinking of strolling along this beach. Watch the surfers, and swimming in marked safe areas. Watch the tide as there a couple of rivers running into the sea and at high tide getting across may become trickey. Lovely sand. Many places to stop for a drink or a bite to eat. All tastes catered for."
escapewithkitty,"Western Australia, Australia",Dec 2017,lovely walk down to the beach some rough weather and rain during monsoon takes the beach away... Still a great place to people watch!
angelinalaura,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"The Beach is not quiet, but clean enough, I entered from the gate next to Finn's Club.It has many coconut stalls, you can pick one and lay down on the bean bag they provide. the coconut price is Rp. 20.000 (approx. USD 1,5)."
Hizonfire,"Marikina, Philippines",Dec 2017,"The surf is probably for intermediate surfers as the swells are quite intimidating.The access stairs to the beach beside Finn Beach Bar is disgusting, since it's also the unfinished/haphazardly constructed sewer heading to the beach. We actually saw a rusty metal pipe from the opening head towards the beach - hope it doesn't hit anyone when the wave brings it back to shore.It seems the main attraction of this beach are the bars and party places around it, since the beach itself is honestly ho-hum with grayish sand and yes, trash littered around.Sunset is supposed to be spectacular but we didn't get to see it."
Elena P,Romania,Jun 2017,"This is a good, nice beach, very close to the place were we stayed. It was a bit dirty and we knew that from the owner of the place, but is a good place to make surf and relax a bit."
PerthYoga,"Perth, Australia",May 2017,"Nice drive out to some of the Northern Beaches. The beach was great, but I'm from Perth Australia so you will never get a 5 star out of me ;)"
darlygraham,"Tomar, Portugal",Dec 2017,"We're beach people and we'd been to several beaches around Bali for surfing spots. From all beaches, Canggu was the best place for it. Beach wasn't commercial, no locals sellers, and the sea was clear. Staying 5 days in Canggu and we chose it as our one of surfing lesson spot and it was an amazing experience.Will go for surfing lesson again!~next time."
TheresaSquit,"Philadelphia, Pennsylvania",Dec 2017,"This beach is disgusting. I don‚Äôt care how much you enjoy surfing, it is literally covered in trash.  So incredibly disappointing. I don‚Äôt know how anyone could recommend it.  "
catie231,London,Dec 2017,"Was very happy to be here. I hope  a pick up rubbish on the beach awareness community job starts because it would make the review five stars if there was no rubbish , bins for people to help clean up. It is an amazing place."
Joseph B,"Thousand Oaks, CA",Nov 2017,"What an amazing beach to spend the day. There are nice day beds, good food around the corner and it's nice to see the surfers in the water."
mikejlam,"New York City, NY",Dec 2017,We spend a couple of days at this beach. It was really nice. There were nice bars around and pretty girls to look at.
caddyandbellA,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,The beach is not the kind of place you want to throw a towel and swim but it is very pretty with rock formations etc.Lovely for a stross or a surf
HarryAuke,"Raalte, The Netherlands",Dec 2017,Lots of huge beach clubs and resorts together with some small place to get some cheap food or drinks. Beanbags or beach beds to sit in or lie on and an ideal place to see the beautiful sunset while everyone is in the water surfing. Unfortunately my surfing isn't that good.. lots to learn I suppose!
Scott K,"Sunrise Beach, Australia",Nov 2017,"Canggu beach is a major storm water out pour location , so unless you like wading around in all the filth that pollutes the streets then it is not hard to find somewhere better!Waves were average during my stay but I am told it does get good surf .You have to pay to park, halkers everywhere,  major construction sites on both sides and rubbish all around.I feel spoilt as I live where the beaches are so pristine but I can't help feel if you arrived here for your tropical beach getaway or honey moon the disappointment would  be unavoidable!"
Emm1702,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,Good place to surf. Not very crowded but beach still need some cleaning as it its quite dirty unlike Kuta.
suel442017,"Colorado City, CO",Nov 2017,"It is not for relaxing beach...but the place for surfer. The beach is not that clean, plenty hawkers around"
Coleta A,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2017,During daytime toe beach is soooooo cool with all the surf activities. What a vibes.During the night the beach turns into one big club..... excellent place to loose all stress
Nositha,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2017,"Not the best beach for swimming because of high waves,rocks and black sand. You will love it if you're into surfing. There's parties hosted on the beach which go on for all night and end at 4am, now those are  What make Canggu beach legendary!!"
Rick C,"Peregian Beach, Australia",Nov 2017,"Canggu is rubbish. Seriously, the beach itself is so over-rated. Sure, there‚Äôs is a good wave, bu other than that, it is an ugly beach and foreshore. Decrepit looking beach bars, dogs. Honestly, I don‚Äôt get it, I really don‚Äôt. All the nice restos and cafes are off the beach way up the various roads leading down, but why it is such a hub of excitement is more about the ‚Äòscene‚Äô methinks. Kuta has a better beach, just to put Canguu into perspective. "
jamesadamstone,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"The beach is quite nice but the water is dirty, the locals are very friendly, are lots of hotels and restaurants to eat at and surf schools and surfing but not suitable for kids. Strong currents."
Harrisp6,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"Shops very focused on the under 30 surf women and guys, A few good trendy cafes and only a couple of madssage places. very spread out so lots of walking with little shade as the road is through rice paddies."
Tour81093,4 contributions,Oct 2017,Popular surfing beach with decent breaks.  More accomplished surfers go outside while the inside is popular with those learning to surf and surf schools; can be busy as a consequence.  Super cool vibe though.  
Christian S,102 contributions,Sep 2017,"once a nice hidden spot, now crowded of vendor, pseudochiringuitos dirt, [people asking money also to breath.. only nice? sunset.. still a wow.. "
CassandraVeronica,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Echo Beach was a delight to visit, but we didn't swim in the water. We found Canggu overall a nice place to visit, especially with the cafes and beach clubs. However, we were robbed in Canggu whilst walking on the street to dinner one night. We were 4 women walking to the main strip to have dinner when 2 teenage boys drove past and snatched my friend's bag that she was holding against her chest. They grabbed her, tore her dress and shoved her to the ground. They almost rode over the two women in front of us and then rode off. Whilst this is expected everywhere in the world, we never thought it could happen to us, until it did. Be smart, be alert and be safe."
surfriend10,"Kuta, Indonesia",Oct 2017,Wonderful lifecangu the best palaces for surfGood local food and good prizes Papa enjoy mama happy
Jinooi,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,"The entire Canggu area is still relatively less crowded and commercialised than nearby Seminyak. Worth visiting and taking the slightly longer trip. Fewer shops selling touristy stuff, and many more small boutiques and craft shops that are worth checking out, especially if you are looking for good deals on ladies' summer apparel, beach wear and the like.The beach is also a favourite surfers' haunt especially for beginners, as the surf is not as big and less treacherous than those further up and down the coast.Favourite hangout for the hippie and hipster crowd."
biribiriblablab... .,40 contributions,Oct 2017,"The waves were good to surf, board rental was cheap (50'000). The beach was full of plastic though and also the water isnt very nice here...Some good restaurants though!"
Pier Francesco P,22 contributions,Oct 2017,The beach is good and have a lots of little spot when you can chill drinking a beer and relax for the sunset. You can learn how to surf for 350rps with 2 hours lesson but don't expect quality waves. The sea sometimes is full of plastic but I think it depend on the currents. In complex is a good beach but in the south area there are a totally different kind of beaches.
Bonitatravelblog,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2017,The beach isnt so beautiful but we enjoyed a lot watching the surfers.  We rented sunbed including parasol for 100k roepies.  Nice view and we enjoyed our visit to the beach
Alenka,"Squamish, Canada",Oct 2017,"i surf there all the time, chill people, chill place! canggu in general is one of my faves from Bali!"
seanpurcell,"London, UK",Aug 2017,Great place where many people who choose to make their life in Bali live and surf. As a big meat consume the vegan and vegetarian food is some of the best in the world and restaurants of all types great value. Sometimes easier to walk than take a bike/taxi as much of the area is dissected by canals /rivers which means having to go quite far inland to cross bridges
Crossfitfoodie,"Manila, Philippines",Oct 2017,"40 mins away from the luxury resorts of Seminyak lies a stretch of beach filled with surfers in various skill levels.Much more laid back than Bali's more popular beaches, Canggu Beach, as other reviewers have noted feel more authentic with villas on rice paddies, and eco-centered restaurant and hotel concepts."
John B,"Geelong, Australia",Oct 2017,Lovely quiet part of Bali with great surf and lots of traditional restaurants. Villas back onto rice paddies and hotels very eco- centred. Next area go be developed with a huge InterContinental hotel being built. Some very trendy places to visit.
beyschmidt,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,This is probably the best beach in Bali so far. We went to kuta and it was surrounded by Australians. Canggu felt like more authentic 
shaskify,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"me and my finnish friend just decided to go to canggu beach for sunbathing! it was sunday and a lot of people there from foreigners to local! mostly just chillin by the beach waiting for sunset or surfing! the wavez so good ! since im a big fans of doggo, you'll see a lot of doggos with their owner walking dog and doing some train! ah so cute!!!"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Sep 2017,Stayed in Canggu for 3 days and came down here every morning for a walk along the beach to watch Canggu go about its business.Not the best beach for swimming especially when the tide goes out it's best to learn to surf with many stalls catering for such.It is a good place to catch a sunset though...
Serena d,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"One of my fave beaches on the plant! Echo Beach has black, sparkling volcanic sand and amazing waves for surfing. Many call it the new Kuta as surfers flock from all over the world to catch waves on this beach. If you are taking a stroll along Echo beach you can enjoy a drink or something to eat at one of many bars and restaurants. My fave is called OLD MAN. Make sure you check it out if you are ever on Echo Beach.¬† To get to Echo, grab a scooter or uber and it is only around 5 mins from the rice paddies of Canggu in Bali."
Frieder S,41 contributions,Sep 2017,not ideal for Swimming due to Streaming and waves but perfect for Surfing / wave-boarding. Possibility for Long beach-walks and having some dinks at the various bars where even beach.chairs are being offered complimentary.
waatphoo,"Phuket, Thailand",Sep 2017,"Maybe this isn't the destination of the most favorite destinations in Bali. But for us this is the most beautiful part we have ever visited. Spending time here is amazing day. See the beauty of the beach, enjoying the fabulous evening view while surfing. A very worthy place to visit."
Whistler_nick,"Whistler, Canada",Sep 2017,"The beach is a little dirty and the surf can be a little packed but when 2hr board rental coasts 5AUD you can't complain. I rented from SandBar and they were easy enough. I even left my wallet, phone and hat in a basket with them and it was safe enough. The Bar sells Bali Hai (sorry no bintang) For about 2AUD and there is live music in the evening. Better Spot to watch the sunset than Old Mans but the ""Bar"" is more of a shack... but thats half the charm. Note: 3/5 stars because it was a semi dirty beach"
Traveler531579,2 contributions,Sep 2017,This place has construction non stop building everywhere. Way over crowded waves if u like to surf. Don't waste your time.
misopiso88,"Seattle, WA",Jun 2017,"If you are looking for great surf, fun restaurants and KILLER sunsets, Canggu Beach is the perfect place.  Easy to rent a surf board and go yourself or find an instructor for lessons. Highly recommend!"
Nicole G,Oakenden,Sep 2017,Very dirty/littered but lovely location. Waves/surf is pretty intense. I wouldn't go in. üòâ lovely sunsets. Going to try the roast corn üåΩ   
Jen G,35 contributions,Sep 2017,"The rubbish made the beach totally unappealing and smelly. There are a few nice bars along the beach for sure, but as far as beaches go.... nothing to write home about "
ffthomaz,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,"First beach we went on Bali. Nice surprise.Dark sand, great waves and perfect for a stroll until Seminyak. You can walk for hours and there is a great choice on spots were you can eat and drink. If you see the La Laguna bridge, get inside. Great spot."
DawnAllwood,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,It's not the best beach we spent most of our time at the Lawn Beach Club. Free to get in but you are obliged to buy a drink from the bar at least
arcorace2,"Coogee, Australia",May 2017,"Love Canggu Beach great spot with excellent cafe and restaurants, more choices of shopping plus away from busy Kuta"
FloS827,"San Francisco, CA",Sep 2017,"There's some litter along the beach, but expected in Bali if it's not a private beach. The surf is nice with beginner waves and lots of surf shops opening at 6am to rent boards, have lessons. Shops close around 6:30pm. Surf shops all charge the same price and do not bargain - seems like they all decided on the same deal so they'd all be paid decently. As of September 2017, prices are 50k to rent a board (lots of great selections) and 550k for a 2 hour lesson (one on one instruction). If you want to surf more by yourself you'll have to rent a board again."
Jasmyn M,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Aug 2017,"The sand is black, and it's not the cleanest of beaches, but maybe we are spoilt in Australia. I think there are far nicer beaches in Bali, saying that the surfs great and some great cheap little restaurant shacks"
Elin T,Europe,May 2017,"As with almost all the popular beaches here, they are flooded with people. Too many for my taste. Not fun to surf here as there are simply too many fighting for the smallest waves. Go to another island in Indonesia for better surf experience. "
Justyn Jen Gourdin,"Luxor, Egypt",Jul 2017,I love hanging out at this beach. The surf seems pretty good for beginners. Always good to grab a coconut and hang out in the sun for a while.
justjj78,"Glasgow, UK",Aug 2017,"I loved it, sunsets with a roasted corn on the cob and a large Bintang to wash it down and a stroll on the sand......life was made for these moments.You can walk a long way on the sand, just be sure to keep yourself suitably hydrated üòâ"
VinceVW,Singapore,Aug 2017,The beach is beautiful and it is great for surfing. There are many beach goers who are there to suntan or to go for surfing.There are surf boards for rental and also great drinks store overlooking the great beach.
jillziegirl,"Bend, OR",Aug 2017,"I heard Canggu was a popular spot.  Then, when I got there, I would have to add...Popular Spot if you like tourists.Also, the beach, although beautiful, is not maintained - lots of dog poo and general trash.  If the Westernized business owners decide to invest here, there should be some sort of commitment in their licensing to clean up the beaches that draw people to Canggu."
"Dr. Tjoe K. Sugiharto, MBA, DTh.","Canggu, Indonesia",Aug 2017,Best American Cheese Burger with oldies milkshake vanilla as well as jungle fries with melted cheese with bacon crumb.It's really heavenly food.
Codyjturnbull,8 contributions,Aug 2017,"Check out surfers warung for the coldest coconuts and othree for their breakfast jaffle, maybe best jaffle on the island"
Kiran V,Belgium,Aug 2017,"The beach is realy cosy and there is every evening live music. There they sell a lot of things. The best thing they sell are the medium spicy corns which are delicious. The waves are for beginners and medium surfers, but there are also big waves if you peddle deep for more advanced surfers."
Portolana,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"A cluster of small places where to grab a bite and hang out, but right on the beach they are just finishing what looks like a  very fancy place. If you do not surf you can seat very carefully on the huge black rock spitted out from a vulcano  thousand years ago"
VJDee,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Aug 2017,A fantastic place for those who want to hang out by the beach or learn to surf. We spent 2 wonderful days there and we loved every moment of it. Lots of drink vendors along the beach and you can use their beach chairs if you order drinks from them too. Highly recommended. 
nickenhanneleen,"Bornem, Belgium",Aug 2017,"How can a beach not be lovely..? Can be busy (during high season) and includes some good surfing breaks. Next to the beach are some bars where you can eat and drink. Good spot to watch sunset.Tip:Park your scooter a bit before the beach, in that manner you avoid some parking costs ;)"
Beebyontour,"Leicester, UK",Aug 2017,Stayed in a hotel a 5 minute walk away from Canggu beach and had many happy experiences there. There is a good selection of beach bars/restaurants/cafes along the beach front and this beach is very popular with the local/expat Surf community. When I visited I saw some of the biggest waves I'd ever seen whilst walking along this beach. Stunning place to just look out and watch the sea at it's finest. Would definitely recommend a visit!
Jean-Pierre V,"Vilvoorde, Belgium",Aug 2017,Nice vibe all along from Echo beach to Olds Man. Lot of warungs. Huge waves at Echo beach. Cheap food and drinks. DJ & live music on the beach at Sandbar.
K√ºbra,"Hannover, Germany",Jul 2017,"Canggu is a nice beach maybe for Surfers but not as good as the beaches in southern Bali in Uluwatu. Canggu is a nice area for cool cafes and Restaurants and a relaxed atmosphere, but the beach is nothing Special."
L√©anne D,14 contributions,Jul 2017,"Beautiful beach with soft black sand. Not too many people, that was really appreciated. The water was a at a perfect temperature to be refreshing, but the waves were really strong so we couldn't go very far. "
Margalee,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jul 2017,"Clean and beautiful white sands,not so crowded as other beach at Bali,  good waves and offers many good hotels nearby. "
SushiX,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2017,"Nice beach with exceptional sunsets. Big waves and big difference between low and high tide. Excellent for surfing, hanging, bathing n chillin "
PSingal,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2017,"the beach sand was nice - mostly light cream colored soft with a little volcanic black mix here and their, the water had some huge waves - ideal for surfing , they even have several surfboard rentals available for about 50k IDR per 2 hours , and surf lessons beginning from 250k IDR per 1.5 hours. not recommended for snorkelling as visibility is not great, but good for swimming in the beginner surfing area.if u just want to sun bathe they have resting chairs on hire too"
lexeneandrews,"Woodgate, Australia",Jul 2017,"This road is my favorite shopping destination.  Great shops, plenty of places to eat , more laid back and relaxed.."
derbiggyz,9 contributions,Jul 2017,Beautiful place to meet a lot of cool people and to start surfing. In some days there is a very big Party in the Evening. I will defenetly Come back to this place.
Joannes Rhino,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Canggu Beach is bordering a coastal village on the island with its typical black sands of the coastline for this area. The beaches in this area including Batu Bolong, Echo, and Canggu have the necessary surf breaks that are extremely getting popular these days among surfers across the world. The area around the beach is also scenic in nature with well-maintained rice fields that makes it one of Bali‚Äôs chosen expatriate regions as well as surfing zone. From novice to experienced surfers, this coastal region offers everyone something of their choice. "
Heather Boom,California,Jul 2017,"This is a great spot of you want beach with waves to learn to surf or better if you already know how (as the waves are a bit more Challenging). A super social atmosphere with TONS of young travelers speaking the beach and parties and there are tons of places to eat and drink! Seminyak is just next door but not as popular so you can stay here and then day trip or even go for a Saturday night if a bigger club is your thing. I stayed at a place just off the beaten path and it was quieter, yet I had all the goodness of canggu a 5-10 minute scooter ride away. Also the shopping is great with lots of trendy places to get in your retail therapy if the sun isn't out;) "
Andy S,"Hamburg, Germany",Aug 2016,"As I wrote before about Bali, this is an other beach that you should visit and also the best place for sunset... it's not too crowded as other beach on bali but it's one of most visited beach"
Gladstone21,"Napier, New Zealand",Jul 2017,"Great surfing here, has a rocky bar which is especially prevalent at low tide. Sandy nearer the beach front. But for swimmers, again especially at low tide, not far off the beach front the surface underfoot turns to tangles of weeds or bare slippery rocks. There is lots of bits of weed floating about making it a bit unpleasant to swim in. Stay ni the pool. The nearby Aston Hotel has an awesome rooftop pool with some loungers sitting in the water (shallow) by the bar. Might be a different story at high tide??? The weed will still be there!On the beach there are numerous Warungs with the usual Indo food, beer, drinks, sarongs, shorts, surfboards and boogie boards for hire and good one on one surfing schools around R300000 Indo for an hour + lesson. "
jasonphoto,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"I've lived in Bali for 10 years now and have to say that I really really miss the old canggu... The hipster surf tourist trap that it's become makes me sad enough to cry real tears. It was so nice back when it was just cows, Black sand, a few little places to eat breakfast, and good uncrowded surf... but such is Bali."
Louise Q,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,A good beach ... many locals come here Great sunsets Not many tourists when we were there (ie none) Walkable to beach clubs for more pampering and beach beds for $$ if required 
Jerry T,"Destin, FL",Jul 2017,"This beach is clean. Nice waves and lots of sand. If you don't want to pay Finns Beach Club  prices turn right, walk pat Finns and there are several small bars with tables and bean bags. "
Claire E,41 contributions,Jul 2017,A great afternoon spent here and a must see in Bali! A little Seminyak!!! Walk to the beach and lawn hotel. Beautiful
Maureen F,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,Beautiful beach and great place to walk. I was able to walk from the hotel (Aston Canggu) to Seminyak - took about an hour but a beautiful walk. 
Hooggenoeg,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jul 2017,"This beach is nothing special, the sea is also quite rough, best for surfers. Rather go to one of the surrounding beach clubs where there are amenities etc."
amrita_77,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",May 2017,Beautiful beach...flooded with foreigners..lots of dogs are found in the beach..one of the best pet friendly beaches.Sunset is spectacular.Many restaurants and bars are nearby..local as well as continental and Asian cuisine is available with loud music.
Diego M,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Jun 2017,Ideal place for surfing (or so it seems). The back sand is absolutely amazing and the whole area is nice to walk. Good restaurants and definitely a place you must go even if you do not sure but enjoy a nice view of the sea.
TropicalLover,"Pennsylvania, USA",Jun 2017,"This is a surfing beach and a great place to watch them. A little rough for kids or just swimming. Black sand and a lot of dogs roaming around so not a place foe siyting on the beach, but more of an attraction to watch surfing."
Tala Halawa,"Ramallah, Palestinian Territories",Jun 2017,"Clean in the morning, gets dirty through the day. Good for surfing, many surfing services are available. You can rent sun beds for the whole day, you'll be annoyed by salesmen/saleswomen, just ignore them. "
idweaver,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"Overcrowded with dogs, people, motor bikes, surfers and nightclubs. Don't take your shoes off to walk in the sand or you may get hookworm like we did. So many dogs pooping on the beach. Not a quite place to come any more. "
KrugerHop,"Cabo San Lucas, Mexico",Jun 2017,"Black sand surfing and sunset beach with everything from primitive huts on the beach serving cheap Bintangs, to famous Old Mans, to the laid back ""Lawn"", and at the top end of the scale, the Tugu hotel beachside sundeck.   And many excellent restaurants a short walk up Jln Batu Bolong.   Cool and relaxing vibe."
LorinE-lovestotravel,"Sunbury, Australia",Jun 2017,"From the moment we arrived in Canggu we loved it.. so much quieter and laid back than Kuta, Seminyak and Legian.  The beach has fine black sand with Warungs and restaurants dotted all the way along with bean bags and bars to take in the views and sunsets while enjoying a Bintang or two.  "
lcheney46052,"Concord, NH",Jun 2017,The beach is probably fine for surfing but you have to ask yourself a few questions- what's in the dirty water that drains into the ocean all day long?  Why can't the locals and the hotels help these poor dogs?  They are sick and take away from the experience of being able to enjoy the beach. 
Summa77,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Jun 2017,We stayed a week in an air BnB villa. Was only 150 metres to beach but not once did we swim or surf. The surf was to big for our little fella (9) and I can't say the beach was appealing at all. Echo beach had a surf comp on for the first 3 days too. Not the best timing. However the healthy food options in this area made up for the crap beaches. If you don't surf I say there are nicer places in Bali to go. 
INK,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"If you wanna go here, better in the early morning. cause it will get crowded and the beach is not really clean."
Darren v,11 contributions,Jun 2017,"Canggu beach is very relaxed. Less tourist and normal prices for drink,food and a bed to lay in the sun."
mcclarenk,"San Diego, CA",May 2017,"least favorite beach we visited, we preferred Barawa or Legian. Good for sunset, but very crowded. They sell cheap corn and coconuts on the beach though which was nice."
very-sunny,"Lodz, Poland",Mar 2017,I can't understand why people come to this dirty beach of black sand full of garbage and waste. Except good wave for surf there is nothing else unless you want a drink on the crowded noisy beach . 
16amandaz,"Eaton, Australia",May 2017,"Gorgeous beach but very busy. People everywhere. Can watch from up above at Old mans restaurant, unsure if ok for swimming, may be best for surfing"
919818,"Shanghai, China",May 2017,Good place to catch some waves and do more extreme water activities. Wouldn't recommend it if you're into crystal blue waters. 
Thomas Quinlan,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"This is a black sand beach that's quite near the various villas in Canggu. It's walkable without issue, and the water was the perfect temperature when we went in January. There were a lot of surfers about, and speaking of the water, the thing that makes it a good surf spot - strong waves - means you really must be careful if you venture out into the water for a swim. (We didn't - just meandered down the beach with our toes in the surf that came up.) There's not a lot of cover for those of us that might need some shade, so if the equatorial sun isn't your thing make sure you have sunblock and/or an umbrella. (Those might be advisable generally.) We didn't find too many amenities along the beach, but then we weren't really looking for any either."
Alex W,"Ely, UK",May 2017,"We lived about 10min away from this beach while in Bali. This beach is a black sand volcanic beach so don't expect white sparkling sand and clear blue water, but the beach is clean and so is the water. Lots of surfers which is fab to watch. Finns beach club offers nice drinks and food to sit and watch the sunset too. Fab beach that's not overcrowded or messy"
maleeam23,"Bozeman, MT",May 2017,"This beach is excellent! Lots of surfers and lots of people (Canggu is primarily Australian tourists) but the beach is very clean!! There are some really nice spots to get in the water and play with the waves. Lots of good people watching, and lots of little shops right on the beach with chairs, surf boards for rent and bintang/coconuts for sale. We were staying right down the road so being so close to this beach was amazing!! Highly recommend"
triki997,Western Australia,Jan 2017,Canggu Beach is a black sand volcanic beach which makes it look a little unattractive for us Australians used to white sand and sparkling blue seas. However I found it a really good place to hang out and have conversations with fellow travellers at various bars that line the sand. These range from wildly expensive (Western priced) complete with swimming pools and lovely lounging furniture through to cheap little warnings which offer bean bags under beach umbrellas. There was a bit of surf when I was there and its possible to hire boards. I am a little reluctant to swim in south Bali ocean because of poor  sewage and a big population but lots of people were taking the plunge. It was boisterous sea so be careful if you are a weak swimmer - lots of sandbanks and turbulence. Excellent for big beach walks.
Rebeca C,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2017,"Quiet spots can be found, not too overcrowded with westerners - looked like lots of surf schools in the morning"
Don D,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,Visited Canggu or Echo beach to see the surf and the sunset.the surf was reasonable and the waves were crowded all day. There appeared to be some significant rips and not a good place for the learner or poor swimmer.Good the have a beer in the bars and watch.
Tereza R,"Prague, Czech Republic",Apr 2017,"You can rent surfboards for 50,000 for 2 hours. Easy rolling waves, but gets crowded. There's a good club Old Man's for evening after surf fun."
Rio R,1 contribution,May 2017,Nice clean peaceful beachüëç. The deckchairs much more cheaper like in Kuta. The food delicious and the coconuts fresh ancient cold üòÉ
Ahmad G,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Apr 2017,Not a good place to learn to surf even. As a strong swimmer. No warning signs............ Shoukd have flags at least 
David,"Canton of Zurich, Switzerland",Apr 2017,"We were several times at the beach, visited The Lawn, some beach bars etc. We liked the mood before sundown very much, as there is a friendly mix of locals, tourists, surfers, dogs and cats and the light is indescribable at sundown! Best to enjoy with a cold bintang beer from the many tiny beach bars."
datstar1,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Canggu beach is of black sand and stretches for some distance. You will find surfers mostly from Europe and the United States being carefree and chasing waves. Naturally, you'll also find Australians due to the proximity. As you reach the beach at the end of Jl Pantai Batau Bolong, you will find bars, cafes and restaurants serving hungry tourists and surfers. There are also surf boards for hire. The main mode of transport to get here is by scooter which can be hired almost anywhere or taxi. It is also a great spot to watch the sun set or just pop on one of the sun lounges set up by locals with their little shacks that sell beers and soft drinks and food. The lounges are free if you purchase a beverage with them. At sun down, the locals with their families come and enjoy the cooler part of the day with children playing, whilst others enjoy a pleasant beach stroll and soak in the relaxed atmosphere."
Michael S,"Bilpin, Australia",Apr 2017,"Ok beach says it all. Not great but ok. Has black volcanic sand. I'd prefer sandy coloured sand. But hey, Bali has bit of everything. "
Justine S,17 contributions,Apr 2017,The beach had a fun environment with delicious corn on the cob being sold at sunset.  The waves are too big for swimming with small children.  Good for beginner surfers on the days we were there.
Ketut M,1 contribution,Apr 2017,Nice beach and love this and coming again and with friends and gain wi5h friend clean wave and surfer
Chayen V,"Schiphol, The Netherlands",Apr 2017,Lots of waves on the beach. Perfect for surfers. Not so much for swimming. Lots of cafes and restaurants where u can enjoy the view.  
matusruza,"Pohronska Polhora, Slovakia",Apr 2017,"If you are looking for a place to start or try surfing, go here like we did..  Even it was too crowded in my opinion, we still had a good time. Easy to rent surf and take a guide"
Tommy1501,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Ok beach for a visit. Not really pretty or inviting but good for our teenage sons who love bodyboarding. The day we went was a little rough and probably a bit too rough for them but they hired boards and fins $8AUD for a set and still had a paddle which they said was a good experience. We were able to hire sun beds and an umbrella to sit under and watch the boys for $5AUD each. Personally I prefer a more picturesque beach. 
Lenichik,"Rosebud, Australia",Apr 2017,This was the first time we came to Canggu. Our friends suggested it to go surfing. It had heaps of people out surfing but really sad to see how filthy the water was. The oil could be seen in every break of a wave and even human waste. Not a place I would swim. The beach bars closed pretty early and had a much quieter vibe than other places. Just really sad to see how dirty it was. 
Michael A,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Two teenage sons learned to surf here from good local surf teachers so this will always be remembered.   Though the sand is brown which is a shock for Western Australians, the hangs outs and shopping were great while the kids learned to surf and even though we lived in relative luxury eslewhere in Bali, this was the place our teenagers.  It also had the best and best fun restaurants we visited in our seven weeks in Bali which is saying something."
Tiago F,"Porto, Portugal",May 2016,It's one of the best spots for longboard surfing. It works everyday! The beach is sometimes a bit dirty but the water makes up for it. Hot and with a lot of waves.
Antoinetta B,58 contributions,Mar 2017,"Canggu beach was not crowded and peaceful.  Fun to watch the surfers and cool off in the water.  Only distraction are the several people selling jewelry, etc on the beach.  Approaching you continually with offers for bracelets and other items.  The prices are great and a good deal however, these folks can be relentless.  I learned quickly to ""just say no"" as politely as possible."
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2017,A great. Beach to visit if you are a surfer. A long open beach with some coral to avoid. A lot of locals surfing so be prepared to use your surfing etiquettes. Umbrellas and chairs for hire if needed. Lots of local food outlets as well. 
Briohny R,8 contributions,Apr 2017,Despite the densely populated residential area of Canguu the beach is really pleasant and inviting.  Loads of surfers so enjoy!!
Green_Gabriella,"Miami, FL",May 2016,"I wouldn't say this is a paradise beach, but it is a nice beach with culture and small temple structures in walking distance. A lot of the locals come here and also tourists so it's a mix. Surfers would often be out in the water. I stayed right along Canggu beach for my Yoga Teacher Training and so we would come here often to do Yoga or just walk along the beach. If you are in the area, definitely come by. But if you have no purpose coming to the area, I'd say you're probably not missing much."
davidtjones,"Bawtry, UK",Mar 2017,Cracking food - you order from the wall with menu written on with marker pen! Me and the wife had breakfast bowls which were really good! It was a little slow but also seriously busy so understandable.
Jessi-leigh B,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,"After leaving seminyak we turned heading to Canggu we were stoped by police, this is a known corner! Make sure to always wear helmets! And get a international driving permit from RACQ before heading over also carry small amount of cash just in case police fine you! $30 Aus "
Marquestra | A Quest for Travel,"Montreal, Canada",Mar 2017,"The area has a great vibe but the beach is not a sun worshipers paradise, it's absolutely in line with the areas surf community... Sand is volcanic, water is quite agitated!"
iliyasmd,"Melaka, Malaysia",Mar 2017,"Beautiful Beach, shared a coconut with my wife while enjoying the breeze and ocean waves. Can't find any halal shopes so didn't have any food by the beach, but there are plenty of shopes offering varies seafood meals  with cheap price.. "
Juliahelenius,"Helsinki, Finland",Mar 2017,Dont go there with kids or who cant handle the massive waves. Its good if you can surf (like really well) but not for beginners. Many restaurants near and you can rent a chair. 
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"This place has a soft black sand and a big wave so that you could easily find surfers here. if you walked through this beach to the north, you will find that this beach is connected with echo beach"
Ben M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,We walked to and around the Canggu beach every morning we stayed in the area - has a very different vibe to Seminyak and nowhere near as busy. Lots of Bali dogs to see in the area too.
Opal Bin,"Lightning Ridge, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2017,"Look, as long as you are not expecting pristine white sand, the beach is very nice. Good waves for surfing, the area is stunning with lots of small bars and restaurants. The area and the beach are nice and quiet and perfect to watch the sun set"
Madison M,"Calgary, Alberta",Jan 2017,"I love this beautiful beach. The sea is not very nice, the beach as well but many places to drink something and watch the sunset."
Trendpunk,"Dauin, Philippines",Feb 2017,"The amount of rubbish is terrible. The place is beautiful, but surfing and hitting bags, paddling into them. To be blunt it was like surfing in a rubbish tip. There are nicer places and I could have hit a bad week. Don't judge Bali on this review! My experience was sadly 1star"
Laine_Leon,"Hertfordshire, UK",Apr 2016,"Canggu is a place where you will enjoy a chill, relaxing vibes by the beach. full of specialty coffee shops and if your a foodie you have at least try out some of the coffee shops and restaurant in Canggu.for a drink out session with friends, I suggest Deus Cafe in Canggu and check out Old Mans for the list of events."
tikimodph,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"Batu Bolong has it all: Many healthy cafes, shops, surf board and motorbike rentals, spas, rooms for rent, warungs, ice cream, night clubs, convenience and drug stores and don't forget the beach!  Probably the most popular beach in Canggu!"
Shakira S,"Munich, Germany",Feb 2017,Lovely and clean beach however during the rainy season expect to see a lot of plastic trash wash up on shore. 
Zackery J,"Fresno, CA",Feb 2017,The black sand makes for an interesting scene. The beach is far and away better than kuta's beach. Surf looks better as well. Good bars near the beach also!!
Bri bri,Melbourne,Jan 2017,"We visited the beach club twice - it cost about $100 for 2 adults and 2 kids to enter then meals and drinks were additional (about $70-100 with a cocktail each and lunch). The kids had a great time on the slides, rope swing and lazy river - the pools were clean - toilets could be a bit better. The food and drink options were good! Was it worth the money - unless you utilize all the facilities- id say no, but it allowed the kids to be entertained while allowing us to relax, read books, do laps or head to the gym.What is that worth to you?? I do think they should include towels in the entrance fee for the price they charge.. "
JohannesAdhi,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,It's a nice beach. Not many people went here but I think soon  will be more to come. Quiet and have nice wafe for surf
Lisset N,28 contributions,Jan 2017,"For surfers but also for just visitors wanting to have a relaxed day, you can enjoy it from one of the clubs or from the small spots drinking a coconut... worth to visit it :)"
Ruth K,"New York City, NY",Jan 2017,Okay so this beach would be good for surfing and nothing else AT ALL! It's filthy crowded and doesn't have any proper seating or spot for relaxation. I'm not a trendy or luxury loving kind of person. I just want a nice beach and a place to put my towel. This one is not it.
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Black sand beach and very quiet...water unsuitable for swimming but you can find surfers here enjoying with average waves...
Harishnee G,Roodepoort,Jan 2017,"The staff here really know what they are doing . Visited a different spa and they couldn't compete to the competence of the staff here.Had a pedicure and foot massage - reflexology done , highly recommend this."
The Brit & The Blonde,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2016,"We've lived in Canggu now for a month and love the area, all the side streets and buzzing around on the scooter. The actual beach though is dirty, simple as that. Its good for sunsets but to be honest its covered with bamboo and a lot of plastic and its very sad to see. Cant help but feel that the restaurants and bars should chip in to pay for regular cleaning, provide more bins, or get to the root of the problem and not sell plastic at all."
monidaly,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"The beach in Canggu is dirty. Very dirty. There is rubbish everywhere, so it is not a nice beach to walk along and it was not tempting to go for a swim there."
Neil W,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"When i first visited Canggu you had to ride motor bikes through the rice paddies and there wasn't a warung to be seen. Now there are all sorts of trendy restaurants, bars and shops. It's got very upmarket but the beach itself remains the same -  black sand and good surf on the right day. Gets pretty crowded but it is a big beach. "
Cecille_DXB,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"It was my first time to try it and gladly, i went to the right place.the waves werent too bad, and the beach has a few cafes and shops that offer to teach beginners. if you know how to surf,.you can rent a board here. there are numerous surfers in the area as well, you can just buy a beer and a meal and watch them hit the waves!"
Siobhan O,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Dec 2016,"Booked a lesson in the first surf school you get to in the Carpark- they gave me a lesson with Yasno and he was amazing, learned so much from him - had tried a few lessons elsewhere with limited success but this lesson with Yasno helped me fix some errors and really get into the fun of it!"
Laura P,98 contributions,Dec 2016,"This beach is not the greatest. Definitely the dirtiest beach I have seen, with a lot of plastic littering the shoreline and the sand. There are lots of cute spots on the beach to rent a sunlounge and get a drink or a bite, but it's a real shame there is so much rubbish everywhere spoiling the natural beauty of the place. Canggu is a great little place and there are a lot of lovely cafes and rice fields just a few streets up from the beach. It's a shame that rapid development of the region has led to the beach being trashed. "
kingey6,"Nelson Bay, Australia",Dec 2016,"Best surf beach probably in Bali..Walk from Kuta,all the way along this beach to Cancun.. Reach lv8 & Finns"
Nzcysi,73 contributions,Dec 2016,Less crowded and touristic from Seminyak. Still raw which I like. Good place to surf. Nice beach and waves. 
Yogi_Kris,"Los Angeles, CA",Nov 2016,"I don't see what the fuss is about. The area is really spread out, so you need a scooter. There are a bunch of hipsters and digital nomads, so whatever charm the area may have had has kind of been gentrified away.Yes, you can surf, but the beach isn't actually very nice. Like most beaches in Bali it's full of garbage, especially plastic! (On that note, PLEASE, think twice before you take a plastic bag at the store and buy a reusable water bottle.... be a responsible consumer.)"
Mal M,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"A lovely beach with good surfing. Plenty of surf boards for rent and a no hassle when it comes to laying on the beach and enjoying a cool drink. If you do not want to rent a beach chair, move a little further down the beach and lay your towels down . Plenty of parking for motorcycle or car. There is also little tent cafes where you can have a cool drink with some finger food . Prices are reasonable . There are also quite a few hotels to choose from and all walking distance to the beach . It always from the minding crowd and if a quiet holiday this is the beach for you , you will however need to take about 30 to 50 mins to go to the town of Bail as the roads are small and packed with motor bikes and little cars . A word of advice , its humid so go in light cotton ware . Enjoy . "
Brendan B,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"I am so pleased to say that the photo on this listing doesn't do Canggu justice in any way. You need to spend time in Canggu, there is so much beauty. For this my first trip I decided to keep it simple by sitting and watching a stunning sunset while eating BBQ corn and Bintang Raddler, then eating more BBQ corn and drinking more Bintang Raddler.Just perfect!"
Nick,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2016,"A nice unpretentious hangout, which is the perfect place to learn to surf if you don't already. Super cheap to rent boards and a big enough break to cater for the 100's people out at any one time. Surrounded by a few cool bars (Finns, Old man's) and good restaurants a short walk away (ex machina, Betelnut). I could spend my whole time here! "
nurse_gail,"Budgewoi, Australia",Aug 2016,Cangu to me is the new legion. With great restaurants beach close by and some markets its worth a look
Rnaat_S,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",Nov 2016,We had much fun on the beach with our bodyboards but trying to surf was out of the question. The waves are close by the beach already very high and powerful so we stuck to our bodyboards. There are almost no hustlers on the beach and it is relatively quiet. There are a lot of dogs but they are sweet and most of them are taken care of by the community. 
Dale g,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2016,"the wave here holds its shape well considering its a open beach break. on the bigger days  , its a difficult paddle. there is a few places to rent boards - so you see alot of begginers in the water but food , beer and plenty of places to visit on the beach. "
DiAplo,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Nov 2016,"Too many tourist people, most of them drinking in the bars wich are located right at the entrance. There is a lot of traffic also wich make this beach ""stressful"" and dirty."
TereRazmilic,"Santiago, Chile",Nov 2016,"Is perfect for learning to surf. In the parking there is a place for board rental and you can take some classes. Here we met our dear friend and teacher ""adi"". If you want to learn to surf, this is your place."
niknak1968,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"I love my beaches and unfortunately this beach we went to in Canggu was not nice at all. I am very spoilt living in Western Australia with our beautiful ocean and gorgeous clean beaches and sand. Rubbish was all around us, ocean not inviting what so ever . Was glad to get off the beach ."
Benadvisorr,France,Sep 2016,its very packed and competitive for space and the ozzy pros take center stage its not a negative as people are free spirited and will help you on you surf ( just don't get in there way lol)
Josh F,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach is different to other parts of Bali and less beautiful than the cliff beaches of Uluwatu or Gili Islands. The swell was only a few feet, but it changes with the seasons depending on the coastline. BOARD RENTAL in the car park outside Old Man's Bar and 2,000RPI parking so boogie boards, short/long surf boards can be picked up for the day to avoid lugging back to hostels/hotels. SURF LESSONS are also offered down by the beach (price unknown) but heaps of guides sitting around so negotiating a price shouldn't be hard. "
johnseminara,"Maroubra, Australia",Mar 2016,Canguu beach is located about 30 minutes drive from Legian in a beautiful spot with surrounding rice fields the beach has black sand that you won't find at most beaches in Bali. For surfers it's a awesome spot with 3 different surfing spots a good left hand break that has some unreal tubes then you have a A frame peak in the middle of the beach that serves up some really nice waves and a little bit further down the beach is a really good right hand reef break that offers up some unreal tubes and long rides. Being a bit out of the way it doesn't get as crowded as some of the other surf breaks in Bali but try and get there early in the morning and you should get in a great surf at one of the 3 main breaks there are also some nice waves to be found around the area just go for a walk along the beach and you are sure to find some waves with no one out there  and if you get hungry after a lond surf there are many warungs to get almost anything that you could want to eat so go and check it out I'm sure that you will have a great surf there.
queen2534,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,"Such shambolic development was a disappointment. After hearing all the glossed up stories of this beautiful spot, it was not hard to see that commerce had moved in too fast. The road hasn't been built to accommodate the mass of motorists and the sea front development reminded me of St Kilda beach in the 50's. All opportunistic grabs at the tourist market. From 2 star eateries to expensive fashion boutiques for heaven's sake. No aesthetics here. Sorry Canngu."
Daffa W,3 contributions,Nov 2016,This place is much chance now come here for first time in last 3 years was feel like rural and i dont know canggu transporm in to fast tourist area in bali 
soniamarietheberge,"Calgary, Canada",Sep 2016,I don't understand the appeal. I'm sure you can find a better beach to surf at. This was officially the dirtiest beach I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of beaches. We stayed one night and left for Ubud.
paranoid999,29 contributions,Oct 2016,"Basically a Surfing beach filled with droves of  people learning to surf. Waves break on a seaweed covered reef and booties may be advisable during low tide. The beach itself is not fantastic, the black sand and litter may put visitors off unless they are there to surf.The Sunset is lovely and just down the street leading towards Batu Bolong beach there are many restaurants doing vegan/raw/gluten free food. There are also many places to learn yoga nearby. The overall vibe is friendly and warm."
peterc1100,bangkok,Feb 2016,"A great place to get away from the hustle & bustle of Kuta or Seminyak. Great restaurants, nice places to stay, surf beach.."
Nic R,22 contributions,Oct 2016,"We really love staying here,  usually closer to Pererenen Beach.  Over there its quiter and calmer,  but still close enough to great eating spots and beaches.  We will stay here again.  "
ChristianneQ,"Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway",Oct 2016,Batu Bolung:  there are several beaches in Canggu.  Visited this beach waiting for husband on a surf lesson. The lava sand beach is basic and caters mostly for young surfers. There are a few basic restaurants serving reasonable food and dwellers on the beach rent out surfboards and beds/umbrellas. Surflessons available. The sea is pretty rough and not so suitable for swimming. There is a small charge for parking. The place does get crowded in the afternoon. If you're looking for a beach holiday this is not the place to be. Very popular among surfers. Locals are very friendly.
Ylann R,5 contributions,Oct 2016,"Really not a nice place to hang out, but surfers did seem to enjoy it. The place is surrounded by litter and stray dogs. Restaurants around serve bland food.On the positive side, the view of the ocean is really nice. If you don't surf you should avoid this place IMO. There are much nicer beaches to see in Indonesia"
JanResnick,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,This is a great beach if you're 25 +/- and into surfing and chasing girls wearing a little more than a string.I'm not but I had a lovely walk.
lilian147,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"Very beautiful beach, especially for surfing.¬† Nice waves! Lots of surf clubs to choose. My¬† husband and kids were surfing all day while I was relaxing at the beach or at my favorite sandwich bar, Montagu.¬†The best holidays ever!"
Tania R,Barcelona,Oct 2016,"Changgu beach is a nice beach, great for surfers. I didn't like it that much because I don't like beaches with black sand"
jackpastora,"Den Bosch, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,"Nice beach with tons of surfers, but the beach itself is not accessible by wheelchair due to steep stairs. It's nice to watch the surfers at sunset from the boardwalk and have a drink or bite at ""old man"" bar. That as sort of an accessible toilet for small wheelchairs."
Ayie Jogankz,169 contributions,Oct 2016,"This place one of the famous beach in bali. Lot of surfers come to this beach. The swell was good for intermediate skilled surfers (better with longboard). Lot of options for food around, easy parking, good atmosphere, just buy crowded (it's nothing compares to kuta bali)."
Ramses Sinaga,"Bogor, Indonesia",Oct 2016,Canggu beach is a nice view to spent time with especially during sunset. If you bring car or bike there is parking fee (bike RP2000) and so many dogs around belong to local mostly.
Nagwa H,"Doha, Qatar",Mar 2016,we enjoyed the days at canggu beach.. when thirsty or hungry you can always get what you need from the small bars at the top... you can make deals with them and maybe get your sunbed at a low price.
Olivia M,2 contributions,Sep 2016,"Avoid Canggu at all costs... swamped with trash of the smelly human variety and litter! The beach is revolting. If you want to surf you have to fight for waves and wait along with the hundreds of other wannabe surfers who have no sense of surf etiquette.  The town is revolting, equally filthy and swamped with human trash attempting to ride as many scooters as possible.  Most of the restaurants are talented at serving bland mundane food geared to the trash who temporarily inhabit the area in droves. Loud music thumps during the night and in the early mornings you are treated to further thumping and commands being shouted from the moronic gym instructors.."
Rossie m,3 contributions,Sep 2016,Went to eco beach and then canggu and I personally like more this one as im not a pro sufer but can do my tricks
daniela c,"London, UK",Sep 2016,"People say it's the place beach to surf. You can also just relax if you want to and get a sun bed for 20/25k, negotiate always! Loads of spots that you can rent a surf board and get a teacher if you're interested in learning how to surf."
delta52015,"Senggigi, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"New happening beach in Bali, refreshing and different just hope it won't as traffic jam like going to Kuta, Beach"
dee24malang,"Malang, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"Nice beach. Away from hussle and bussle of Seminyak, Kute, and Legian beach. Quiet enough to let us enjoy a true beach environment where people are there to relax, surfing, and take their dogs (there are somehow a lot of people with dogs) to play there. Definitely not many overdressed people go there just to take selfie on every possible angle and spot. Developed enough that there are quite a lot of nice cafes around."
Stacey C,"Victoria, Australia",Sep 2016,What a place to kick back have a few drinks and watch the sun set....beautiful a little out of the way hidden spot we came across from friends who frequent here often as they live close by. Hidden little wonders of the world üëç
Melbournetown01,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"The place is beautiful lovely village feel and quirky stuff happening all around. Because it is being developed its not quite at the standards of Seminyak etc.. I found out the hard way walking on a footpath that had a drain cover taken off, it was pitch black about 9pm, no street lights or other lightning.. We thought it safer on the footpath than the road, fell straight down the drain.  Oops. This was in the main rod down to the beach. Get a taxi."
HDLBruxelles,"Ohaupo, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"Cool and simple area. No pretention when you compare with seminyak. Nice spot to surf, budget restaurant and hotel. Nice sunsets maybe gorgeous finally"
ENES86,Idaho,Sep 2016,This is a black sand beach that is not looked after. The beaches here are a lot more local so there's no resort picking up the trash. The waves are amazing but don't expect to walk along a pristine beach.
Alessandro F,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"I love this beach, i was go every days with my family, i only ask to peoples there to really take care about garbage and not burn the garbage any where is the area is toxic!!"
chitra w,12 contributions,Jun 2016,Many tourists come here for surfing. Not crowded with people. Good place to enjoy the sun set and evening in peace.
Radita K,71 contributions,Aug 2016,"This beach way much more better than Kuta. Less crowded and more perfect in my opinion to chill, lie in the sand, surfing. Plus you will find so many stalls that sell cheap beers, bbq corn, and meatballs. so many dogs here too, but they are so friendly, so no worries!"
Mylittleglitterbugs,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2016,Canguu is like this hidden gem and up and coming hippie /surfer heaven. The beach is safe and fun for kids. The afternoon is better when tide is out. Lots of really authentic and unique restaurants. Can easily park the car or get dropped in taxi and walk around. Lots it see and do. Amazing sunsets from beach bar with a Pina colada 2 for 1 at 5pm. Gets busy for sunset so arrive with plenty of time. 
423djt,brizzy,Jul 2016,This is a better beach than Kuta. The view is magnificent. Not suitable for people looking for crowd.
Marc Derveeuw,"Maseru, Lesotho",Aug 2016,"Popular beach but the place only developed in the past two years, a few access roads and there are still hidden beaches around. Mostly black sand beaches,"
sflsenglish,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Aug 2016,"Canggu Beach is like a contradiction. It should be a quiet beach, it is described as a quiet beach. So lots of people holidaying in the busier resorts go to the quiet beach of Canggu, which means it is not a quiet beach.Canggu seems popular with younger people who want to enjoy the surf and lounging on the beach, there isn't much else to do there.Take a walk towards Batubelig and Seminyak and you will find some fishermen's huts with some neat Banksy style artwork.There is a nice temple complex adjacent to the car park and the area is being renovated quite neatly.Canggu looks as though it's going to be the next add-on to the already overcrowded ""popular"" tourist resorts, so it's worth visiting before the developers ruin it.Walk about 200 meters along the road away from the beach and find Warung Ithaka, an excellent fusion type cafe."
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2016,A great spot for relaxing. Loads of young people surfing or doing yoga nearby. Great Cafes near by serving healthy options. Like Bali was many years ago. Interesting access to get to Canggu Beach. Loved staying here..
QuickWhitTravel,"Washington DC, DC",Aug 2016,"This is a good beach to learn to surf or just lay out and enjoy the Indian Ocean. My husband and I took a stroll and laid out for a while here. Watch out for syringes (which is why I give this beach a 3 out of 5) and the like, but it's a pretty nice beach otherwise. "
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Aug 2016,Canggu beach is much more relaxed then neighbour Seminyak and still has the surfers vibe. Just off the beach there are several nice bars and restaurants.
Perception1111,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Aug 2016,Great beach for kids to come hang around / make sand castles / fly a kite and just hang around. Just next to where we live and it is a great weekend spot. 
lio69005,"Lyon, France",Aug 2016,"The beach is really cool to surf, even if you should take waves ""far away from the beach"" .Small waves are ok for beginners, but not too young !Surfboards renters are on the parking closed to the beach (50000rph for 2h or 100000 for the day)"
womblewa,"Mandurah, Australia",Aug 2016,"If you like Queensland or WA soft white sand with a pristine and developed shore line, then this is about as far from that as you can get.  Black sand, horse riding, fishing and surfing on a rough undeveloped (hallelujah!!) beach with some great cafe shacks up by the Echo Beach end.  We thought this was lovely.  Minimal rubbish, wild beauty.  Not the Bali of the tourism photos, and hardly any of the tourists (other than surfers) either. "
BastijnvdBoom,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,"Beautiful beach with lots of bars, restaurants, and lounge opportunities. There are some nice walks along the beach which can be hard during high tide, but just follow the water and enjoy all the people and views. You can find beautiful shells and swim almost everywhere. Also, lot of waves perfect for surfing with enough locals renting boards and even giving lessons. Some street dogs are living on the beach but they are very happy, enjoying themselves without bothering you. If you arrive by scooter, you might have to pay 2.000 entrance fee."
herandherdog,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"We walked along Canggu beach because we couldn't get a seat at Finns beach club. It was a blessing in disguise because we had a great time swimming in the ocean. There are lots of surfers and boogie borders. The waves were pretty rough but you could remain in the shallow and pretty much just play in the waves (which were strong) Don't wear a bikini because your bottoms will get pulled off, but you'll have time to grab them ;) the waves are a bit rough if you small children. We walked about 500m away from Finns and found a quiet spot where the sand was clean and it was like our own private beach. The water is clear and clean. We didn't have towels because we assumed we could get some at Finns and ended up just sitting on the fine sand and were fine without them. There are small huts along the beach where you can get a drink and hire a bean bag if you like. Canggu beach is stunning! "
vanessalsl,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"Definitely a good place to hang out when in Bali. From deus gallery to beach clubs and echo n old man's, a weekend is easily spent with the awesome vibe canggu gives"
Donna T,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"More of a volcanic sand rather than your nice white soft sand. Very strong waves so more suitable for surfers, Bit of rubbish on the sand too."
erasmusgrad,"Durham, NC",Aug 2016,"Beach near our villa in Canggu. Great spot for surfers and photo taking. Chilled at a surfside cafe for a light lunch, watching the waves. Relax and enjoy! "
threegirlsgo,"Menlo Park, CA",Jul 2016,"Came to this beach 4 days in a row. Not too crowded, plenty of beach chairs to rent (50K IDR for two), inexpensively priced cold beers and drinks, and occasionally two vendors selling chicken satay and roasted corn on the cob (15K for satay, 10K for corn). Lots of beginning surfers, taking their 10 min lesson and then heading for the water with their instructors. We had Putu (sp?) who was fantastic with the kids. Dragged them out to sea, launched them on selected waves, and let them go. They were able to stand up, each of them, several times, and came back declaring that they loved surfing. Not all instructors were as hard working and diligent as he, so ask for him if you can. He's usually in the last surf hut on the left of the little strip of huts to the right of the temple (his is closest to the temple). Standard rate is 350K for 2 hours. The number and quality of waves is great for beginners, and the water is pretty shallow for those who just want to play. But there are plenty of waves that can be a bit strong, so maybe not so great for very small children. The beach itself slopes down at an angle, which is perfect for getting a good view of all the surfers from the comfort of your padded lounge chair. "
Allan B,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"Surf in the morning and if you are there in July or August, kitesurf in the afternoon. On a big day the waves are head an a half, peeling nicely.There are some good restaurants and cafes near the beach for recharging after a good session"
Guillaume L,"Montreal, Canada",Jul 2016,Great playa. Great to learn surf.Black send and cool waves. We had a lot of fun in the morning hour.
ShannaSharon,"Antwerp Province, Belgium",Jul 2016,"It's so crowded for surfing, even when you get out at first light. And when it gets crowded it gets competitive. I had more fun at other breaks and the beach isn't so beautiful either."
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"One of the great beaches views in Bali. Especially for surfer who like challenges to fight with wind and wave, this place is the right one for you. Mostly foreigners there, drying their body by laying down along the beach. Seen local people played huge kites flying in the water with surfing board."
HansK774,"Boskoop, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,As Semanyak had become more busy Bali lovers know to find Canggu and its beach.Also Canggu gets busier as we compare through the years but that leads also to more bars and restaurants.Not only for surf folks but beach lovers van make long walks.
George V,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Really enjoyed this beach. Did surf lessons (ask for Peris) with my 8yr old girl and also body surfing. Note this is a real surf beach and not for toddlers or weak swimmers.Great surf scene best in Bali.
Thewillys10,Papamoa Beach,Jul 2016,All I can say is it is magic! Gotta visit this place and enjoy the amazing sunset!! Great little spots along the beach to enjoy drinks and meals at very cheap prices! 
Pado P,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"First time to cangguNO NEED TO PAY ENTRACEYou just have to pay parking fee at IDR 5.000 for car and IDR 2.000 for motor, shower IDR 5.000/person, toilet IDR 2.000/personCoconut only IDR 15.000Surf lesson around IDR 200.000 a 350.000 depend how good you negotiateNo sellers force you to buy thingsHope this clean peace beach will longlast"
Chlotier,"London, UK",Jun 2016,"Went here for the day on a trip with family, was recommended by one of the locals and was brilliant. There is a massive bar/hut where you can chill and directly opposite is a surf school that allows you to rent a board for ¬£15 for an hour and a half. I had IMAN TAUFIK and was so impressed with his tuition, he was really encouraging and I picked it up quickly. Very unspoilt and beautiful, the sea is great for surfing as the sea bed is just pure sand."
Sophie,"Wodonga, Australia",Jul 2016,"Unless you are a surfer or a stray dog Canggu beach doesn't have much to offer. The sand is polluted with constant rubbish and I didn't feel comfortable walking with bare feet. We used the Canggu Beach front as a quick path to get from Canggu (where our villa was) to Echo Beach. Canggu beach also seems to be a popular hangout spot for stray dogs, they never caused us any issues though (other than there mess). "
Andresguia,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Canggu beach is my favorite beach as it is only 3 km or so from my house and from my childhood I with my friends we used to go there to enjoy the long black sandy beach to be our playground. Today it still has the magic but not more a quiet fishing village like before. Now sprung so many restaurants and cafes and shops and motorbike rentals and money changers along the way to the beach. Sometimes it is very difficult to find a parking space near the beach and there is a parking cost now. If you look for serenity, avoid coming on weekends when it is crowded with all food charts selling local delicacies to locals coming to swim in the shallow waters or to sit down and see the world goes by eating your grilled corn or chopped spring rolls or having your meat balls soup on the beach with your loved ones. The black sundy beach is nice and it is a long beach with big waves for surfers."
Jessi S,"Bellingen, Australia",Jun 2016,Simple town.. for now. developing rapidly. Great views of ocean and surf. Old mans bar is too easy to roll into after a day on beach. Sleepy town away from busyiness. 
Jess K,"Nagambie, Australia",Jun 2016,"I really enjoy going to this beach, it's a lot less 'touristy' than Seminyak, Legian, Kuta. The surf is great even if it can get a bit packed out on the waves. There's heaps of little local warung a selling cheap food, coconuts and cold beers. All very nice and casual the way Bali used to be a long time ago."
FrequentFlier651216,3 contributions,Jun 2016,"Canggu has been my first stop in Bali so far and from what I read this is supposed to be less crowded than other areas. The first day I was here I counted 120 surfers at old man's and everyone dropping in on each other. Really crowded line ups.Local surf instructors will literally push their customers into your path on the wave (and into each other. I seen one student get her nose split open, was inevitable). This place is super busy.Down at echo seems a little less crowded but expect 15 - 30 on each peak. Despite this, it has some really nice peaks. There is a really nice left outside echo beach club which doesn't seem to get as crowded as everywhere else.There are plenty of Warungs and the quality of food is very good and very reasonably priced but expect to pay more than areas away from the beach.Beach itself can be dirty in spots and be careful when walking the beaches. There was plenty of broken bottles on the way from old man's heading south to Berewa. "
Isabella K,20 contributions,Jun 2016,"beginners often start their surf career at this beach. sunset really amazing. More warungs, old man's close and many ladies selling sarong and bracelettes. "
Maria J,"Mississauga, Canada",Dec 2015,"If you want to stay off the beaten path and away from many tourists during the holidays, Canggu Beach was perfect. There were enough hotels ranging from 3-5 stars that you could easily find one within your budget.  We were able to find a mix of authentic Bali eats, things to do and get our photo ops in while at the same time, be minutes from luxury. "
Fuseek,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,Just another beach. There's a toll guy just before you hit the sand (or tourist scammer depends on your perspective) the hotel that adjacent to the entry is enormous but very cool hit design and looks amazing inside.
ankita_petiwale,"Mumbai, India",May 2016,The Batu Bolong area on Canguu beach is very lively and lined with good cafes! You can meet interesting people and have conversations over food! 
Vany V,15 contributions,May 2016,"For surfers, Canggu beach has tides that last long. The currents pull you out very quickly, and it would be very tiring to go back, but it was a nice experience with nice people! "
Maria S,"Markham, Canada",May 2016,"Canggu beach is a very beautiful yet quite beach.. It took a about 45 minutes to reach from Kuta beach due to the heavy traffic. Once you are there, its really different from Kuta beach which is sometimes over crowded..unfortunately it has black sands. Its now have some restaurant and coffee shop . Its good  to visit before it gets over crowded"
cdv2015,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,We spent an easygoing afternoon enjoy the place. Many surfers are practising which offers a very pleasant attraction all over the day.
Acebeer,"Cape Town, South Africa",May 2016,"Enjoyed the surf so hanged around for a week or so. It is not Kuta (which is awesome). It is my kind of place, but can see how others might not agree."
seb levaillant,"Paris, France",Apr 2016,Great spot to drink a beer while watching sunsets and surfers! Sometimes too many dogs hanging on the beach but they dont cause much troubles.
andokelli,"Launceston, Australia",May 2015,"Nice beach, but typical for a lot of Indo has a fair bit of rubbish. Good surf spot, probably better for intermediates upwards as it can get crazy. Good bars, cafes and restaurants within walking distance"
Robert M,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Apr 2016,Great beach for a visit. Surf variable to suit all tastes. Some attention from hawkers but  responded to firm response. Food and drink readily available. Pleasant day out. 
Lauren H,"Indianapolis, IN",Apr 2016,"This was my favorite beach on this coast. Very laid back vibes. Great waves, atmosphere, and beach bars. I would've loved to spend more time at this beach!"
Mary,"Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand",Mar 2016,"I spent a sunset here on my own, I felt safe. What I liked was that there were so many locals enjoying the last of the sun and the beach. I sat and had a coke and soaked it all in."
Maya L,9 contributions,Apr 2016,"Nice place for bring friends here and nice cafe arrounds make us easy  if hungry and find some food here ,will come here again"
Maria Z,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,It's a bit hard to get there from Seminyak but it's worth the trek. The taxis have a hard time getting there because the sneaky shortcut to get in is usually patrolled by police ( should be one way only) So in order to get there from Seminyak its a good 20 minute cab ride. Seems the surfers love it and the ambiance of the area is very surfer cool. No tourist busses here. Phew!The sand is dark (volcanic) and the swimming is a bit risky ( lots of currents) however OLD MANS pub is a super cool place to get some food and cold beers and watch the surf. Occasionally there are street markets in the car park and there's live music most nights at OLD MANS.An up and coming part of South bali and worth the visit
DaveR,"Como, Australia",Apr 2016,"We walked along this morning from Ecco up to Legian. Definately a lovely beach to stroll along, especially early in the morning when not too hot. Watch out for some of the waves that thump their way in, and try to knock you over. Able to swim here and yes it is super refreshing , do watch the currents though, very strong. Kids need to be closely watched before they float away. Water is nice and clean.  A great place to get lessons for surfing or if you have mastered it...go nuts, amazing action out there."
artys_facts,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,This beach is the best place to build your surfing confidence. There are plenty of businesses on and close to the beach to get an advise or a guide person or simply rent a surf board of your like. Beginners can start with a soft board and move to use a hard board next day under the supervision of a local surfing guide/instructor. Most of the guides are great and you can book them day after day if you liked the way they look after you. The beach is better for surfing than having a bath with kids as the waves seem to never stop.
layaputhih,8 contributions,Dec 2015,"The local charge us when we get in, its normal, but the local community should do something for cleaning. You can see many rubbish on this beautiful beach. Its a pity that it cant be clean"
Juan P,"San Fernando, Buenos aires, Argentina",Mar 2016,"the best place to surf, excellent, much better than kutta. It's a dream place. I want to come back ."
Douglas C,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2016,"That seems like a self-promoting axiom, but it is true. Canggu is where Bali gets its reputation as a surf capital in Asia. Yes, Uluwatu has much bigger swells, upwards of 25 feet, but Canggu is where the locals really know how to surf and where they spend a good deal of time.This is a great, non-crowded beach. It has about four to seven Warungs on the beachside, depending on how you are counting. It has a few big restaurants near the rocks, at the end of the road. And it's filled with everyone from locals to Europeans, to Americans to Australians. And there are even the occasional bare-breasted ladies who think it's cool to go au natural in one of the more conservative cultures in Asia. The people are friendly. For the most part the beach is clean. Yes, you see dogs around, but then if you don't see dogs, you are not on a SE Asia beach.There are also cows. Lots of cows. Even cute baby cows every rainy season who like to frolic and gambol in the sand. Respect them. They are very nice cows."
JoyHua,London,Mar 2016,If you're there for the surf and crave a long left hander than I'm sure you'll find plenty to love about Canggu beach but as a beach to relax on I'm sure that Bali can offer better. Worst of all is the shocking amount of plastic littered on the beach. During a storm I watched  a drain open up and so much rubbish rushing towards the ocean that I was compelled to pick up as much as I could and put in the trash. Not one other person joined me. A local thanked me but still the ocean is life and we should be doing more to protect it.
Kristina S,7 contributions,Jan 2016,"Canggu is such an amazing gem- bustling with cafe's, great eats and people- behind it's seemingly countryside look. You will be walking along encountering cows and local farmlife- and next minute you stumble across small cafes and restaurants and will be served the meal of your life. We extended our stay there- ditched other destinations, came back before leaving- and even contempleted extending our flight home- just because we were so smitten with Canggu"
Pinay Nomad,"New Orleans, LA",Mar 2016,"I went here 3 times for sunset. I like watching the surfers and the dogs running around like kids. It made me miss my pets so much. I recommend this place for anyone who will be visiting North Kuta, Bali. Best time to come during sunset"
SJW2,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Much quieter than other beaches in the area, authentic bars and restaurants waters pretty rough but fun sand is black we enjoyed the day there "
Matilda M,"Manly, Australia",Mar 2016,"If you can handle big surf or you just want to catch some rays on a beach chair near the ocean, Canggu beach is your spot. Grab a beach chair with umbrella for 30,000IDR/person - just be aware of the tides as they might wash you away!"
Mariahahansen,"Rohnert Park, CA",Mar 2016,Lots of walking up and down the beach with my 5 year old. Not a great swimming beach but very fun and entertaining nonetheless. Didn't like seeing all the trash but was inspired by two non-Balinese people spending their day picking up trash along the beachfront. Tons of surfers enjoying waves but also quiet places to hang and watch the ocean. Particularly beautiful at sunset. Early in the am we could see cows walking the beach from our villa. 
Mrskussy,"Agnes Water, Australia",Mar 2016,"After 10 visits to Bali was time to try a different area other than Nusa dua, Sanur, legian, Tuban or ubud.... What we loved - the village atmosphere, the lack of shopping ( a few small fine boutiques though ), the no hawkers, the quiet, the choice of accommodation, the OUTSTANDING restaurants at a reasonable price, the long beach walks, safely zipping around on a scooter, the live music, the day spa, watching the surfers. 8 days was really only just enough. What we didn't love - being only a handful of people over 30 and the odd ones out - great for the young ones in their 20/30s. Will tell my daughter about it LOL Despite this, I am sure we will be back as I liked it way more than legian and Tuban."
Jitske J,"Groningen, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"I heard the most amazing things about Canggu before I went there so I had high expectations but looking back I feel like I wasted my time going there. I spend 3 days there, 3 days too much. The beach was a big disappointment. Not a good place for sunbathing or swimming (or snorkeling). Just only for surfing. I had expected a relaxing feel to the place and nice bars and restaurants just next to the beach, like in Seminyak, but this wasn't the case. There were some facilities but a bit far from the sea and the restaurants more close to it had very uncomfortable seats and didn't feel cozy at all. I would not go here again."
Viczenden,"Victoria, Canada",Jan 2016,I came here for an afternoon to see the beach.  Glad I came!  it was quiet that day but VERY HOT!  I ate a local restaurant afterwards and then went back and watched the sunset:)
dean c,"Eaton, Australia",Mar 2016,"If ur not into Surfing I wouldn't plan a big stay up here.. the waves are good, theres plenty of nice rest around..But the beach is black, rocky and not suited for swimming..."
Suzanne C C,"Nelson Bay, Australia",Feb 2016,"I rode my scooter down to the beach, and I'm glad I did, because from the beach end of  Jl. Batu Bolong, it's easy to ride along near the beach front to Echo Beach, which is further north. When you arrive at the beach, there is a hive of activity, as there are many surf schools, and learner as well as experienced surfers. There are also many warungs, and a huge favourite 'hangout' bar/cafe named 'Old Man's', right at the end of the road on the beachfront.  It has fantastic food, starting early for breakfast, right through the evening. Old Man's also has surfboard racks, and outdoor shower, toilets and change rooms.  Very easy access and great facilities!  "
Robbert,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"good place to start surfing, less crowded than echo beach and still a good surf. rent a board and take a lesson if needed"
864greyghost22,"Boise, ID",Jan 2016,The most amazing sunset you'll ever see. Travel by scooter is best and very accessible to rent and it's cheap too.
66kombivan,"Bundoora, Australia",Jan 2016,"Rooftop breakfast overlooking the surf, grab your board, 10 minute stroll to ""Old mans'"" beach, small warung selling wax, cold drinks and board hire and a shower to wash off the salt. Sleep, eat, repeat!"
Eg007,"Bennebroek, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"The sand is black but the waves, the wadungs  and cafes are great. We were here during the rain season and loved every moment. it's a lot cleaner then Seminyak beach and the waves are better."
Dominika F,"Prague, Czech Republic",Nov 2015,"Surfing, sea, waves, what else do you need to have the perfect time? Plus, they rent surfs and sell beer everywhere :)"
Firsta,Indonesia,Jan 2016,"This beach (I think it is called Batu Bolong Beach not Canggu Beach) is a great place to hang out close to sunset time. It is also a spot for surfing. There is not much happening, just several chairs and umbrellas (plus several local ladies selling bracelets and saroongs), and people surfing, but this is probably why this beach is great to visit. You can go to Old's man if you want a more lively ambiance."
emzeperx,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jan 2016,"This section of the beach is not well maintained, litter around just like at most places. Does not offer any services, except for the surf rental."
LittleNickyA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,A great beach any time of day but particularly beautiful at sunset. Plenty of places to buy food and drinks along the beach and sit back and take in the view
David R,France,Dec 2015,Much better than the vibrant Kuta and Seminyak beaches.Batu Bolong is very attractive road and retains the spirit of Bali.
Franzi B,"Leipzig, Germany",Sep 2015,If you are on bali you need to go to canggu. It's my most favourite place ever. Beaches are awesome and good surfing vibes everywhere.
LIVETOTRAVEL8,"Burpengary, Australia",Jan 2016,beach has hawkers. vendors with drinks. waves. beds and umbrellas. for hire. a temple. a busy bar full of backpacker types. clean beach to swim in. 
David R,Sydney,Jan 2016,Great surf beach with easy access and a variety of offerings for food and drinks around.The beach vendors are super cheap and everything is relaxed. 
Ellemay üçπüê†üê≥,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"We were staying down the road at Berawa Beach & decided to drive up to Canggu to watch the surf & sunset. The surf is excellent for board riders however for swimming it was a little dangerous as the surf was pretty big. We preferred Berawa Beach for swimming. The sand is black which is hard to adjust to after our gorgeous beaches in Sydney. Canggu is much quieter than busy Seminyak or Kuta however it will probably change soon as there is a lot of development happening around the area which is a shame as the area is lovely with still some rice paddies & local village communities. Overall - Fabulous surfing beach, black sand, good cafes & restaurants , interesting shopping & overall peaceful area of Bali."
lillypilly72,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Echo beach is a great surfing beach with large waves.It has volcanic sand and just before many restaurants overlooking the beach,nice to watch the waves whilst sipping on a cocktail."
happylinch,468 contributions,Jan 2016,It isvery difficult to find this beach as many private properties had closed the access and after we find it the beach is not beautiful. It is totally not worth the ride
harwhat_79,"Isle of Wight, UK",Jan 2016,"Only for the waves, you'd go.Black hot sand, beaches littered with all types of rubbish & plastics. Bali needs to act now ! "
LinaSuraini,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,One of the beaches that are not full of tourists. Not sure if it usually is but it was empty when we came around 2pm in December. There were a couple of guys surfing though. Definitely for those who prefer to get away from the popular hot spots and have a relaxing and peaceful time here. 
mi2foodie,20 contributions,Dec 2015,"Canggu has it all: great restaurants, good beaches, and loads of activities for all to enjoy. Super chill place"
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Dec 2015,A great place to visit especially if you are into surfing. It an be a difficult break to surf but great for the experienced. Over the years it is becoming more and more popular so I would suggest costing now before it becomes like Uluwatu and Kuta. Lots of warungs and cafes around to eat and have coffe. As I said. It is getting popular so go now 
Ryan R,Barbados,Dec 2015,"If you're in the Canggu area and looking to try surfing, this is a good beach to check out. If youre more into looking at the sufer guys and gals while sipping on a coconut and catching some rays, this is also a good beach to check out."
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Completed first ever surfing lesson on this beach in Canggu. Surf instructor Desu from Desu de Bali Surf School drove to this long reef break. Plenty of boards for hire at beach, food, drinks and shower available and nice drive through rice fields of Canggu on way."
pamelandfred,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Feb 2015,"Really nice beach, relatively clean with black lava sand and big volcanic rocks.My husband surfed here and I took pics"
crazybulie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2015,Canggu Beach has become the new little Kuta with over development by westerners. The reef breaks give  nice long ride and Caf√© Canggu always is a great place for food and a drink.For those more into night life old mans is a great place. For those seeking traditional Bali it has left Canggu.
Civetfan,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,"The first time I went to Canggu was in June 2014. It was then still relatively quiet beach (I visited Batu Bolong), especially if you compare with Kuta. I fell in love with Canggu and longed to get back. Now, being back a couple of times I start to see more clearly and I have adjusted my opinion about Canggu.Canggu is used to be covered by abundance rice fields and limitless coconut trees at her beaches, the saying goes. But now it is becoming, pitifully, more and more like her oldest sisters, Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Here and there you can see pieces of rice fields, but villa's at various styles and sizes are becoming the dominant landscape. Surfers come for all over the world to use this place as their playground. Cafe's and Bar, all made to fit the western styles, are in abundance. I do not get this. If you are on holiday in exotic country, why on earth you want to have croissant with bacon for breakfast, mozzarella salad for lunch and spare ribs for dinner? Try nasi bungkus instead at local waroeng for ‚Ç¨ 0.4 ( Rp. 5.000). Try kopi tubruk (Balinese coffee) instead of espresso. And ask for a bike for transportation, instead of a motorcycle. Perhaps by doing this there is a vain hope that the damage is a little less than worst.The mass tourism, wherein I, myself, also participate, has contributed to the loss of more and more rice fields or to put it more critically, the loss of Balinese' authenticity and its nature.  How ironic the fate of Balinese. Thousand of years ago they run away from the influence of Islam by sailing from Java to be able to preserve its culture, only to be now slowly destroyed by mass tourism. This time, sadly, there is no escape for Balinese."
topdogpete,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2015,"Uncrowded beach with food, drinks and restaurants. Coolest surf beach. Reasonably safe for swimming."
heidiwho,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2015,Spent a few mornings here having a surf followed by a coconut water in a local warung. Loved seeing the locals going about daily life.
keehk,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",Nov 2015,"This Beach is only good for Surfers. Its mostly crowded but have good waves. And chill an the ""Old Man's"" Bar."
Sarah n Pete R,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"We took an afternoon to visit this beach and watch the sunset, it is a very simple beach with a few stalls  to buy take away food or some very basic places to buy a beer, sunset was great to watch from this spot."
Sapper786,"Kambalda, Australia",Oct 2015,"Beautiful sunsets , great bars and warungs.Quiet and relaxing .Great surf .The local traders are fantastics and friendly."
Zac,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,Beautiful beach for the family to visit. Definitely a must-do if you are near the area. Great place for drinks.
LefrogPerth,Perth,Oct 2015,"Canggu beach is for surfers, black volcanic beach, close to Echo Beach, not much shade except for the hire beach umbrellas available"
Skydiver222,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Canggu beach is a nice laid back beach to visit. If you are looking to try out surfing, here you find it at affordable price. Can rent a board for as cheap as USD3.00. Lessons vary per price but can negotiate for about 20-30usd. The waves are low enough.  A great don't you catch the beautiful Balinese sunset and enjoy a refreshing drink.  "
geelongexpat,"Chatan-cho, Japan",Oct 2015,"I spent this afternoon at Canggu Beach. It is a fabulous little beach where for 30000 IDR you can chill under a beach umbrella. Hardly any touts sell in this area either. There are several surf schools as well so you can watch everyone try to surf too. The current is very strong for swimmers so be prepared to fall over a few times wading out into the ocean. If you head south towards Seminyak, you will also find some nice areas of the beach that don't have any tourists on them."
JosephineSalvador,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Aug 2015,Canggu beach is quieter than other  beaches which is lovely. It has a large stretch of darker sand and has plenty of beachside cafes and restaurants. The waves are too high for a beginner but good for intermediate surfers.
Chris,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2015,"Lovely little place to watch surfers in the water, waiting for the waves. In the shadows of a parasol at a vendor stand, hold on to your cold bintang and watch the waves break on the big rock. Relaxed surfers vibe."
trecev,"Manila, Philippines",Sep 2015,"Nice, chill place. Lot's of options to eat and drink. Food stalls for grilled corn and fresh coconut. For drinks and cool music, there's Old Man's"

Sean E,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Canggu Beach is an awesome beach with a massive surf.Be careful if you have kids as it's pretty huge!The beach sand is dark due to the volcanic area.
ecutting2,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2015,This beach has great surf . Much quieter beach than Kuta and not hassled to buy from the locals. Right next door to echo beach with beachside eateries. Fantastic sunsets. Great place to get away from the hussle and bustle.
petter111,"Berlin, Germany",Sep 2015,Nice place to learn how to surf. Decent rates on surfboard rental and lessons. Nice bar/restaurants close to the beach.
Peter H,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"amazing spot especially for sureferts , great food and service - a must see spot that is still nice and quiet and away from the hustle and bustle of kuta or seminyak"

cicc0,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Sand is course and very dirty.Poorly maintained Shore.Restuarants and small retail shops remind me of Anglesea,Torquay & Ocean Grove etc over 30 years ago.Tourists incur Charges for Car Parking."
Melanie B,17 contributions,Aug 2015,"Canggu is great for surfing and its absolutely the hipster part from bali. More chillout and the evenings are quite, not many parties over there. A good break after the busy and super touristic kuta."
Jenny D,"Mona Vale, Australia",Aug 2015,"As my other half was unable to surf this year (injuries) and we had already booked, I was dubious about Canggu this time. We swam each morning early - the beach is black sand and typical of Bali. However it was refreshing and challenging at times with the shore break - but doable. We were the only swimmers amongst the surfers!"
Ubud Village To... K,70 contributions,Aug 2015,If you like surfing in Bali you can tray coming to Canggu beach.that is one of beach in Bali very good for surfing because the wake for good end hige.besiade of that the area more kwayet then other beach.very nice
DrVLee,"Philadelphia, PA",Aug 2015,Very scenic with great surfing! Lot's of young people as well as families on the beach. Easy to get to with great food options in the nearby neighborhood to reload.
Federico O,"Ponte San Nicolo, Italy",Jun 2015,"It's been a wonderful vacation in a surfhouse close to the beach, that is perfect for surfing and for a family with lillte children who wants to enjoy the beach life (playing with sand and so on). Unfortunately one of the last day someone stole our camera right in the middle of the beach when we were playing in the water... So keep your eyes open!!"
sat_owl,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"Excellent place to surf, but not for swimming. Large abandoned hotel near the beach makes the place great for hangout and scenic photography."
YK Ng,"Munich, Germany",Jun 2015,"Stopped by at this beach during noon time on a working day. it was quiet place except the sound of big sea wave washing the beach. There were about 2 dozen of people enjoying their surfing, and a couple riding horse and their camera man taking wedding photos. The beach is pretty nice. Wave is strong so may not be suitable for swimming, except those going for surfing."
Rebecca M,"Banbury, UK",Sep 2014,"This is the first village we stayed in  when we very first came to Bali in1996. Since that time we have visited eleven times more. We have God children there and consider the island and the folk wr have come to know and trust there our second home.Canggu beach was a favourite spot of mine and grew on mevthe more I saw if it with every subsequent visit. There was a time when we didn't visit Bali as we do have other places to see in the world and after another 43 countries we returned. Canggu was no longer the lovely place we remember. It has changed for the worst to becoming a silly surfer's hangout, there us a place there now that has been named Echo beach....what???? Dear me where do these airheads come from?? The beach still holds its charm in some places but had become some sort of pretentious bimbo retreat with really silly youngsters trying to outdo one another on the surf stakes. Unfortunately for Canggu this has spoilt its natural appeal. It's still a remarkable beach along some parts but is declining into a total tourist trap with all the usual restaurants ,coffee places and  bars, God help us it looks as if its on its way to becoming Kuta..Still has beautiful black sand and fantastic surf....lets hope it doesn't get any worse..."
Nadan06,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Canggu beach is great to hang at echo beach cafes, then hit the surf or lay on the beach, renting a sun lounge and drinking juices etc"
JuanLonelyTraveller,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2015,"A bit overrated, the surf was nice and the place was popular with europeans. A lot of beach sellers selling bracelets and offering massages which can be a bit annoying. It smelt funny so we only stayed for a swim."
Wisnu Utomo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"The beach is actually not too special, but if you are looking for a different atmosphere, and already bored with the beaches of Seminyak, Kuta what else .... So the beach is very suitable to be a distraction :)One with a swampy coastline and echo beach."
Robert E,"Lviv, Ukraine",Jul 2015,"We hired scooters and took the drive up the coast to enjoy some beach that was far less crowded and we enjoyed a good surf and relax on the beach, would really recommend this for travellers"
MargaretTMS,"Glasgow, UK",Jun 2015,Great surfing beachLocal folk have stalls along side selling food and wares.Very busy both with tourists and localsLots of debris and litter tho 
Jeremy F,"Constantia, South Africa",Jul 2015,"The beach has three or four great surf spots and also has some nice bars to hang out at. The problem is the beach has dirty black sand and there are strong currents that are not great for swimming in. Water quality has been questionable in some reports to, people getting sick from it. "
Avi G,"Carlsbad, California, United States",Jul 2015,A wide selection of reefs and breaks that allow you to get the most out of your trip away from Kuta.  A good community of restaurants and proximity to Seminyak for a little city life make Canggu a great region to explore.
amraldo,"Canberra, Australia",Jul 2015,Fun beach and surf vibe with lots of great healthy cafes for post surf snacks. Old man's is good for happy hour also and has a nice market once a fortnight/month (not sure exactly how frequent :-)
Ashan1991,"Byron Bay, Australia",Mar 2015,I liked easy take off fun wall .too many people in the water disliked the dogs every where but that's life
Sherry G,17 contributions,Jun 2015,"Great hip beach. Excellent eats, nice sandy beaches with opportunity to rent surf boards. Try the young cocnuts; refreshing and cheap."
chris cat,"Palm Beach, FL",Aug 2014,"Very beautiful, very clean. Mostly a locals spot which is what i loved about it. Cheap rentals if you don't need the nightlife and bars and such. About a 20 minute scooter ride from Kuta. Great surfing but there can be a mean undertow so be careful. Take a local guide - they are cheap and very knowledgeable."
Mici0303,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Apr 2015,"This beach is settled only 30 minutes drive from crowded Kuta and is a good place for relaxed days at the beach or even for catching some good waves. There are enough spots where you can rent a surf or hire a ""surf instructor"", there are some bars and places where you can get a snack.  Along the Canggu beach you can find several good places to stay, villas and other accomodation fascilities with swimming pools, even walking distance from the ocean. "
Max274967,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"It's nice to go a bit further north to Canggu for some hassle free waves and a much nicer environment than the beaches further south. There is also a great market set up on a Sunday where there is a bar and a restaurant, all in all it is a lovely chill out place!"
10connie1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"The boys enjoyed surfing. There are quite a few options of restaurants, to beach side BBQ restaurants to cafesSpa treatments & surf shops"
Christopher555,"Toronto, Canada",Jul 2015,We happened to be staying in Canggu because of a yoga training so we had to see Canggu beach. It is quite dirty and has large waves. Nothing spectacular. I wouldn't recommend driving a far distance to see this beach. At best it is an average beach
bondibubble,Sydney,Dec 2014,I'd sadly stay away from the beach. It's polluted and the surf is not good. It's much better to stay at your villa and enjoy the pool.
Brian K,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,"Canggu's a great place to come for surfing and hanging out, especially at Old Mans bar which has a great vibe and has happy hour from 5-6 everyday. The beach itself is pretty dirty, there's lots of rubbish and dogs everywhere who all use the beach as their toilet so sunbath here at your own risk! There are also lots of good places to eat in the area, especially Betelnut Cafe. Definitely worth a visit for a few days."
Rai Hanah M,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,If you are looking to enjoy a quiet time by the beach and hates going to Kuta ... this is it.  Lots of small cafes that serves good food and the beach is not crowded.
Natees,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2014,"Great surf beach,friendly locals and not too far out from the hustle and bustle in Kuta, well worth the drive/scooter out  to here, would even consider staying here next time in Bali and visiting other places from here."
John M,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015, long open beach good for walks and a couple of beach breaks for surfing. Not for inexperienced swimmers - they are best with a cool drink watching the sunset
cherylmL457TW,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2015,surf beach was great very friendly locals with food on the beach You can enjoy a Bintang on the beach at sunset with all the locals
LinksProperty,Torquay,Jun 2015,"Amazing new water park. Clean and not busy, rides to ourselves. Access to the Club and all the facilities gym. Great day out"
Papillonul,"Timisoara, Romania",Jun 2015,"First contact with a beach in Bali and it was a surfer's beach. Just my luck. So you can go at Batu Bolong Beach for a walk, tan, surf, chillax, but not for a swim that's for sure. I tried 2 times and got hit to the sand by the waves. It's also a bit dirty and not very crowded (in May that is)"
Hungry-mum,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2015,"This is a surfer paradise.I went in for a dip and got hacked about by massive waves, still finding sand in my ears and bikini days later!"

Darwinfoodie2014,"Darwin, Australia",May 2015,Canggu is a haven for Surfing.  Lots of young people hanging out and riding waves.  Families playing on the beach and beautiful sunset.  Lots of local street food vendors and cold beers at Old Mans
Lun2Travel,Canberra,May 2015,"We have been in past years but I think this will be our last trip to this place.  It's now very, very crowded, very dirty and the traffic makes it a nightmare.  We stayed less than a 100 metres from the beach in a lovely villa but we enjoyed our country stays a lot more.  Many sites say Canggu is well placed for shopping in Semiyak or Kuta but it's not - the road system is too crowded to get anywhere quickly or comfortably.  I'd suggest the country - Amed, Candi Desa, Lovina offer much better experiences than Canggu."
Xavier G,"Lindau, Germany",May 2015,"The sand is dark and the beach quite dirty. But perfect for beginner surfers. No long chairs going with bars, you must pay 60 000 rupies for 2h."
Firdaus Alip,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Amazing beach, amazing waves, amazing atmosphere (Old Man's). If you're walking on the rock pools, be sure to put on some form of footwear. I saw a small flower urchin (red and white bristles) while walking. O.o"

Erwin K,"Bandung,Indonesia",Feb 2015,"Visited the Canggu beach near Pura Petitinget on February 2015 , it was a very hot morning.Unlike other reviews here , we found that the Canggu beach was in a nice condition and relatively clean, so we went for a swim, well , maybe the filthy beach was in the different part of Canggu.Great beach for a swim with moderate waves, black sands.Would be great to watch the sunset from here."
Jaya Wisesa,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"First time come to Canggu beach, when i am escort my Japanese friends for surfing. He love it very much, and always come to Bali every years. Especialy to Canggu beach"
SingaporeExpaddy,dublin,Feb 2015,This is a great beach and a good spot to join the locals in the evening for sunset when food stalls pop up.
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"This beach at JL. Batubolong is a great surfing beach but not a safe beach for kids and swimming,  very strong rips and try to avoid in wet season when debri is washed up onto the beach. Can get some amazing sunsets and eateries there!"
Frankyschuman,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,Good for surfing though very run down area with no care for area Lots of rubbish in the waterLots of stray dogs and 3rd world surroundings 
Timothy R O,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2015,"If you're the surfing kind, you'll love some of the breaks, the warmer water and easy access to the beach, but from a swimmers point of view, the beaches on this side of the island are pretty gross to look at, dirty coloured sand doesn't look great.."
Mel P,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,I didn't feel the need to leave the Sanctuary but even when I did venture out it was close to everything.
Thommay,"Munich, Germany",Dec 2014,"long beach walks and jogging in the morning are great, sunsets in the evening stunning.ride a pushbike on the sand - or push it when it's to hard.warungs will provide food and drinks."
bhavanity,62 contributions,Sep 2014,"Love this place. Definitely a place for the surf boarders. A place where you can relax and chill. there is a toilet for shower but a simple 1. No hot water. If  you have never surfed before, Please get an expert to guide you as the currents are very strong and it can pull you further out to the sea. The seabed is not leveled, so the 3rd step, you could drop further deeper. All in all, I did enjoy the place and the view."
Piscator_78,"Cologne, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",Dec 2014,"Beach, Surf and Laid back atmosphere. Great food, nice people and a fantastic value. Nice waves and a good place to get back on the board- but definitely no beginners place, as there is a beachbreak and  rarely whitewater."
Alex M,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,Had a surf at Canggu beach today fun little waves. Convenient parking and a brilliant snow cone truck for when you are done. Not sure if it is always as dirty as it currently is though as it is wet season but alot of trash on beach and in water. Fun spot for a beginner wave but not somewhere my partner wanted to lay and tan due to the state of the beach.
khalid48,K Lumpur,Dec 2014,"It is peacefull, not too many people. Though people should be more carefull about where they throw their rubbish."
HellyandOli,6 contributions,Dec 2014,The rain and the wet season made the west coast very polluted. We had to travel to the east coast to surf / swim.
JunkHouse,Asia,Nov 2014,Crowded beach but worth to be out there to catch the waves. Best time I had was during sunset.. totally blown away by the beauty. 3 minutes walk to a bar and other restaurants. 
katka365,"Pilsen, Czech Republic",Nov 2014,"This beach is great for starting to learn surfing on a sandy surface with shallow water, trainers and surf rental available at the beach. "
SurfBee09,"East Lansing, MI",Oct 2014,"Perfect waves, surf board rentals and lessons, photographers to capture your surfing experiences, amazing restaurants and cafes, great beach atmosphere.  "
Clarissa C,"Glasgow, UK",Nov 2014,"Not your typical tropical beach that looks like paradise, but there aren¬¥t crowds, and it is pretty quiet. Good for beginner surfers as there are many breaks around, even though the crowds can be huge ate sunset, which is also worth watching."
melissa m,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,Everyone always talks about the sunset in Seminyak but it is the same here in Canggu. Even better as less crowded. Love the beach and the waves here. Very relaxing!
Veronica S,"Melton, Australia",Aug 2014,"The surf is good here. The sand is black  because of Bali's now extinct (I hope) volcanoes. Comes as a shock if your not used to black sand but hey, some people have beaches that are all pebbles! Sit and watch the sunset and sip a beer. Very soothing."
CaliGia,"San Diego, CA",Sep 2014,"We stayed at the Tugu Hotel because my boyfriend loves surfing... It's a pretty sunset, but not worth more than a day trip. There was so much trash on the beach, stray animals and sewage running into the water where the surfers surf. I would recommend visiting Seminyak for surfing instead."
Mayu106,"Tokyo, Japan",Sep 2014,Big waves and currents but nice to stroll and sit at some of the beach cafes to watch the skillful surfers. Looks like one an expat community favourite locations. Upcoming area 
whereintheworldisgpc,"Zurich, Switzerland",Sep 2014,Canggu Beach is not made for bathing but its great for surfing. The reef brake brings out great waves and offers good conditions for intermediate to advanced surfers. Few board rentals and surf teachers are available on the beach as well as some restaurants and canggus institution old man's bar.
MurrumbaJo,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2014,"If you do not mind black sand this is a nice beach.  Lots of learner and better surfers towards Old Man's Beach.  Nothing to eat or drink here. Fishing boats, old boat shacks, photographers, walkers and a great sunset."
Ankitpri,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,"quite towards the rights stretch of the beach, can lye down and enjoy shades and drinks provided by locals"
Diana M,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Sep 2014,It's very nice but it isn't the kind of the beach to swimming and relax cos there are a lot of waves most of the time
chris0084,117 contributions,Aug 2014,"We stood in Canggu village in a nice villa and went to Canggu Beach. We were very disappointed and we didn't expect a perfect beach. We were looking for a relaxed beach with a few people. The beach was very dirty, with rubbish from local people but also from tourists. The surfers like the good waves, but for the rest there is nothing. We would not recommand it at all. On the way to the beach are some very nice restaurants and bars. Stopp there for lunch or dinner and go to Echo Beach, it's a little bit better."
Jason D,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,nice beach for sunset. lots of rubbish and generally dirty which is a pity as it's a wonderful spot. Surfing is excellent.
Schungo,"Furstenfeldbruck, Germany",Aug 2014,"Beach for surfers. Beginners can easily find surf instructers or play in the whitewater. All others find consistent swell. Lots of Boardsds to hire (Short, Long, Beginners). Small Bites, cafes and Restaurants avaiable.Not good for swimmers, nice to watch the sunset"
IckenhamChris,"Ruislip, UK",Aug 2014,"Good sandy beach, a few  sun loungers on beach or on grassed area just above the beach. Great for Surfing, swimming best when it is low tide. Couple of beach bars with food nearby"
AnthonyV2222,"Port Douglas, Australia",Jun 2014,"Great place to get some satay, grab a drink and watch the sun go down with some background music. Small markets. Thoroughly enjoyable."
255100Sunlover,"Mt Eliza, Australia",Aug 2014,"Had a morning coffee at Ol Man's cafe here. It's always nice to chill and watch the surf.  This is a great surf beach, plenty of boards etc available for hire, but not one that I would visit to swim to lie on the beach. Also thought the area was a bit trashy - more effort needed to clean it up."
WouterBaliIndonesia,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun 2014,Nice to take a walk when it's not to hot. Canggu beach is mainly a surf beach without much (sun-)bathing accomodation. There is often a lot of thrash on the beach left there by the tides and feeded by the rivers of Bali and Java. Despite the overpopulation and 9 million visitors a year there is no proper thrash collection on Bali. The Balinese even avoid often the paid service there is and throw their thrash in the rivers. It ends up in the sea and the tide brings it to the beach including used pampers and worse. Just dumping in the sea also goes for the sewage. The whole island with millions of people doing there thing right into the sea. The consequences are that survers are confronted with ear infections and worse. The surfers are by the way the only people who can go safely into the sea. Bathing is risky because of the treacherous currents which take every year several people who drown. But it's a nice beach to walk.
Dave9G,"Ghent, Belgium",Jul 2014,"Volcanic sand beach which had quite some litter laying around. We found the other beaches we went to on our holiday much nicer than this one, although it does offer good conditions for sufers."
new2travelling,Warkworth,Jul 2014,"Lots of surfers and a few cafes (we tried a large fancy Grocer and Grind one which was nice but not cheap), black sand, more rustic beach for surfing and exploring rather than relaxing."
sbgholse,"Nagpur, India",Jun 2014,I went here in the evening.It has black sand unlike kuta and senymak beaches in bali.it iss not so attractive and pleasant
BelMac,"Mount Macedon, Australia",Jun 2014,"There are many surfing beaches in Canggu - Pererenan, Echo, Batu Bolong, Berawa... They are all black sand, not so developed as other beaches in Bali and have great surf. Not so good for swimming unless you are experienced."
vee_vita,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"Surfer are welcome here! There are so many surf board rentals and there cafe too. This beach is good for surfing, but not for beginner I think. There are some solid rocks make surfing a bit dangerous if you're a beginner. Locals are everywhere too but not as crowded as Kuta and Seminyak beach."
Irfantaufikr,"Bandung, Indonesia",Nov 2013,"I went to canggu bad session. So, i can't see the best wave in here. But my friend told to me, if I go when best session, i can see the best wave here. Sometimes, I will back there and try to surfing there. One more, Sand of canggu beach is black"
dancingdooth,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2014,"Went for a walk along the beaches of Canggu... dark brown sand..I think we are spoilt with the beaches in Australia, as a comparison.. saw horseriders & lots of surfers, with good waves..so this is the main attraction... parts of beach very littered, and a few bali dogs to beware of... not one of my most favourite places"
J-Lou_travels,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Black sanded beach not very good for swimming, but an awesome place to surf regardless of ability. Good channel to swim out plus the peak give you long rides. Local guides and boards are available from the car parks and there is always a coconut waiting for you after your time in the water. "
waleos,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,"I dont know what its really called, batu bolong beach, or canggu beach, but the place marker at this site' review is wrong, as its nowhere near the beach. There's other reviews also about this beach. Anyhow, talking about the beach, its big waves and surfers paradise. There's plenty of surf boards for rent at the beach, few eating places, beach style, nothing fancy and the waves are just strong. Think twice before swimming there. Very quiet, not that many people and kind of peacefull for a relaxing holiday."
Mark F,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2014,"It looked better than Kuta Beach, calm and far away from noisy thing around there.Local people so nice and help to get direction to find the beach. Worth it."
bazzawa,"Marmion, Australia",Apr 2014,We were there at low tide and found it an unattractive beach. It is interesting to watch the surfers if the surf is up.
kelly b,"Brasilia, DF",Mar 2014,"i have visited canggu beach very nice please but right now canggu beach is not good because very dirty with rubish if the beach clean very good, over all i suggest the surrounding community to keep clean on the beach"
DragonTracks,"Tokyo, Japan",Mar 2014,What a dirty smelly place. Lots of rubbish and dog poo everywhere.  Sat on the steps by the beach but the smell from possibly a sewage pipe quickly made me move! Lots of surfers to watch which was the only fun aspect of the beach. There were a lot of dogs on the beach....some with owners but many without. I hope the expensive hotels just up the road from the beach invest some money into clearing it up. It has potential.

However, we jumped on the waves near the shore.As far as I understood, this place is well suited for surfers primary and secondary levels. Not many people, quietly, calmly. The sand is volcanic black and very small partickles. Finally it was just about everywhere in or clothes and bags!On the beach there is an excellent Sand Bar with very friendly and helpful staff. It is possible to rent beach beds, umbrellas and ""soft chairs"" for 50.000IDR. You can also rent a surf board or boogie board. There is quite good list of cocktails and all kind of snacks.Every week they make open air parties.Slightly aside several restaurantsare situated, serving grilled seafood. Sooooo tasty!This is the place where I hope to come back again!"
RJ R,"West Palm Beach, FL",Mar 2014,This area has great waves and breaks if you enjoy surfing. It is not a swimming beach. The unfortunate problem all waters around Bali have is the surmounting issue of trash. And it is too bad. Hopefully Bali and the surrounding islands will get his under control before more damage is done.
Airmanis,"Western Australia, Australia",Feb 2014,"Canggu beach was once a beautiful piece of coast but it is now a collection of half demolished sea walls, ghost hotel developments and concrete. Talk about paradise lost! Go south to Batu Bolong for a nice beach /surf experience."
luvlight,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,this is a lovely part of bali with lots of villas in rice fields and some good restaurants and shops increasingly built up with more choices for eating every time we comethe area is relatively quiet but has lots of things to do shop eat surf yoga shop around as prices and value vary a great deal
Frederic D,"Le Havre, France",Aug 2013,"Dislike: Black sand, Garbage, Dogs, Dog's poop, Like: Sorry tell you the truth, nothing I like from this beach"
Audrey T,19 contributions,Jan 2014,"Due to the high human traffic & lack of cleaning services, the beaches are generally filthy but for advanced level waves and a cheaper alternative to Seminyak, come here for sunset and dinner."
patrick l,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2013,Canggu is a great place to learn how to surf and progress. Start at Old Man's for the nice slow waves and move to Echo for the fast steeper waves. The warungs on the beach have good food at good prices. Black sand and at low tide good for swimming. Be aware of waste in the water. Just like the rest of Bali is Canggu unfortunately really dirty!
FiDeVi,Darwin,Nov 2013,"I love this beach, rugged with a beautiful black/golden sandQuiet with a good friendly local vibe!Enjoyed a dip in the ocean too.If your not a strong swimmer or surfer beware of rips(note: it's not in a popular tourist area so there can be some rubbish on the beach)"
Linda K,"London, UK",Oct 2013,liked that it was not a busy commercialised beach - it felt very real and local.  Disliked that it was in need of a bit of a clean up in terms of debris
Kimberley F,Hong Kong,Oct 2013,"Best beginner / intermediate surf spot. Go to Canggu Cafe after your morning session to grab a good, strong Bali coffee and some breakfast! Crowded during the weekdays from around 8am when the surf schools come in so try and get out there a little earlier! Ketut, a photographer, usually hangs out by the temple. Go talk to him before you head out on the waves if you want your moment to be captured on film! They'll either charge you for a single photograph or everything they get of you for the day. "
Alex P,"Exeter, UK",Oct 2013,"Canggu is a great beach, really good facilities and cafes, surf hire for just about every type of board (though some are a bit banged up) and instructors who are really pleasant and treat everyone really nicely. The waves shift about throughout the day but there is something for everyone from the learners close in to the really serious folk out back, the paddle out there is an epic though! There is a really strong rip between Canggu and Echo which is between the the little reefs at the north end of Canggu and when the tide is in the beaches are cut off from each other. On the whole this is my favourite beach in the world, the water is warm, the people are really friendly and you don't need to drag your best board with you as there are loads to choose from at the surf shacks. The beach is a bit grubby, but no more than Portuguese beaches and you hardly notice. Should definitely be on everyone's list of places to surf."
hollie n,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2013,"Perfect surf, easy access, beautiful volcanic sand that sparkles. Path being built across top of beach for access to Echo Beach cafes."
Torerow,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2013,"Nice wild natural beach with high waves. Perfectly for chilling and sunsets, but be careful with swimming!"
oceanienne,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Oct 2013,"for persons who want to pass all sunday there, it's interesting and quiet place.The road to go there it's really nice in the middle of the rice field, not so far for the Tanah lot temple and the Nirwana golf."
Muselulu,"Portland, OR",Sep 2013,"My friend took her first surfer lesson here at Canggu Beach, and she said it was amazing. I enjoyed the view and there's a small temple there as well. Further down Batu Bolong, there are spas and a number of restaurants. A number of the restaurants seem to be non-Indo cuisine though. "
NadZ,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2013,"Beaches in Canggu area ideally good for surfing, sunset and cocktail. Such a nice time to spend my time here to explore beaches for surfing and meeting new people.I feel so delighted to choose Casa Kamboja as my homestay. They only have 4 bedrooms, but there's always surfers, really easy to find friends for surfing or hangout together.."
Jordy A,"New York City, NY",Sep 2013,Went for a paddle here but its super crowded any russiansRussians surfing - Go figure Its a great place to visit very traditional balinese people
Chase J,"Washington DC, DC",Aug 2013,"This beach has about one year left before the mega hotels (already under construction) take it over and it becomes Semenyak Part II (seriously, there's a second Potato Head being built). In the meantime come here for good waves and an excellently mellow bar and restaurant scene along the water. "
June S,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2013,Frequented by top surfers. Black sand and beach not particularly clean as no beach cleaning system in place.
Phoebe1960,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Jun 2013,"Nice long stretch of beach in both directions, you can see Kuta on one end and Tanah lot and Echo Beach at the other. Looked very safe for swimming and a lot of surfers frequent this beach."
AvidTraveler12,"Winchester, UK",May 2013,"Bali is not blessed with glorious white talcum powder beaches, the sand is not even yellow, most beaches  are muddy brown in colour and some are black sand, this is due to the volcanic nature of the island. Canguu beach is no different, there are many different colours of sand, why I like it so much is because it stetches for miles and miles, in fact Kuta beach, Legian beach, Seminyak beach, Echo beach etc, are in fact all one continious beach that overlaps the various areas on the South Western tip of Bali. I have walked from Echo Beach to Kuta Beach which will take about two hours. I stopped because I was tired and a rainstorm was setting in, I could have walked for longer as I had not run out of beach!Many hotels, beach bars and restaurants to help break up the walking or if you feel hungry."
FeildingTracey,Feilding,May 2013,"Nice quiet beach, great watching the fishing boats come in each day. Lots of surfers and nice little cafes overlooking the beach"
Elledunlop,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2013,"best place to hang out in bali, my favourite sunset spot, and best calamari at mandira cafe. They also do a great seafood bbq at a couple of the resturaunts that line the beach, excellent view, food and good prices. "
Nicole B,"Derby, Australia",Apr 2013,"We walked along the beach, found it hard to enjoy as there was a lot of rubbish floating around.There is a nice caf√© near the surfing area however which was packed.Did a good breakfast."
Bogyglfr,"Round Rock, TX",Apr 2012,"I just stopped by here on my way to Tanah Lot and found it to be a decent beach. It was a little dirty, but that was due to the storm that came through the night before. Other than that, i found some nice shells there. i did have to avoid a couple folks trying to sell me things, but other than that it was ok. Next time I would like to spend a little more time there and check out the area."
Sergey,"Canggu, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Like all beaches in Canggu this one is very popular among surfers, and is always crowded for sunset, especially on weekends. But the beach most of the time is not very suitable for swimming for big waves. Neither I would suggest sunbathing as it's quite  dirty, especially after rains, and has no sunbeds available as there are no warungs there right on waterfront. You can hardly use it for running as the beach is interupted here and there by number of rivers, some of them very small coming and going depending on rainfall, still you will be able to cross bigger ones only if bearfooted. Still it can be a nice walk before sunset, and of course this is the place if you came to Bali either to surf, or take surfing lessons"
Frans S,13 contributions,Feb 2013,"The reef break is pretty consistent, not to big (until 6 ft) and not dangerous (flat rock). On the parking lot there is plenty of boardhire shops and surf lessons. At the end of the day the parking lot fills up with surfers and local people walking their dogs, a nice sun downer with a bintang!"
VinaTraveler,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2013,"Canggu is beach for surfers...But. if you want to do photography , you can have the best sunset here. A black beach area, very hot and also a lot of dogs. Better to go around 6pm, as if you come earlier on that time...it is Extremely Hot as no umbrellas or shades you can get it unless you will go to the resraurant, ordered and stayed there for a while."
Waiting617,"Taoyuan District, Taoyuan",Jul 2012,"the beach is clear and not so crowded, and also some people tide the horses there, but the sellers always bother you."
susi08,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2013,It was a very hot day when we went to Canggu beach and the sands were extremely hot. The lounge seats and beach umbrellas were very limited. A couple of locals were fishing on the beach. Some dogs were running around unleashed. A couple of women were topless. One hour on that beach was more than enough.
Kira,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2012,"White cafes, white umbrellas, white paints on walls against the dark brown (almost black-ish sand). Picturesque. Chilled out good vibe. Good spot for beginner-intermediate surfers. Affordable food n Bintangs served at the cafes."
InekeParis,"Paris, France",Jan 2013,"Good for surfers, but the beach is not very nice. When we were there, the beach was polluted with trash (slippers, plastic, packaging). Besides, the canggu beach does not have the best eating options. The nearby Echo beach has more options. "
LizK3,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2012,I am sure the beach would be gorgeous if a massive clean up of plastic bags and other rubbish happened!
Broscuta P,"Vienna, Austria",Jan 2012,"is nicer than in Kuta, because there are not so many turists. It is a surfer sport and there are two ore three restaurants with very good food and cheap. Internet  wi fi is also available."
Janeo56,Port Noarlunga  Australia,Nov 2012,"Lots of ceremonies with a major Temple right on the beach. Sunday my favourite with many Balinese families coming to swim, eat, pray and generally hang out"
davepoop,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2012,"The sands might be dark, but the beach and the waves, the galleries (Surfer Girl, Hurley, Yokii, and Havaianas), the restaurants and all the stuff they have as a  ""bedside"" shall be unforgettable. Don't forget the sunset :P"
Jeremy L,5 contributions,Aug 2012,"This is a great beach if you are an mid level surfer, can handle some crowds and want to have fun. Go in the dry season! Stay at the Chillhouse for the best possible experience!"
Deniz E,"Istanbul, Turkey",Oct 2012,"Good beach for surfing but it gets a bit crowded, just go early... Sunsets are beautiful. The beach is also safe for just swimming but there are nicer beaches just for a swim in bali:)"
JayKayAndDana,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2012,"Quiet, older, surfing crowd.  The palce to go away from the parties and noise...just to enjoy the beach and waves and vibe."
Trey M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2012,"We spent a day at Echo Beach, a short drive from Canggu, and an hour and a half from Ubud, where we were staying. The beach is not Bali's prettiest, nor its cleanest, but it does have decent surf for beginner to intermediate surfers, and is laid back enough to be enjoyable for a day trip. We had our 3 children, ages 7, 7, and 10, with us. They took a 2-hour lesson with the Canggu Surf School, which was well worth the money ($60 p.p. for 2 hours). The beach has a single alley with a few shops, and a handful of restaurants, so don't visit expecting the full-on, Bali tourist experience. In my opinion, this is a GOOD thing! The people who come here seem to be more relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak, and the lack of in-your-face commercialism is refreshing. I suspect the area was nicer a few years ago, before rampant development got underway. Right now, there's an enormous hotel going up, as well as a large number of apartments, and it detracts from the overall ""undiscovered"" vibe of the place. Probably has another year or so before it succumbs to the unzoned, unplanned development chaos that has subsumed a lot of Bali. Two unexpected high points: (1) The Echo Beach cafe, nearest to the temple, has a sensational BBQ every night. Worth staying past dark for! (2) If you like motorcycle/surf culture, the Deus Ex Machina Temple of Enthusiasm is just down the road."
Ozzy O,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2012,"There ARE places to get a drink - be that soft drinks, beer, milkshakes and fruit juices, great food too. Service is friendly and great.You can go right from a great surf, to relax and eat and drink, then get back out for another surf.Beginner-Intermediate through to advance waves."
moanaw42,4 contributions,Sep 2012,"the waves were good in the mornings and evenings, im from Hawaii and had a blast surfing the right down on the north end. "
T_Killeen,T_diddy,Sep 2012,Quiet area with some nice restaurants. Black/grey sand. Lots of stray dogs (that are harmless). Horse riding is available and the surfers seemed to be enjoying the huge waves.
Baliti4l,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2012,Although we do not surf this beach is fab and lovely surrounding restaurants and a lot quieter than Kuta and Seminyak.  
GinkgoB,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2012,"I agree with Alex U below. I found this beach lovely and peaceful for walking along in both directions - up northwards to Echo Beach and southwards past Berawa, etc. I never actually swam right at the main Canggu beach, as the flags were rarely up at the times I was walking and I didn't really fancy swimming so near a river anyway. It is not a bright white beach, as the sand is a mix of volcanic rock and other matter, but I didn't spot any rubbish or other signs of dirt.The second photo was taken shortly after all the fishing boats had come in and they were just putting up the swimming flags just north of the creek. But mostly there were few people on the beach most times I walked down there from my villa."
RedNeice,"London, UK",May 2012,Possibly the most filthy beach we saw in Bali and the water quality was terrible.  When your skin is itching when you get out it's never a good sign!!
Angie O,"Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan, Malaysia",Jul 2012,"Beach is dirty, nothing much to explore. Good for surfers. Good waves, other than that, nothing else to explore. Not suitable for swimming as too big waves. "
TheStarskys,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2012,"You need the right conditions, but Canggu Beach has some fun peaks for varying levels of ability. Plenty of places to park, and a couple of Warungs for that post-surf Coke or Bali coffee."
EndlessSummer2012,"San Francisco, CA",Aug 2012,"After spending 3 weeks in Bali in 2008, my wife and I decided to come back for a month and stay so I could surf and we could enjoy the island.  Having surfed Bali before (Uluwatu/Bukit) and coming off a surf boat charter in the Maldives, I couldn't wait to get in the water in Bali.  Got to Canggu beach and I admit that it was a bit disappointing.  I felt like I was back at Ocean Beach in San Francisco vs. Bali.  The waves were a combo beach/reef break with long paddle outs and ok waves.  The SE trade winds also came up very early so I had to be up at dawn to get a couple of hours in before the winds were blowing 15-20 MPH side shore.  I should have brought a kite board!  We've made a few trips already down to surf the Bukit because it was too big in Canggu to even paddle out, and it's going off all day with offshores, white sand beaches, and perfect clear blue/green water breaking over consistent reef.  I hate to complain, which I feel like I'm doing...but I had visions of perfect waves that I could surf at any time of the day for the entire month.  I should have done more research...but maybe this will help you.  :-)"
Eddie M,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2012,dirty and poor access to the beach.  We had to walk through a buildingsite to get to it.  there are no facilities anywhere nearby and nowhere to get a drink.
James L,"Phuket, Thailand",Aug 2011,I like to see new thing and meet new peoples. I love travel
Tom R,Helena,Dec 2011,"Good surf, sandy beach, used by the locals, could have beencleaner in places this was in December 2010"
SilviaRobi,"Torino, Italia",May 2012,"wonderful beach, especially with great waves for surfing, relatively clean for Bali"
prg_spion,"Prague, Czech Republic",Nov 2011,"This is definitely a more chill area of Bali - a few hotels/villas have access to this beach and it's just beautiful. Im sure there are better in Bali, but something about the ""end of the road"" vibe of it got to me."
SallyG0Lightly,Brooklyn,Nov 2011,Great place to hang with the girlfriends and have a drink at sunset. Fun place to run into people. 
Jaarman,"Tartu, Estonia",Jan 2012,"Nice place for surfers, but unfortunately a lot of trash on the beach, specially after heavy rains and winds"
DanoCanada,Canada,Dec 2011,"The beach is black volcanic sand, which isn't so bad except it gets too hot. The big problem is the strong surf and pounding waves, which make it unsuitable for swimming or even wading. Construction along the beach is also making it difficult to walk along the beach in some stretches. Stick to the pool!"
JustinRBoyd,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2011,Great spot for surfing and swimming or just relaxing at one of the warongs along the beach and perhaps getting a massage or a Bintang. Canggu beach is very pleasant and has the most spectacular sunsets during November and December.Surf instructors available for beginners and board hire. Entry to the parking area is Rp2000
Aussie_Nate,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2011,The sand here is black.The people on and around the beach area are very friendly.There is plenty of swimming area but be careful when the swell is up as rips can start very veyr quickly and can be quite vicious.
ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"One of the most popular beaches in Bali, Double Six Beach attracts crowds of tourists from nearby Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. The waves are mild here - perfect for first time surfers. Plenty of sunchairs to sit on, umbrellas to sit under, and coolers full of beers to sip."
Chelsea B,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2019,The beach was quite busy and as a consequence you'll find lots of people touting things from sunglasses to boat tours but the beach itself was nice and cleaner than some we'd come across.
Finds_posts,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"a very touristy place. lots of restaurants, gift shops and the water isn't that really clear like in Maldives or Ibiza. foods are very cheap in here"
Udita,3 contributions,May 2019,Cleaner than seminayk or kuta beach .There are other better beaches in bali than this. Good beach clubs to enjoy closeby like cucoon beach club
Marjut0303,"Vantaa, Finland",Nov 2019,"Nice double six beach in Seminyak Bali, worth visiting! Also comfortable sun beds on the beach and the sunsets are amazing colourful! There are some cosy restaurants where to eat; food was excellent!"
Kev,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Aug 2019,"Very nice beach to take a stroll. Although you get HOUNDED by people trying to sell you things. You don't get left alone for too long, which gets annoying. "
Peter R,"Liverpool, UK",Dec 2019,"Good beach, nice and clean,  good surf if you like that sort of thing.  I walked from Double Six down to Kuta beach and then returned north to Seminyak beach. A lovely afternoon barefoot walk."
vanessasmith75,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,Nice spot to hang out with friends. We can see also sunset which is amazing. Beside that there are many options of restaurants we can choose along the beach. 
2TravellingGeordies,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Dec 2019,Wrote a previous review up our stay in Seminyak and visiting the beaches here in Bali.Found Double 6 beach filled with plastics from high to low water. Nothing in the way of locals picking up the rubbish ranging from plastic bottle tops to plastic bags and old rope. How much damage is all this rubbish doing to marine life and not to mention the tourists entering these waters... the rubbish is not from tourism but from the rivers that flood once rain has fallen. Once you look beyond the rubbish I wonder how much none seen pollutants are in there!!!?.
Chris S,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"Great for surfing but not for swimming as the sea is too rough. Evenings are great as the bars & restaurants along the beach prepare for the amazing sunsets with lanterns, candles, comfy bean bag chairs & live music which all contributes to a memorable time"
kimseouhyoon,"Seoul, South Korea",Dec 2019,"The location is very close from city , you can enjoy the beach and buy coconut water during waiting the beautiful sunset"
stephenpysc,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"This is the section of the beach in Bali that is relaxed and has everything you need from water sports, to surfing, to chair and drinks. Great for sunset.!"
Dumbamakeche,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2019,Good beach to spend our time while waiting for the golden hour (sunset) so many restaurant around here and local deli (Bakso gerobak biru) is delicious and affordable. 
Cameliapark,2 contributions,Aug 2019,"It was my second time in Bali, still beautiful as always and this beach is the most beautiful here. Definitely will visit this beach every time i come to bali."
smithtan,12 contributions,Dec 2019,Really recommended. One of the best place to get the magical sunset where many bar surriunding to entertain you.
Amanda & Moha,13 contributions,Oct 2019,"Had so much fun at double six last time i was there im going again in the next few days. There will be a break in the rain and I'm there. Very impressed with the food but you cant beat the atmosphere with lanterns under coloured umbrellas. Have to mention the double apple shisha and the bands. The lovely happy staff and the waves crashing, its an awesome sunset."
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,"Double Six is a wide beach area between Seminyak and Kuta. A few hotels are next to it but it is one of the more underdeveloped areas of Bali. When we were there the beach was quite dirty, it was shocking to be honest, according to some reviews it has improved a lot it seems. We strolled along the beach all the way from Seminyak to Kuta and it is a fantastic beach walk, and once the sun starts to set even more picturesque."
widya artika,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"We really took a great time here to enjoy the sunset. The service was good and comfortable, we didn't even realise the time here as we talked and enjoyed the view."
Nikz1390,"Jaipur, India",Nov 2019,Good place to relax with various shacks and places to sit . Most restaurants have sitting area and evening live music on beach at restaurants 
Swanand Oak,3 contributions,Nov 2019,"A lot of cafes, bars and restaurants with variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Prompt service by staff."
The World is My Oyster,"Orlando, FL",Nov 2019,Really couldn't get enough on how incredibly amazing the sunset was. The beach got real crowded with hundreds of colorful bean bags and umbrellas. The live music was also so cool and created an amazing atmosphere. An absolute must do while in Bali!
Indira N,3 contributions,Oct 2019,"Lovely beach club right by the beach, great music, food and ambiance, a definite hit! I had an awesome time everytime I came, which was often."
KevMac1960,"Stanford-Le-Hope, UK",Nov 2019,Nice enough beach which appeared to be pretty popular with surfers. Unfortunately it seemed a bit grubby to me and the hawkers were a bit of a pain. It was all ok but I imagine their nicer places to spend a day on the sand. I may not be a good reviewer for this place as I‚Äôm not really a beach person ha ha
Tissai,"Brno, Czech Republic",Nov 2019,"Nice Beach, not suitable for swimming, but great for surfing. Many bars with live music in evening to watch the sunset."
MaryBolo,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019,We loved it here! The atmosphere was amazing and the sunset was out of the world! Definitely a must visit when visiting Baliüíï
N2N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2019,"Wonderful beach to holiday, great place to watch sunset with a drink, food and music, good for families and couple."
mutiaraputrilestari,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Double Six Beach is one of the never ending happening spot in Bali! What makes it become everyone's favourite is because it's strategic location for a sunset catcher, not too far away from Kuta Beach but way cleaner, nice sand and has a lot of fancy beach bars and restos to chill out. We can find a lot of domestic and foreign tourists here have fun by soaking up the sun, playing by the beach or surfing."
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Sep 2019,"Were there last year, and really was not impressed with the beach itself, it seemed scraggy and dirty and were some dogs Doo doo really didn‚Äôt want to do more than a paddle, this year I still felt slightly uncomfortable walking through so we decided to carry on walking up the beach and we found some proper bars and seats and it felt as if we had gone to another part of the island, it was so clean and tidy and we could sit down on bean bags and we ended up going there the rest of the 10 days to the spot on the beach and I really started enjoying it and felt a lot better and continued to go into the Chiringuito Restaurant & Bar ‚Äì Highly recommended and definitely going back again- Thank you"
Maureen M,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,Fine groomed sand and lovely warm waters. Take the locals knowledge on board on deciding best time of day to go surfing.  They are accurate within an hour.  Look out for rips and undertows which are endorsed by red flags alond beach.  It is otherwise a very nice safe beach.Plenty of cafes and surf board hire places along the beach. We paid 50000IDR (about 5 AUD) per hour for surfboard hire. Reallly good sate sticks cooked over coal   at Capil Cafe.Plenty of shopping opportunities in and around Double six beach.
Jean1823,"Nagoya, Japan",Oct 2019,"great view of the sunset.. many vendors too, even at the bar they will approach you ;( but not as congested as Kuta. We walked by the beach from Kuta, and from Kuta beach to Double Six Beach the waves are nonstop so it‚Äôs good for surfing but not swimming."
Kate N,"Largs Bay, Australia",Oct 2019,Get down and see Carlos for a beach chair. Gorgeous beach. Lots of fun in the surf. Watch out for the rips. Make sure you swim between the flags. Gorgeous sunset. K-Resto has good meals. 
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2019,"Great spot to view the sunset. Clean and not too crowded. Plenty of space to move around, or too place ball. Family friendly. "
BJM,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,Well it is still not as clean as it could be...but much much better than it has been...we all need to help keep any beach clean and enjoyable for all. The surf school was a good place for the kids to have a go at surfing...the instructors were quite patient...it was a fun time
Malferg,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,"It's a nice, clean and not overcrowded beach. It's quite wide and dotted with umbrella's and lounges for rent and lots of Beach Clubs and Bars . There are a heaps of Traders flogging their wares. If you're like me and dont go to Kuta this is the place to watch the sunset."
Ellenia R,"Bandung, Indonesia",Oct 2019,I came to this beach for watch the sunset and the view it's really amazing. I can't describe with words but it really beautiful
Louise H,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2019,"Spent the day here, beautiful resort and staff very friendly. Loved the restaurant,  fresh and delicious food. Highly recommend!"
myers9720,"Oceanside, CA",Sep 2019,My husband and I really enjoyed this beach. It‚Äôs very reasonable to rent lounge chairs and an umbrella. They give surf lessons here and it‚Äôs fun to watch everyone. Lots  of restaurants on the beach with okay food. The beach is very clean.
Lynnelle S,Perth,Sep 2019,"Whilst we love this area for sunset drinks at our favourite beach bar, we feel the area in general is looking very run down. There was the work dome to build the big wall along the beach front but the road area and empty restaurants falling into ruin looks terrible. The corner of Arjuna and Blue Ocean beach road is an accident waiting to happen with rubble falling from the sidewalk onto the road and then the corner where the Sin Ken Ken is and Trattoria were are filthy and falling apart.The bougainvillea growing from the Sin Ken Ken is downright dangerous to walker by traffic.It appears somebody is paying staff to secure the property but no maintenance is being done and it is a ruin."
Hawks2008,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"Good beach - not nearly as crowded as the Legian beach to the south. Good lounges, expect to pay 100k Rupia for two. Lovely swimming"
Erica,33 contributions,Aug 2019,"The sunset is so beautiful , you can play on the beach with your friends and see a beautiful sunset , the beach is so clean!"
Vicki,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2019,A beautiful spot to watch the surf & the sun going down on a bean bag with beer or cocktail in hand . Soo relaxing & the best sunsets you will ever see  
KelsSydney_Australia,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2019,"Great spot for cocktails and watching the sun set. Great vibe for families, couples and all visitors to Bali. There are many bars to choose from and there are always locals flying their huge kites. Highly recommended "
stephen m,"Heywood, UK",Sep 2019,"lovely beach about 20 mins drive from Rama Residence but will take much longer to get back due to traffic, taxis very cheap if you use Bluebird but be careful with private hire they will ask for much more, so haggle.The beach is a surfers paradise and not for swimmers but still nice to visit. The beach hawkers will try to sell to you but all very pleasant.Also very safe to leave things  whilst away from sunbeds"
FFF22,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"Sitting on beanbags watching the sunset with friends, Mojito & Satay while listening to some awesome music, choose your preference, lay back and enjoy!"
Tania C,28 contributions,Sep 2019,"This is a great beach and u can hire a great lounger and umbrella for only 100,000 rupi. The water is warm and the sand warm and smooth . It is perfect with a good book EXCEPT the hawkers wanting to sell u everything from food, artwork and sun glasses"
608trudyl,67 contributions,Sep 2019,"Quite a crowded place, though sand is not white but greyish instead, is still clean and fine.  Lots of surfers and tourist there.  Saw quite a few dogs there and they were really happy playing around.  Amount of tourists there sometimes makes you wait for a good photo shot, especially during sunset when the colour is so beautiful.  Plenty of bars and restaurants on beach.  Shallow waters and not much shells or sharp stones, so not a problem to stroll along the beach without footwear."
Neil G,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Aug 2019,It is getting harder to get to now with one way street but if you are staying in a hotel nearby then it is easily accessible by foot good beach to lay around on except if the wind is from the ocean side as then it get sandy and dirty quickly
Javi,"Tucson, AZ",Nov 2018,"Good food and nice view, especially for the sunset. They also have bands that play songs upon request at times."
bluehive,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,"The biggest beach I have ever seen. Just beautiful with flat shallow water. It's full of people and equally good for surfing and swimming. Safe for kids, and had got many sun tables. You can easily relax and unwind. Water is mud colored unlike Malesti beach that had movie like blue water. Overall a must visit beach in Seminyak. "
Katy D,45 contributions,Sep 2019,Very touristy and busy with lots of sellers asking for trade. Good place for some surf lessons. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Nice place to sit with a Bintang and watch the sun go down
shanbabyshan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,This beach was about a 5 mins walk from our Villa De Liza! Clean beach with a fair bit of pretty decent beach bars! 
iayzit2,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,You can just cross the road which is not very wide and you are on the beach. Hotel exclusive beach site section is well looked after by the staff.
donmalcolm,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2019,"What better place to enjoy the sun, than from on a lounger under an umbrella on a magnificent white sandy beach.Surfers, sunbathers and people coming in going, mostly young and fit, a place to enjoy"
g_beresford,"Sorrento, Australia",Aug 2019,It is so nice to just lay on one the beach lounges watching the surf üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è having a Bintang & etching the people going by. This is what Bali is all about!.
laidbackterritorian,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,"Definitely the place to chill, listen to some live music on a beanbag drinking a cold bintang / cocktail watching the sunset over the ocean...even buy a watch for $10 if you like üòÇ sums up #balilife"
Robyn D,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"Lots of places to eat along the shore, went to breakfast twice there (blue 9 beach restaurant, which was on the double six beach). Rented three body boards for the day, the prices weren‚Äôt too bad! Able to rent a seat and umbrella as well. Waves were good, though a small riptide was found while out there. Be careful. Otherwise very safe to be in. Sand was rather hot in the sun, burnt my feet. I recommend this beach."
Bec Gildare,"South Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,"My first visit to Bali and chose this resort based on location and price.  Great value for money.  Friendly, clean and everything you need closeby."
m sena,3 contributions,Aug 2019,"plain beach with plain sea, nothing special at there. too much people, not comfort for chilling at all"
Roger-North,"Altrincham, UK",Aug 2019,"A beautiful beach well-served by lively restaurants and beach bars, with huge bean-bags to sit amongst the crowds of beach and sea lovers. Very popular amongst surfers and not bad for others wanting a bit of a swim and splash within the high-crowned waves. The beach is extremely clean. However, you have to jump-over two open-sewage streams coming out to sea from the land. This is not difficult in the drier seasons. Don't let your children play in this stream - surely the stench should ring an alarm bell amongst parents, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Well-worth a visit and can easily spend a good few hours soaking up the atmosphere and admiring the views passing through,"
Himanshu Jain,"Jaipur, India",May 2019,"Good time to visit at sunset, you can see very beautiful view of sunset, and beach is assailable very easily, you can't swim there."
Lyndamey,"Indented Head, Australia",Jul 2019,"Great place to watch sunset, with a drink, food and music. Suitable for families and couples. Love watching the stars and the planes coming into the airport."
Peppermaisy,"Ocean Grove, Australia",Jul 2019,"The colourful bean bags and umbrellas at sunset make this a wonderful beach to holiday near. However be careful swimming here, a young man  a tourist on his honeymoon)  drowned at this beach the week I was here. There are rips and the surf can get rough.  It‚Äôs a great beach to walk each morning and definitely the place to be for sunset ."
S p,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"I'm writing this to warn other travellers, this beach is extremely dangerous as it has very strong currents. It has killed many travellers including the death of my cousin only a few days ago while he was vacationing with his family. He was a very strong swimmer and had good athletic ability, but the rip tide was too strong and carried him away. I hope this message gets to as many people as possible, it's difficult to tell when the ocean current will come, so please be careful when swimming in this beach. You can do a search on the many swimmers deaths in this beach and you can find out what a rip tide current is. Thank you"
blackeldo,"Kiama, Australia",Jun 2019,"A NEW NAME AND APPEARANCE FOR AN OLD SPOT‚Ä¶.¬≠I first visited in the early 80s ‚Äì stayed here in 2015 ‚Äì and checked it out annually since.A NEW NAME - this 500m section of the 9km KUTA to CANGGU beach strip has only been referred to as DOUBLE SIX BEACH these past few years.Prior, it was simply that section where LEGIAN BCH changes to SEMINYAK BCH ‚Äì abt 3km from the KUTA end. Makes sense: the huge DOUBLE SIX RESORT was not opened until AUG. ‚Äò14.A NEW APPEARANCE ‚Äì I used to cycle KUTA-CANGGU beach in the 80s. Back then, the busy hotel strip would start to peter out in LEGIAN ‚Äì by the time I got to the D6 area there was nothing much in back of the beach ‚Äì just the occasional resort accessed by tracks down from JL LEGIAN inland. How things have changed ‚Äì continuous resorts now extend past D6 to north of SEMINYAK.So D6 BEACH has changed, but what is it like? Well it‚Äôs one of the more popular stretches of sand along this busy strip - because of GOOD ACCESS (Jalan  Arjuna hits the beach here from inland LEGIAN/STH SEMINYAK which have dozens of resorts covering all budgets - and the FABULOUS BEACH CLUBS with their on-sand soft cushions and little tables mentioned in many other reviews. The place is certainly attractive, with lotsa sunlounges for rent and those multi-coloured umbrellas. South of the beach clubs are a host of those local guys selling beer ‚Äì buy from them and you get the plastic chair and table, usually an umbrella and are their friend for life. They often rent sunlounges, surfboards etcMY RATING Normally I would rate D6 Beach ABOVE AVERAGE but for one demerit ‚Äì the open drain that runs below JL ARJUNA exits across the beach: dry season sees just a trickle but wet season can be a torrent.TIPS ‚Äì wet season is not the best time to visit the whole extended beach ‚Äì lotsa rubbish and storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here ‚Äì although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).- those beach clubs: at least 3 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019‚Äôs visit saw the northern-most with at least 1000 people on the sand! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value but too many people for me ‚Äì I went back to the beer guys.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems mid-range to high end. Dozens of places covering all budgets within a 10 min stroll inland via JL ARJUNA.- JL ARJUNA and others similarly have dozens of restaurants from sub-budget up. Wandering food halwkers on the sand can provide some inexpensive yummy stuff as does the guy doing roasted corn foot of ARJUNA.- no shortage of RETAIL THERAPY on ARJUNA and along JL LEGIAN 800M inland (latter has some of BALI‚Äôs better boutiques and furniture/art)- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.SUM UP ‚Äì definitely worth a visit but overall no better than half a dozen other locations along the long extended beach"
Domlea,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2019,The beach and water was the cleanest I've ever seen. The beach is always full of life. It's easy to get a drink or a boogie board.
Peter A,"Somerville, Australia",Jul 2019,"Had dinner and drinks here while watching the sunset. Restaurant was on the beach and the food was delicious.  There are many to choose from. The view was exceptional watching the waves roll in and the sunset was beautiful.  We had the occasional seller walk past but gave them a smile and a no thanks so all was good. A great spot to relax, eat, drink and watch the world put on an amazing display. "
Kimmeikle1990,11 contributions,Jul 2019,Great to just chill out on the beach. Bargain your way to a good deal for a day bed and watch out for the lovely ladies selling items and wanting to braid your hair and rub your feet.
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,"Apart from offering panoramic ocean and beach views, the vibes are pretty good in this beach.You can drink,chill,lazy around ,swim,surf and eat cheap local foods and spent the whole day without care.Must visit for a day to spend."
Michelle C,"Shanghai, China",Jul 2019,I would say it was a nice beach with plenty of options re. Beds and restaurants... some areas were not the most clean but largely in good condition.... felt safe as a solo sunbather... 
422iana,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Jul 2019,The usual as you get there you get asked if you need anything. Nice beach with a lot of surfers in the water.
richathome1,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"A beautiful spot to kick back and relax. Hire a beach chair and umbrella by day then as the sunsets out come the beanbag sofas, cocktails and live music.Probably not the beach for a swim though, surfing is the option here."
The Stoddard,"Sonoma, CA",Jul 2019,"The beach super nice.... there is local food called ‚Äúbakso gerobak biru‚Äù it is indonesian meatball soup with noodles and cabbage... it is delicious.. Eat it with the drink of ‚Äòteh botol‚Äô very good combination! Beach, bakso, teh botol... perfect üëå"
georgec5257,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"There are many, many beach bars where you can enjoy drinks and watch a great sunset. Best times are between 5.00pm and 8.00pm."
Sdhawan61,Noida,Jun 2019,"Was staying very close to 66 beach and went there couple of times. This is more for relaxing and have time for urself. There are many shacks and you can relax on one of these and grab some food, drinks. Good to go there in the evening around 430 5 PM and stay till 730- 8 PM "
Nikita S,6 contributions,Jul 2019,This beach has good waves for surfing. You can find instructors and equipment on the beach for decent price. I paid 200k idr for 2h lesson. Not very suitable for small children as the water is not calm.
catherine w,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Fantastic beach . Bali has really cleaned up its act and its beaches . From sunrise to sunset , the beach is there to be enjoyed . Lots of morning walkers , joggers , swimmers and surfers . During the day you can hire one or two sun lounges and umbrellas for a fee of around $10 for the day . Lots of hawkers but a firm no goes a long way if you dont want to be bothered , then again you may want to barter for a sarong , jewellery , statue , painting , kite , etc as its all fun on the beach . Drinks at sunset on the beach is always a fantastic experience and Sundays is especially crowded with Indonesian families and groups going to the beach to relax or have fun , maybe a game of soccer or a swim , or just a walk along the waters edge . A horse ride at sunrise or sunset is a good thing to do and even if you have never been on a horse before the very experienced stable guys are there to help you and walk a long side your horse so you have no worries of your horse galloping away . There are lots of beach bars from plastic seats on the beach to restaurants with bean bags , lanterns at night and entertainment from sunset . There really is something for everyone."
Dannie S,"Fremantle, Australia",Jun 2019,Beautiful place for casual drinks and eats. Love the lit up beach warungs and beanbags. Only downside is the people walking the beach selling items.
arzaqzidan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,This is definitely one of the must visit place during your stay in bali. It has a great view and calming wave. Great food and drinks (if you choose the right place). A bit crowded but it's the right amount of crowded. And you must see the sunset on this beach it's mesmerizing.
999marianne,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,Good beach to spend time at - rent an umbrella and sunbed from one of the locals (approx IDR 50k for 3 hours); many places for lunch close by and good swimming. The tide is strong  so would advise you to be careful if you're not a strong swimmer. Beach was super clean during my visit. Surfing lessons (and boards) available from local instructors.
Andrea G,"Leeds, UK",Jun 2019,Long beach with many beach bars of varying character and style. Perfect for walks and watching the sunset. When we visited it was very windy so the big waves did not make it possible for anyone to swim. However lots of interesting things to see and do
HugoColle,"Evergem, Belgium",May 2019,"A lovely beach but ofcourse watch out in the sea, theres a strong current and big waves. Ideal to surf thats for sure and alot of places offers you lessons for beginners. The sunset is wonderful, not really crowdy. There is live music in the evening at each bar or restaurant. "
Saurabh Mittal,"Ghaziabad, India",Jun 2019,"Very vibrant yet not very loud. Lots of eating options with comfy beds on the beach. Had a wonderful evening with live bands playing, great food and ever soothing sea breeze!!"
isabelleB120188,6 contributions,Jun 2019,Nice beach next to Kuta and before Canggu area. Definitely for sunsets. I like to watch the waves during daytime from beach bar.
Jolita,7 contributions,May 2019,"It is nice, clean and not overcrowded beach.You can rent sunbeds and umbrellas, have food at local caffee or just grab some drinks.You can swim , do surfing-you can take lessons and rent equipment on beach.We really had great time there.The sunset is amazing there."
tonyholmes61,"Forster, Australia",Jun 2019,Sunsets here are always the best Drinking cold Bintang at Froggies bar siting with great staff & the beach girls watching another great sunset Swim in the warm waters & watching a beautiful sunset is the best
rmalde88,"London, UK",Jun 2019,Lovely clean beach with soft sand. Clear water and big waves. Perfect for children/families. Very lovely in the evening with food restaurants live music and bean bags for people to sit and enjoy.
MLandM,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Most days are half a matter of shore break, not much more. The better days are one and a half metres of clean barrels about 40m off shore, clean and tidy and stretching for two hundred metres or so. The surf (not the beach) reminds me of Noosa barrels. Consistent and smooth.Pretty safe, not much rip, usually a south to north current. Sandy bottom, not rocky or dangerous. A good spot for beginners. Plenty of food and refreshments on the beach, also hire spots for boards, sun beds, etc. The on-beach pubs are good fun with live bands every night. A good place to chill. Fun will be had."
sparky268,"Childers, Australia",May 2019,"Great morning walk area and watch the locals setting up for the day, or go late in the day and join the huge crowds to watch the sunset. Lots of vendors and restaurants to choose from. Really colourful part of the beach, especially around the bars.Good for a chill evening out."
Rich,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2019,"Great to watch the sunset with a massive Mango Daiquiri, but be careful, they make em strong, have no more than 3 or you wont make it off the beach! Good food, pizza's a good choice. All the guys working there really friendly, and some good music played live, good spot"
Janet N,54 contributions,May 2019,"its just something everyone who travels to this part of bali needs to experience at least once. Join the throng of people that flock here to enjoy the sunset. If you're like me and dont go to Kuta this is the place to people watch, wander along the beach in the mornings, enjoy a sunset drink at La Plancha."
David Roy P,"Batemans Bay, Australia",May 2019,"Double Six Beach is a part of the Beach that starts at the Airport and curves along the coast for Miles , It is part of Seminyak and quite different to the Kuta Beach , It is quite wide and dotted with Umbrella's and Lounges and a number of Beach Clubs and Bars . There are a number of Traders selling their Wares , a Surf School and an area for Swimming between the Flags . The sand is not what I would call ""White"" but is quite fine & reasonably Clean (Unlike Kuta ) . The Water was quite warm and is quite clean . Also , certainly not crowded , plenty of room for all ."
bruce b,"Pommard, France",May 2019,one of the very best beach strips on the bali coast for evening sunsets and multi entertainment options
Cynthia,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"The Beach was a place where you can see sunrise and sunset view, flying kite there is a good choice ! Relaxing in the beach with your coconut drink is a perfect moment !"
Ryan,"San Diego, CA",May 2019,"I‚Äôm from Cali so if I was comparing beaches, Seminyak feels like Huntington Beach or those in Santa Barbara but a bit warmer. Water color is the same, a dark green/blue. I was hoping for tortoise blue with white sandy beaches but it was still nice! The chairs with umbrellas is a must in the afternoon otherwise you‚Äôll only last a short amount of time. Pay roughly 100-150k rupiah for the whole day for a pair. If it‚Äôs peak season with most filled, it‚Äôll probably be more. "
Erwin,"Ede, The Netherlands",May 2019,"During the day it's pretty quiet on this beach. For surfing, it would be wiser to go to Kuta beach. The waves there are overal better than here. When the sun sets, the bars on this beach start live music. Good for a chill evening out."
Aaqarsh Aiyyar,"Chennai (Madras), India",Mar 2019,The sand and the waters were clean. The beach is popular for water sports. I relaxed in an evening in this beach and it was a good experience.
putrisabatina,"Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",May 2019,"I like it pretty clean, tourists are great, bikinis are everywhere (it makes you not afraid to wear it!), some dogs walking, barking, playing around, make the beach so lovely."
rellie56,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2019,a lot more needs to be done in regard to rubbish the bars clean there own area but not waters edge used nappies general rubbish still litter beach
Ruth Q,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Lots of cafes, bars, surf schools and music along this stretch of beach. Water and sand were clean. Beaches were well patrolled with plenty of life guards."
Frank G,"West Pennant Hills, Australia",Apr 2019,Walked along this beach once - refused to go back. The beach and the water are full of every type of rubbish you can think of - from plastics and bottles to sewerage waste.  I have no idea how the lifesavers actually swim in it - I consider it an extreme health hazard..
NIC D,France,May 2019,"nice clean beach , easy access, you can have a surf lesson or just rent un umbrella  with deck chair ; you can bathe in the sea ,difficult to swim becaufe of the waves ,but great fun!"
Edgar,35 contributions,May 2019,"Nice flat beach for swimming, great vibe. Lots of beach bars and restaurants to choose from. Surf schools around to learn surfing. Live music at sunset at almost all bars, great sunsets but it gets kinda crowded before sunset. All in all a safe beach with lots of options around."

Natasha Elizabeth,"Halls Creek, Australia",Apr 2019,We spent a week here and enjoyed every day.  My partner surfed while I lay on the beach chairs.  The people are so lovely and it was so relaxing. Great restaurants and ice cold Bintang!
JannieLiu1985,5 contributions,May 2019,"Nice to chill here. Evening time we spent in La Planca cafe,cool music and nice vibe. If you want to swim its not the best option."
WilsonWarner89,"Arvada, CO",Apr 2019,"My wife and i love spending time outdoors here, but it gets really hot really fast, so you need to make sure that you find some shade where you can stash your stuff and relax after your trips into the water. We both loved trying to surf for the first time!"
Cuneyt O,2 contributions,Dec 2018,"We stayed at double six hotel and spent the day time on the beach in front. Very relaxing location. Sea has lot of waves, not for swimming like Mediterranean but good for surfers."
Kartika D,"Kuta, Indonesia",Apr 2019,"On the Double Six beach, Seminyak Bali.This afternoon I sat alone, enjoying a bowl of meatballs and a bottle of Radler.Looking from a distance the surfers are playing with the waves.I want to be like them, when it's bored, it can release the burden on the sea.Thank you God for this beautiful sea, your sunset, I can enjoy it."

buddyrogers32,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,This beach is easily accessible In the morning light waves break on a regular pattern - mostly clean water and beach is cleaned each morning Occasionally ocean water can be littered with rubbish if a storm has taken place previous evening and ends up washing waste into ocean which is not ideal 
Alvilde P,World,Apr 2019,The beach is clean. The only clean beach i have been to in Bali. Nice bars. Good food. Good for party. 
topps,12 contributions,Mar 2019,"We stayed at the double six hotel, so it was easy to walk over to the lovely clean beach, they have their own beach area with deckchairs, towels etc, easy to go for a swim and not worry about your belongings, the beach is cleaned each morning, so a lovely walk after breakfast..along the beach. a great place."
TaherAlbaghliJulian,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Mar 2019,I stayed 4 days in Double Six hotel and I used to visit Double Six Beach after the breakfast when I was there.It clean beach  and it great place to surf or learing surf. Thebad thing about this beach it is not good for swimming  because high waves.
dmacThurgoona,"Benalla, Australia",Mar 2019,"We spent 14 days near to Double Six Beach, and it was a beautiful clean beach , with many restaurants and shopping nearby."
Alan R,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"Early morning the re can be some good fun waves to be had here before the wind picks up. There are always plenty of beach chairs and easy to get a cold drink. The sunsets here are amazing, and there are so many choices to find a table, a bean bag and enjoy the good food and drinks"
Martha B,7 contributions,Mar 2019,"We love that beach for sunsets. You should try to come by 6 PM, find nice cafe with live music band and enjoy sunset time with your lovely ones."
badgranma,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2019,"We made a quick visit this visit as the weather wasn't on our side.  The beach was great, but the water was a little dirty.  We don't swim, but felt it wasn't worth putting our feet in this time."
Dan,5 contributions,Mar 2019,There are less vendors at this part of the beach you will pay a little more for you sunbeds but its well worth it if you dont want to be hassled. 
vicki y,32 contributions,Mar 2019,Situated between Ubud and Sukawati this place was a pleasant surprise. The setting is very romantic and just beautiful. The service was great and the food even better. Enjoyed this place very much.It is also vary close to Bali zoo.Have a great day. üòÅ
leanneandtony,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2019,Is is just another Bali beach. It is fine for a swim and relax under an umbrella.The beach gets cleaned of rubbish every morning and it is patrolled with lifesavers.The hawkers are there but not as bad as kuta. U can hire to sunlounges and an umbrella for 100000 for the day. Beers are cheap 26000 and there are surf schools and board hire.It‚Äôs fine for a typical Bali beach.
Jean L,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,You will be approached for beach chair/umbrella rentals. Rates are for the whole day. Feel free to agree on a price depending on how long you'll be spending there. It can get hot so it's better to go earlier in the day or later in the evening. Surf  lessons are available and boards can be rented as well!
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Mar 2019,Probably the best best in Bali for something to do.Plenty of beachside bars and restaurants that offer up seating and tables.Great place to chill with your favourite beverage whilst watching the sunset.Always a heap of activity happening here.
bellaelisabet,20 contributions,Mar 2019,Its really nice beach to spent time with husband and kid...we love laying on sand while looks kid playing in the sea
boycie13,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2019,I really like this beach it such a nice place and has everything bars along a stretch lots of places to get sun loungers. Surf board hire places with the guys doing lessons and usually selling an assortment of drinks and all I‚Äôve had contact with a really friendly. Lots of life guards. My only small annoyance is the amount of people walking up and down selling an assortment of crap whilst it‚Äôs fun at first can become a bit annoying when you just want to chill and be left alone. But still a cracking place
Hans v,"Goes, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"I.would have prefeered 3,5 stars: sitting here enjoying a cold beer watching the sunset definitely 4 maybe even more stars, the plastic and other rubbish 2 - 2,5 stars. The fact that over the past years more and more effort is being made to clean up swings the score."
Bas F,"Roosendaal, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,It is so nice to be at this beach. The sea offers you nice wa  bes and good swimming.  Lots of bars and restaurants. At sunset you have a very nice sight to watch the sun going under.
Lynette F,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2018,"Great spot to visit and soak up the ambience that is unique to Bali. Friendly service, usually we split a large Bintang bottle of beer which generally costs around $5 but here, like many other tourist bars, only small Bintangs are served, for about $4 each. Still good value, and still good beer, plus good service completes the hat trick."
Jess W,"Ballarat, Australia",Feb 2019,"We chose to meet a minimum spend and sit in an alcove area to the right, after a pre booked party left we moved to the round almost floating area which was as good as it looks in the photos. The food was delicious and drinks menu wide ranging. We would return. "
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"Double six is between Legian and Seminyak beaches. The road behind the beach is open for motorized traffic which means convenient access for people who want to take it easy. There are many restaurants and bars with (loud) live Western style music right on the beach, offering luxury seating and cold beer. At the end of the afternoon it can get crowded as people come to see the sunset. Moreover it is not as hot as during the day.This beach is not a place for peace and quiet seekers."
Alexlostinparadise,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"instead of going to alot of pricey beachclubs, double 6 beach offers a cheap but hipster solution to catching a good sunset with the many cheap beach bars. theres a famous bakso place there which everyone says its good but i havent tried it"
ronan233,33 contributions,Feb 2019,Go there at 5-6 when it‚Äôs little cool you can seat and drink . Very nice beach. Enjoy the sunset .Not overcrowded . 
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2019,"I arrived at double six beach and to my surprise , nothing had changed since my last visit except more plastic. The whole section of beaches from the airport up the coast all have that same horrible trademark - polluted dirty beaches. Shame."
borborbet,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,Nice area of the beach with lots of different options for banana lounges and bar options. Much cleaner area than other parts of the beach in Seminyak
Mike G,26 contributions,Jan 2019,"Went for a morning run on double six beach - endless plastic! So sad. As lovely as the Balinese are, they need to take this plastic problem seriously. Is much worse than the pic shows. "
Eldin Sal E,"Paris, France",Dec 2018,Not for swimming ...but many activities ..can have dinner on the beach in the evening ...with many choices .prices ok
teachsyd95,5 contributions,Jan 2019,The water was warm and definitely felt tropical. The issue was the garbage wrapping around your ankles and neck when swimming. Definitely wouldn't recommend opening your mouth underwater.
Jamie F,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jan 2019,"Spectacular sunsets, cheap (although not always quality) drinks and some tunes of most of the popular covers.Beanbags are great, hagglers can be a touch annoying interrupting conversation but the sunset makes it all worth it.Not a good beach for inexperienced swimmers, vicious shorebreak and often a nasty rip or two- be careful!But the sunset is special and this is a Bali must do"
Mic_Duran,"Manila, Philippines",Jan 2019,"Spend couple hours here with some of my balinese friend such a good idea. Lucky for us, because we still got sunset even rainy season in Indonesia. But it was sunny when we were there."
Pri,2 contributions,Dec 2018,"Beach was not crowded when we went during December 2018. However, the shower facilities after beach activities were not good. There was an old lady who can't speak English for the shower. We faced  lots of problems in having shower there. She can't explain things well."
haqsta,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,"Coming from Oz, where we have so many glorious and clean beaches, many f Bali's beaches don't shine by comparison. Also compared to the clean beaches at Nusa Dua Seminyak falls short. At least the sand is raked every daya nd there is a real community vibe at sunset with many walkers with their dogs (yes as pets!!). The beach bars are not as glam as further up the beach with the immediate options feeling a bit dirty"
wayne j,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,"Looked forward to our walk down Double Six for the first time in ten years but after less than 10 minutes, decided to give it up because of the rubbish and pollution! So sad! What makes it worse, a couple of fires on the sand lit by the locals trying to dispose of what they can! Please visitors to Double Six...say no to plastic bags, straws and disposable cups. Only buy if you can just one BIG water bottle not 5 or six little ones each day and make sure you dont add to the problem!    "
Detritus,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,The beach itself was really good. But it was very crowded.  We easily managed to get beers and chairs set up for us and then just sat back and enjoyed ourselves.There are so many places to eat along the side of the roads and we did try one of them.Getting there took a while due to traffic.
thelonious22,Seongnam,Dec 2018,Double Six Beach few kilometers south was more of the same but with more restaurants and hotels along it offering comfortable seating for payment.  Plenty of surfing instructors were available for those who were brave enough to take a dip in the filthy looking water.
laila,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"There's a lot of rubbish in the water and along the beach unfortunately. You also get approached a lot to purchase street items, for massages and temporary tattoos. Not very relaxing and probably wouldn't go back in the future."
Fckdabck,8 contributions,Jan 2019,"Horrible... Plastic bags and trash everywhere on the beach, am I in Mumbai?The locals do not look after their beach and the results show. Very disappointing. Go further north for better beaches."
E9837BUjohnl,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2018,Amazing on the beach. drinks are perfect and the view is spectacular as well as the food. Great service 
Rory James DOYLE,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2018,TA well rated Double Six Beach has plastic rubbish everywhere. Unbelieveable for a location that depends on tourism. Must be more regular rubbish collection and maintenance.
mav68,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"I stayed at one of the new boutique hotel in Seminyak, obviously hit to the beach is one of the 'must do'. I was very disappointed with the condition of the beach. If it is a 3rd world countries with no international brand presence, I can probably able to accept as I have been to other rural beach area within Indonesia, the 'green effort',  'waste management' and 'CSR' are almost unheard.This is Bali, it appears in the touristy world map.It seems no one bothers, but it does bothers me as a tourist. I have been to Bali easily 25 times in my life, this is the worst I have seen in Bali beaches.Shame to the authority as no good effort has been put in!Shame to the local establishment. Are they not conscious of it at all?Shame to the tourist, if any of tourist has contributed to this mess!Shame to the local, as I has seen many of them are the culprit of litteringShame to the international organisations on the island. Where is their CSR? Helping the poor and unfortunate are important,  but if the fundamentals of cleanliness are not been taking care of, tourism will suffer and the ripple effect can be drastic. I am disappointed. "
Caroline C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Visitors can enjoy beach and sunset. But too bad the beach is really dirty and lots of garbage (plastic bottle, food packages, etc). Really uncomfortable and sad to see. I hope visitors who came here will take care of the environment and please bring along your garbage and throw in the trash can. If not us, then who ?You can see people sit down and enjoy the sunset. Also some people playing soccer. Enjoy the day."
Lynda Brookes,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,What a day at the best beach in Bali. From the friendly surfing teachers to the perfect waves. The atmosphere here is why we came back day after day. 
Juraj,3 contributions,Dec 2018,"We went to Double Six beach yesterday. It is a part of Seminyak beaches and it is ridiculously amazing. Soft sand, no stones or other little pebbles, great waves, that is why everyone is surfing. There were literally five people on the beach ever since morning. It gets a little crowded in the afternoon as everyone gathers to see the most beautiful sunset you will ever see. People who sell you stuff are frequent but a simple No for two-three times will send them on their way and I do not see it as a big problem."
Jarrod M,"Cape Town, South Africa",Nov 2018,"The beach is warm and a great place to surf.  One of my regrets is not taking up the offer of learning to surf.Be ready to be hounded about renting a chair or umbrella or learning how to swim.  The local Balinese are doing their best to make a living wherever possible.  Just be friendly and decline if you're not keen, they will respect your decision."
Jaster N,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,"Crowded beach, nothing special apart from people trying to sell you things and rent you daybed for 100,000k. If you are looking for nice quiet beach, go to Uluwatu instead! This is a touristy beach."
Emma,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2018,"I truly hated Double Six Beach! I have travelled through a number of countries where it's normal to approach passerby's offering goods, and it's never bothered me- i usually enjoy the new experience. But here, it was impossible to walk more than 2 metres down the beach without being hassled to buy sunglasses, shoes etc. We left after five minutes after we got sick of people following us down the beach and one man literally grabbing my partner's arm to try to force him to buy things. Also beware of people trying to scam you into timeshares!"
Black Jack,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"If you are in Bali just visit Double Six Beach at wee hours and you will find this is perfect destination you will remember all life long. As the sun sets the moods sets in, the band plays and couch listeners sipping ginger ale and bintang will soothe the body and mind. There will be some street peddlers peddling all laser gizmos kites and boomerangs. In the morning the white sands and surfing lessons from lifeguards for 300000 an hour is all that you need to live Bali experience at Double Six Beach. You can collect all kinds of conches, corals and most importantly the starfish shells amazing. Relax and have bintang at the restaurants and couches lining the beach from Seminyak Beach to Double Six all the way to Kuta Beach and Beyond. Don't forget to aim the arrow peddled by street hawker at the black pirate kite flying above the white sands. Don't hurt anybody or you will lose your ""License"". My perfect shot was awesome and everyone was gasped as it landed behind the bikini clad lady at double arm's length. ""Do not try this trick at beach"". Disclaimer #BlackJackRapport"
Ron P,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"This beach is the perfect venue for visitors or locals who have guests visiting.  There are countless eateries and you can catch some of the best sunsets you will ever see on those special evening when the clouds, haze, and sun are all just right."
Suzy,2 contributions,Sep 2018,"so many amazing restaurants esp blue 9, lots of shops. we spent 2 nights at this beach. we loved it so much. "
B4962OAbarbaram,Merino,Nov 2018,Wonderful place to see the sunset and have dinner afterwards.  Great food at many of the restaurants.
Jayelle62,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2018,"The beach at double six is not a place to relax, although the sunset here is pretty. (Provided there are no clouds in the pm) but be prepared to be hassled by peddlers trying to sell you sarongs, watches, paintings, kites & jewellery. This might be acceptable if it were only a few of them, but the days I went to double six I was hassled every five minutes by so many of them it became very annoying. I hired a sun lounge, to relax but every few minutes a peddler came. They do not care for your peace & quiet. Even when you say no, the lady peddlers grab your feet and say ‚Äúfoot massage ?‚Äù Several times despite you declining. No personal boundaries. You have to be rude to get them to leave. So for 2 hours I hired a lounge and had no break from them. I don‚Äôt think they understand how many of them come at you. It‚Äôs too much !!! Even when you go to the beach cafes at double six they are allowed in the restaurant while your eating .....to hassle you to buy. Even when your about to take a mouthful of food they come right up. I was trying to be polite ,but it was just too much for me to enjoy my time there.  The food is very average, but the sunsets are lovely. The ocean isn‚Äôt always clean and some plastic and packaging floated past as I swam. There are many surf schools at double six beach but no designated area for them so wherever you swim be prepared for learner surfers to come crashing toward you. Ha ha . Better to go to less popular beaches. Or better still the islands are much nicer. "
adarshjalan,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2018,there place was just 5 min from our SEMINYAK villa.  the place is well maintained. u get a delectable view of flights landing and taking off. lot of options in drinks and finger food . hire an umbrella with a few beach beds  and enjoy your drinks. 
Gill Smith,30 contributions,Jul 2018,What an amazing beach.night time is beautiful and spectacular with music bars food bean bags on beach. Loved it
Ross H,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2018,A lovely beach just walking distance from the Double Six and other reports.  Plenty to see and do along this stretch of coast.
Grace M,5 contributions,Oct 2018,I thought this beach is beautiful. Especially as the sun going down. You are be able to enjoy the spectacles while relaxing in one of many bars which spread out along the beach. After the sun goes down then the music start up with lots of the bars having live bands. It's worth noting that the traffic around here can get very heavy so it can be worth travelling quarter a mile on foot.
Dr. Ayan Das,"Howrah, India",Oct 2018,"Double Six beach is just 10min drive from the Hotel Terrace At Kuta or from legian beach, it's clean and little less crowded than legain and kuta. Sunbeds are quite expensive here as local people are getting more payment from wealthy European people. Otherwise it's nice and Clean but expensive and second best Compare with Nusa Dua beach "
surfoz,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2018,"Although it looked nice and the ocean blue and inviting, there was rubbish strewn along the shore line. The beach is cleaned each day but what a losing battle it is. The dark grey sand is very hot and you will need to run from the street or your deck chair to the water.I did have a swim and tried my best not to touch and floating debris. Nothing like a garbage bag or two wrapping around your legs while swimming.We walked each morning and my wife picked up glass as we did, of course we wore footwear."
Aloysius170,"Sumba, Indonesia",Aug 2018,This black sandy beach is frequented by the youth because they know this area as a 66 club area for night drink and music outing.  But careful undercurrents can be very strong here
Akbar_wibi,"Medan, Indonesia",Oct 2018,At a quick glance its not as busy as the Kuta Beach. It has a relaxing/chill vibe to it. The beach is beautiful & clean. There are also boards to hire for those who is interested. And dont miss the sunset.
lynnel58,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,This beach is always busy along the road. The surf is very rough so not really suitable for swimming l was there in July and no one was swimming and beach was closed but it could have been a result of the earthquake.
David,"Prague, Czech Republic",May 2018,"Perhaps we were just unlucky, but the beach and shallow water were covered with litter, mostly plastic bags wrapping your legs when walking in the sea... locals told us it is garbage from Java island coming with a torrent every now and then. But that made our stay just crap. We had to drive to east coast instead."
Mark B,"Braintree, UK",Sep 2018,"The beach has a fantastic vibe about it, days for relaxing and surfing. Night for a meal and chilling listening to the live music. Finally the sunsets are Awesome and to see so many people watching üåû"
spikethebudgie2013,"Emsworth, UK",Oct 2018,"Loads to do and very tidy beach, lots of bars and restaurants.  Surf lessons by seminyaks local legend."
Garry B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2018,"But heading from hotel to KDT, so had a walk along the beach, amazing sunset, end of the day so not many people around."
Rachel R,"Hahndorf, Australia",Sep 2018,"Warm and inviting, great small waves for beginner surfing. Clear and clean. Loved the water, sand is ok"
Hennie P,"Alberton, South Africa",Sep 2018,"We got to the Seminyak Double Six neach at about 9:00am and as this was in September, there were not tpo much people around....or so I thought.It soon started getting busy enough, fortunately this is a ""forgiving"" beach with enough space.Well appointed beach umbrellas and deck chairs to support a lazy day.Nice water with waves enough for the odd board and body surfing.Cold beers and frech coconot is a waive away......so, what can one say.There are the odd vendor about selling ""Bintang Beer"" towels and also shawls.Not in the shopping mood, then back and neck massages are offered as alternatives.All in all a fun day right up to sunset!"
Kendell E,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"I have been visiting this beach for years. It‚Äôs my favourite. Ozzie‚Äôs Bar is the best. He supplies buxkets with your daybed to rinse your feet after a swim. He and his staff offer great service and now mix cocktails as well. The beach sellers are very friendly, but not too pushy."
Loreyse A,5 contributions,Oct 2018,"Sitting watching the sunset from plastic chairs, drinking Bintang, as supplied by Made, at the southern end of the beach - near Noku Beach house. Watching and joining in the Sunday Soccer matches for People's Day (Sunday), the game ends when the sun is set. Pizza party on the last night, delivered to the beach, super fun!!!"
Pink P,Florida,Sep 2018,"A bit disappointing to be honest.  The sea was very rough with a very strong current pulling us back out.  The sand just looks dirty, although I understand that's because it's partly volcanic - but it just looks grey.  And with the metal particles in it, it was blisteringly hot - impossible to walk on without sandals.  There were the usual vendors hawking sunglasses, kites and string/bead ""jewelry"".  Definitely not the typical tropical beach I was expecting - those seem to be on the East side of the island."
Edith NB,"Veracruz, Mexico",Sep 2018,"I‚Äôd definitely recommend to wait for the sunset in this beach. Also, there are many places to enjoy near to it. "
Vinay S,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018,"Double Six Beach is basically a twin brother of Seminyak Beach. They are so identical and close that if you walk a bit from Seminyak to the left, you won't even realise when you have arrived at Double Six, and vice versa. "
Denise B,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2018,"Nice waterfront location, good paths to stroll along and soak up the busy atmosphere. Heaps of eating places catering to all needs, good vibes, lots of music in the evenings, very pretty all lit up, great happy hours!"
lozz c,2 contributions,Sep 2018,"Nice to sit and have a drink, but a lot of plastic on the beach and in the water. Can get a bit noisey at times. Lots of bars and good eateries around."
Christopher M,5 contributions,Aug 2018,"A full on beach for entertainment, bars, cafes, live music & djs' great sunset views and comfy bean bags for a Bintang or four!!"
sharron132017,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,Visited every day while in Seminyak.Love sitting on the beach having a drink  under an umbrella or on beach lounge.Also great cafes with good food.
Monika D,"London, UK",Apr 2018,"Double Six Beach is a popular place in Seminyak. I was a bit disappointed when we arrived because there was a lot of plastic waste on the beach and in the water as well. Later we found out it was because of a storm 2 days ago, the waves brought the garbage out from the deeper places of the ocean. The next day the plastic was gone so we could start to enjoy our holiday. The beach has a good atmosphere overall with lots of beach bars/restaurant with live music every evening. The food is nice in every restaurant and cheap. Is a nice beach for surfer with some good waves but for people who are looking for more relaxing holiday I would recommend different beaches: Nusa Dua, the beaches on Gili Islands (with white sandy beach+turquoise water,perfect for snorkelling)"
Tony G,"Winchester, UK",Aug 2018,"Great place to chill out, have a few bintangs, and watch the sunset. Plenty to do and some great beach front bars."
Slldcl,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Fabulous hotel that makes you feel like a Queen or King. Soo luxurious great views, amazing breakfasts plus delicious dinners."
Susana A,"Viseu, Portugal",Aug 2018,"Amazing place, great food, very nice staff. An amazing spot to spend a full day at the beach relaxing and doing some water sports."
p4pranjal,"Surat, India",Aug 2018,"A very good beach. Clean. Nice sunset view. This beach is not recommended for swimming. The water current is high. Good place to spend time. Local beer, coconut and food available."
msb444,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2018,"The beach is black sand and more of a surfing beach.  Not good for swimming, snorkeling or for small kids as the current is strong and the waves are big.  If you like to sunbathe, the shore is spacious and kept clean.  Nice for walking casually along the shoreline or even jogging."
bcheong,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2018,"Stayed at the indigo and this is the public beach that several hotels in the area share. Not too crowded but still lively enough. About $20 per sunbed per day, half day rates available. Plenty of restaurants and cafes "
Adrianus H,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2018,"First time to be here, the beach is beautiful with mid wave/tide and soft and clean sands. There were lot of cafe providing seats facing the beach. It‚Äôs free access to the beach, some hotels even giving free shuttle services to visit here."
lordmair,london,Jul 2018,"This is a very nice stretch of beach where the waves are a lot less fierce and hence very good area to learn body surfing or actual surfing.  Some quite nice restaurants like Gado Gado and La Plancha along the back, and generally a relaxed vibe."
WestAussiechick7,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018,"Visiting Double Six will definitely not be boring!If people aren't trying to sell you paintings, beer, watches,kids toys, sarongs, necklaces ... the list goes on,  then you can learn to surf or have a drink and some cheap bites at one of the bean bag beach bars!These bars are a place you MUST visit at sunset when in Bali. The beers are cheap and the live music creates a fun but relaxed atmosphere"
863rods,"Newcastle, Australia",Aug 2018,The surf at this beach is often rough with large dumping waves. However many people enjoy just sitting on the beach drinking bintangs.
Brookfield G,"Churchdown, UK",Aug 2018,"This beach is a fun spot to watch sunset ,lots of colourful bars and although there is some plastic rubbish at least Doyble Six seem to be trying to get on top of the litter unlike Kuta "
Richard H,"Hemel Hempstead, UK",Sep 2017,Can get very busy. Beachside restaurant served excellent food. Great way to watch the sun setting at the close of another fantastic day in Bali. Nice beach but as with a lot of beaches in Bali there is a lot of litter around. Great for a family day out and worth the visit. 
khanhninge,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018,"I have stayed at Double Six Hotel, Anatara and The Haven and always drawn back to this beach for it vibrant atmosphere, good surf and clean. Great location for shopping and good restaurants."
cassie l,"London, UK",May 2018,"Me and my partner stayed at the double six hotel for 10 nights, we couldn't recommend this hotel enough! We loved the Hermes toiletries which was provided in the room and the butler ironing your clothes each evening. The breakfast was best we've ever had staying at hotel and had plenty of healthy options. The steak restaurant was out of this world would defiantly recommend. The staff was really friendly and would do anything to assist."
DrMedhat,KSA,Jul 2018,public open free beach. good for surfing or observing the sunset.alawys crowded. Not suitable for swimming.
Max C,"Phillip Island, Australia",Aug 2018,"Popular for viewing the sunset with tourists. Somewhat dirty beach, although the and is black, it is the continual rubbish washing up each day that is putrid.  It is cleaned daily, and I think this beach supplies much of the plastic we find in our oceans!  Many bars are also present, this is a classic Bali beach. Enjoy but be aware! "
ŒîŒ∑ŒºŒ∑œÑœÅŒπŒøœÇ Œú,"Corinth, Greece",Aug 2018,We are from Greece and we are really habitual in other kind of beaches.I don t like it so much. Is good only for serfers. It s not suitable for children. 
Ingrid T,12 contributions,Jul 2018,Great beach for a swim or to sit and soak up the atmosphere. It is popular for surfing lessons and kite flying. Be prepared to be approached by hawkers selling their wares. Great place to sit and have a drink or a take a beach walk to Kuta or Seminyak or watch the kite flying or surfing lessons take place.
denisevv20,"Birmingham, UK",Jul 2018,"the beach is busy with sun beds, umbrellas and vendors. we enjoy looking at the big waves and surfers riding the waves is also good for beginners they have many surf schools in the beach you can choose from,  very nice to stay for the sunset when they change the atmosphere and set all the colorful beanbags and umbrellas music and ights with cocktails, we enjoyed. "
Gwen A,17 contributions,Aug 2018,This is a surf beach so no really my thing.But it is lovely. Lots of bars along the beach and Double Six serves its clients well here. Very close to the hotel amd easily accessible.
177graemes,Salamanderbay,Jul 2018,"if you like people watching this is the place for you. Watching the sunset from your beanbag on the beach is a must at Double 6 Beach. The beanbags are cheap to hire, you can buy drinks and food and have in your beanbag. The beach is clean. The locals selling their wares are good fun to barter with.watch the incoming tide though! Need to get there early to get a good seat."
Sanjeev Ohri,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018,loved the place. best place to go with kids and even solo as this place have good eateries and the beach is very clean
AriefLatif,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"Good beach to hang out and learn to surf.  Lots of street vendors, must pay for lounging chairs but very affordable.  Waves is good for beginner. No lifeguard was seen so be mindful of unattended kids."
sjreviewer,"West Berlin, NJ",Jul 2018,"Unlike the famed Jersey shore, the sand on this beach is not burning hot. You can rent umbrellas and chairs every few feet for 5-15$. There are dozens of bars and a lot of interesting Australians and Englishmen to talk to. The only downside is that you are approached several times an hour from people trying to sell you anything from popsicles to sunglasses, to bracelets, to kites, to toys, to saris. The waves were great and there were many places to get surfing lessons."
virtueleighanne,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Another experience viewing the sunset on the beach along with hundreds of others. Great setup with beanbags and umbrellas and food service .Staff were excellent and friendly. Enjoyed the hawkers selling their wares. A job not for the faint hearted ! Very friendly and tireless in their objectives.
Sk M,8 contributions,May 2018,This is one of the beutiful beaches situated in seminyak of bali. You can find some luxurious hotels nearby the beach with the beach view.Best time to visit is during sunset.And after that just chill out at the restaurants fully lighted on the beach shore with pleasent music.
harris0nes,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2018,Nice sunsets. Plenty of beach chairs to hire. Unfortunately the wave are strong at the moment and be careful!
Dianne,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Jul 2018,"Great to hang out at but there are A LOT of vendors that repeatedly came up to us, over and over again, even after we said no thank you. The water was pretty rough and we had to move our chairs but overall we had a relaxing time sitting on the beach for a reasonable price. "
josephine,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,beautiful beachlooking at the beauty of the beach while enjoying pure coconutand see new surfers learning surfing
Carole M,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018,"The beach is lovely and clean  , soft gentle waves makes it ideal for first time surfers. Hire a surf board or a boogie board at a very inexpensive rate , have one of the happy go lucky Balinese boys show you how . As the sun sets stroll on the beach and relax while having a Bintan...."
Rusky6,"Shepparton, Australia",Jul 2018,Head to Mose for great service if you want a surfing lesson or want to hire a board. The guys here are great. My 10 year old son and I did a lesson and were catching waves in no time. We came back the next day as well. We came back a third time but the waves were pretty big and the conditions not ideal for my son so they said to us that it probably wasn't the safest day for him to surf. This was much appreciated as they could have quite easily taken our money and we would have been none the wiser. You'll find them on the beach just next to the Haven beach chairs. Well worth it.
Jyu005,"Tokyo, Japan",Jul 2018,Went there with my girlfriend and spend a couple of hours here. Local people are so friendly and they offered some stuff with reasonable price. Worth to visit.
Sameer P,"Ulm, Germany",Jun 2018,It‚Äôs been a fun evenings in double six beach. I love the restaurants with bands and fire dancers are awesomes. Drinks beers or full bottle drinks as they dilute your drinks with water.
Jashy80,"Volendam, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"On our honeymoon in June/July '18 my wife and I stayed at Double Six Beach, being a surfer I checked out various surf schools along the beach and after a great talk with Wayan, me and my wife booked a private session at his surf school. My girl got great guidance and was standing up in the first hour, big smile on her face!Being more experienced, I got great instructions on improving my form and technique, I've been back for more the whole vacation. Next to having a solid team, good guidance, Wayan is an amiable guy with great knowledge on surfing, the island and Bali culture.When you visit Seminyak, even if you have never surfed before, I can highly recommend Wayan for a splendid time on the water!"
Frank J,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,Nice and clean beach with surfing and surfing schools available.  Plenty of the usual coffee shops and day spas available
Lizelle S,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jun 2018,"It's great for beautiful sunset pictures,  but I hated the atmosphere.  Each restaurant places different music and want play their music louder than the next one. So way to much sounds and people. If your a party animal, then I'm sure you'd enjoy the nights there, but it's definitely not a relaxing beach."
Paige L,"Croydon, UK",Jun 2018,"After reading some of the reviews on here I wanted to write my own purely to point out how lovely this beach is. Yes it is crowded but the beach is huge and we had an amazing time. We first went for the sunset, beautiful atmosphere. My partner clearly thought so as he proposed whilst there. We came back the following day and spent the day there, the sea is for surfing (not for swimming really) my partner done a surfing lesson and enjoyed that and we rented out 2 sunbeds and an umbrella for 4 hours. This was ideal really. I would highly recommend visiting the beach.  "
Lara V,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Jun 2018,"Stunning views, lots of restaurants to choose from, the ocean is warm and gentle. At night it turns into an outside feast for the eyes, everyone is sitting on the beach front drinking cocktails listening to music and watching the fireworks :-) Loved it!"
Erich H,"Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2018,"Came here with my family (3 adults, 4 children ages 7, 6, 4, & 1) almost every day of our 9 day stay in Bali and we didn't stay in this area.  We came here our first day on a recommendation from a friend and decided to come every day after that.  The beach is clean and has great water for kids and adults alike.  We were able to rent surfboards and beach chairs cheap every day.  My wife and I had visited some other beaches during the afternoon and found that this beach was really the best."
Three Sixty Guides,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"people are sometimes disappointed by the beaches in Seminyak, the sand is dark owing to the volcanic nature of the island. However, the long, wide beach is much more than simply a place to play by the beach. It's a place to meet the locals, do some shopping, surf, body board, play beach volleyball, eat, drink, get a massage and soak up the sun. there is always something happening, it's a slice of the Bali life."
crazytraveller123,"delhi, india",Jun 2018,"nice clean beach which is spread for almost a few kms. many sun beds and also has many famous beach clubs and restaurants like cocoon, la plancha etc. best place to learn surfing / swim / dip and enjoy a beer. "
liztrev8,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jun 2018,"Warm water, small waves to dumping surf,  but this is the best beach location in the area in our view, and the locals are very friendly.Enjoy a double lounger and umbrella for the two of you for 100,000 Rp or $10 Australian for the day and ice cold beer for $2:50Regardless of where you are you will experience the local peddlers trying to sell you anything they can. But be polite as this is their  living  but be aware that they will return multiple times so just ignore them and they will move on. Dogs are everywhere but seldom a problem and the beaches are regularly cleaned although plastic  bags and other rubbish can be evident at different times.Enjoy a leisurely stroll to and from Kuta and take in the holiday atmosphere. As it‚Äôs currently school holidays here  there are multiple kites in the air. It‚Äôs a great spot. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we are."
matthewoliver0101,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,It was pretty similar with Seminyak Beach since it was all connected but it has really comfy chairs where you can rent and enjoy the sunset while relaxing.
ammaus n,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2018,"The beach is great fmto walk along between Kuta and Seminyak but irs sad to see the extent of rubbish and human impact on the area, especially if you arrive at sunrise before the local volunteers clean the shore... not the cleanest ocean water either, and rough waves but still overall a lovely beach in Bali to wander down."
Nupur U,19 contributions,Jun 2018,Clean and beautiful beach with all the eatries nearby. Located in the middle of seminyak this beach has nice decent crowd as well
Nishank,Delhi,May 2018,"I went to B9B on a weekday evening, and boy was I impressed. The ambience, the people, the servers, and the entertainment everything fits like a piece of one jigsaw puzzle. Beachside Restaurants are moderately priced, so a visit won't hurt your pocket much."
mulletmason,"Thornlands, Australia",Jun 2018,"We stayed in Seminyak for 5 days and we walked to this beach a few times during our stay.It has the usual hustle and bustle for chairs, surfboards and whatever else the ""walkers"" have to offer, so don't be scared to try and haggle a price that doesn't upset your budget. First day we got some been bags on the beach for free with a few beers, then moved down towards Kuta and got a surfboard and 2 chairs for however long we wanted for 100.000IDR. It was mine and my wife's first time trying to surf, and we really enjoyed it. I didn't stay out too long as a have a sore shoulder, but for the short while I was out it was great fun. I'm by far an expert of surfing, but if you are going to give it a go, it is definitely a great spot to try. Pick your spot and your set as big and small waves come and go quite frequently. Can see why a lot of surfers enjoy coming here.The ""walkers"" will probably get on your nerves after a while, some actually tell you to pay them to leave, but that's Bali for you!Great beach and would recommend a visit and a surf!"
Cam0909,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,"As this spot is the closest to our stay in Seminyak, it was easy to get here. We arrived about 1.5hour before sunset and the weather was really nice that day, with strong breeze. I prefer here vs Kuta beach for sunset as is less packed and there are some cafes along the beach for drinks or meals."
Sowen100,"Naples, Italy",May 2018,"We stayed here for four nights in May 2018 and chose this hotel because of it location on the beach and seemingly high rating. This hotel has a great pool, lovely roof top bar, serves a great breakfast and had the friendliest staff. Our issue was with the rooms. The air con in the room which we were given initially stank the room out (we noticed this when we returned to the room in the evening a were greeted by the pungent stench of mildew and dampness). It was almost unbearable and coupled with this were the very damp bed sheets. The next day, following our complaint, we were moved to a new room which didn‚Äôt smell on a higher floor. Looking back at some of the reviews on Tripadvisor it seems the air con issue has been going on for over 3 years so I really don‚Äôt know why it hasn‚Äôt been resolved. "
Tania S,"Dunedin, New Zealand",May 2018,"Acro the road from our hotel, several casual cafes on the beach... all playing music and great value for money"
Chevalian,"New Forest National Park Hampshire, UK",May 2018,"To be honest. theres not a great deal to chose between the three - Double Six, Legian, and Kuta beaches. You may as well choose the most convenient for your hotel location. After all, they are really all just one ultra long beach which you can walk the entire length of without interruption, division into three sections is arbitrary. But for me Double Six has the edge because the beachfront restaurants and bars here are more to my taste, I reviewed B9B (Blue Nine Beach restaurant) elsewhere on here. Some take credit cards, some don't, best to ask first. Sunshades, loungers, cold beers brought to you all day by whichever vendor ""owns"" the spot you have settled in, what more can you want? Of course there are always the hawkers selling anything from ice creams to dodgy watches, but not as persistent as Kuta Beach. Despite some reports, the sea is not always good for surfing and the sunsets are not always spectacular, so if these are your focus of attention you may be disappointed. But thats true for the whole coast."
gobigsal,"Bicester, Oxfordshire",May 2018,"Difficult to find a spot where there isn‚Äôt loud music being pumped out of the speakers from one of the many bars. Gets really busy at sunset as everyone seems to come out for the spectacle. Plenty of comfy sun beds & umbrellas to rent at 100,000 rupiah each or $10 AUS. Possible to negotiate with some places. Sea looks great with lots of surf but red flags all along indicating dangers. Doesn‚Äôt seem to stop swimmers & surfers. There is at least one life guard. Sand is really very fine volcanic dust that sticks to everything."
Joanne S,3 contributions,May 2018,"Double six beach is somewhere we have visited all 3 trips to bali!   We often go to Zanzibars for a dinner meal, then head down the beach to grab a drink on bean bags and watch the musical entertainment at one of the beach bar type places.  Often you will see fireworks, or lanterns floating away in the sky, which is nice!  The only downside to double six beach is that there is many, many people trying to sell you things (watches, toys, sarongs, etc) and it can get a bit annoying sometimes.  They are often very friendly, but sometimes persistent and it makes me feel a little bad knocking people back all the time.  Worth it though.  Brilliant at sunset.   I actually proposed to my other half a few years back on this beach!  "
TaraKapur,"Mumbai, India",May 2018,My son got an instant surf lesson here and was able to surf! lots of public toilets some with showers. We could sit on sun beds (on payment) and get drinks from the vendors passing by. clean beach! 
Jules65Brisbane,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2018,"There are plently of cafes on the beach with bean bags and live music, best enjoyed around 6pm onwards.  It's always a great way to relax for a couple of hours watching the sun set and having a couple of beers."
Poery B,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"less crowd than Kuta, with same beautifulness to Kuta. white sandy beach, low and mid tide, good for training surfing "
balimamma,"Ubud, Indonesia",May 2018,"this beach is lovely for surfing and spending a day but it gets very tiring to keep telling all the vendors no. They sell everything, paintings, watches, glasses, fruit, toys, dvd. I would be surprised if one of them comes by with furniture. Good sunbeds with drinks and boogie or surf boards available."
ABajwa01,"Greater London, UK",Mar 2018,Long beach to walk along but there is quite a lot of litter but lots of places to eat with live singers and these outlets have a great vibe. 
Emille B,10 contributions,May 2018,"We went to Double Six Beach for the sunset.  We were excited to spend our last evening in Bali watching the sun fall beneath the horizon.  As with all things in the Kuta area, shops outnumber everything but the stray dogs.  Just know, if you go by foot, you'll have to say ""no"" about a hundred times.  However, the biggest disappointment was how the natural beauty of this beach and those waves were spoiled by the trash and general lack of cleanliness.  That's what really hurts, because we've been around the world before and seen high traffic areas and never seen a beach that had such natural beauty so spoiled by man-made, preventable debris.  It was just everywhere and overwhelmed our opportunity to be in the moment.  Though the clouds obscured our direct view, we wanted to stay in the moment, but surrounded as we were by the trash, it was hard to engage fully.  Even as we went to a bar to sit and have a cocktail, the uncleanliness just followed through.  The beach chairs were stained terribly, if I were a business owner, I'd offer a towel to patrons who would like one, I know we would have used it (the stains were irrespective of the beach bar, which were often placed right on the sand).  We left Bali a bit disappointed that they haven't managed their naturally beautiful space carefully, leaving it to tourists, vendors and stray dogs to manage the trash instead of making an effort to keep the area pristine. PS:  the waves are absolutely beautiful, if you want to surf or splash, I see no reason not to here."
Ilina B,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"This was the closest beach from my hotel. Plenty of coffee shops, street vendors and sun lounges available along the beach. Not the cleanest beach, but from what I could read rubbish is a common problem for most of the Bali beaches."
Audrey R,5 contributions,May 2018,I stayed at The Haven hotel which was 15 minutes walk away from the beach. There are many bars along the beach with colourful beanbag chairs for people to sit and look at the amazing sunset view.
Bel C,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"We visited this beach in May. The surf was consistent, smooth and decent size waves for Seminyak Bali. Although sandy compared to neighbouring island like Lembongan it was good for down town Seminyak "
Xmxmm,"Tweed Heads, Australia",May 2018,Was looking for a relaxing day by the beach but was swarmed by sellers as soon as we sat down and was constant all day 
kingofpeppange,"Peppange, Luxembourg",May 2018,"Large - and very long beach !It is not very crowded (at least it was not when I was there !Ideal for longer walks , and you might discover some Australian females sunbathing topless..."
Tambonz,"Waipu, New Zealand",May 2018,"Nice beach a bit spoiled by the VERY numerous traders who ply you with sunglasses, jewellery and deck chairs CONSTANTLY ....not as much as in Kuta Beach but it does spoil the mood a bit."
hermankamsani,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,"It's a long stretch sandy beach of Kuta-Seminyak. Get the best view at one of the bar beside the beach with live performance. There's alot of Bar to choose, so get the one that  great live performance, view and sunbeds. Sea breeze was awesome!!!"
ind3ra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"Mind you, the sand is black/darker shade. So, it's not like those pretty beach you see in the magazine. There's still very visible trashes everywhere (I guess they try to clean it recently.)"
madre&padre,Montenegro,May 2018,This beach is part of Kuta-Seminyak long 4 km sandy beach. Water is clear withnot too big waves. You can hire many of sunbeds and chair or take place in some good beach bar like K-Resto!
Anita E,"East Molesey, UK",Apr 2018,"Sat down for a beer and a group of ladies came offering massage which my daughter and I had and enjoyed, then tried selling us more items, I enjoyed this but you must get the prices down to what you want to pay..good experience , nice beach."
Hayley L,"Innisfail, Australia",Dec 2017,"Totally loved sitting on beanbags, listening to some very cool local musicians, sipping Bintangs, watching the glorious sunsets..what else could you ask for after a big day of site seeing? "
danben24456,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Apr 2018,Excellent  restaurant and roof top bar great food.plantation restaurant was excellent.service was really excellent.
Clark Kenneth,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"been here from 4pm and we enjoy the place, at 5pm  they have live band and it was amazing, the vibe is really great and we can drink beer and enjoy the afternoon vibes with the live band. incredible!"
kimmytan2016,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Apr 2018,"A lot more cleaner than kuta beach, and their sunset is truly beautiful. Although it is a bit far (not walking distance but can take Grab and it is quite cheap), the beach is wide and clean, the sunset is beautiful."
dkseaman,3 contributions,Apr 2018,"Sit by the beach on chairs or bean bags... service comes to you with music and bands playing in the background, well priced foods and drinks and a great way to watch the sunset"
Sandie H,"Greater Perth, Australia",Mar 2018,"Staying here for a month I often visit this beach. The time of the year makes a big difference to this beach. From January to March during the rainy season the beaches are very dirty. Lots of wood, coconuts float in but the worst part is floating plastic. So much plastic . The water is fabulous anytime and from April on the beaches and water get cleaner due to lack of rain. In July and August usually very clean. Lots of chairs and beanbags and in the evening, music, fireworks, food and Bintang. Great place to socialise and watch the sun going down. "
The Walking Critic,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,Bali is a volcanic island so the sands are never going to be the bleached white grains you find in other holiday destinations. I loved my morning and evening walks before the sun makes it too oppressive to be there. I have to say it was totally clean every time I was there and I did have a dip in the water which was lovely. 
cirque,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"You will never get bored when you visit DoubleSix beach, notable by sun loungers dotting up the beachside with AirAsia umbrellas, when you walk towards Kuta side to the South, you can see some cages with colourful umbrellas and bean bag chairs. Perhaps the most popular one is La Plancha, but others are following the trend. The sand on the beach is a bit dark in colour but overall it's soft sand. "
Rasha Y,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,"One of my fev beach. Very clean ,good ppl Threre is a guy called nyomy he is a good teacher in suffering i learned from him  üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èit was great experience "
TheLaskers,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2018, Our first time here beautiful beach very clean hired chairs great spot . It was very close to our villa to walk great cafes and restaurants on beach .Service brought to you.
Christine,New York,Apr 2018,"Double Six Beach definitely has a nice view, but it is not a beach for laying out and spending time by the water. Better to sit at a restaurant on the beach to watch the sunset. Sand is dirty."
kayla b,27 contributions,Apr 2018,Awesome beach for sunsets and relaxing on beanbags with table service waiters and lots of live music The water is pretty disgusting so not good for swimming 
Mohan A,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Apr 2018,One of the best places in Kuta to witness the sunset in the evening. Many beach restaurants with bean bag seating and candle lights.Not very expensive but not cheap too.Can recommend this place for a relaxing evening.
Stewart A,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"As far as one can see.   Maybe   2 kms in each direction depending on ones   eyesight.  Waves.  Crisscrossing Waves   coming from the left and right for miles.   And  thousands of  surf  students    .  schools.   and   moderate  waves for the  Balinese  show offs having fun.     Rent a  reclining chair    and   just watch the show.    For a Canadian   ,  Surfing is   really cool.     Exhilirating.    im  talking about watching  not doing. ha ha ha.    Double Six  beach at night is party  time.   Sunset view.    magnificent.     The water here is   safe to  wade into.  all sand.     and shallow despite the  waves.  There was no undercurrent  at this time.    Thousands of students  learning to surf.  very safe."
hopefulalice,"Hope, Canada",Mar 2018,"Save your money and go to a beach that is not covered in garbage and dog excrement! It is crowded & dirty & when you swim, you are hit with garbage! "
Denise,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2018,"I was actually looking forward to the beach in Bali after hearing so many good things about it. Unfortunately, plastics and rubbish are everywhere and I wish the locals and tourists can do their part in preserving the beach and ocean. I have plastics tagged on my leg while walking along the beach. The local has been trying to clean it up, but it really does take greater effort in this. It's really sad to see this. Please, dont throw any rubbish and pick up the rubbish if you see any, you cant do much but little effort goes a long way."
Cecilia D,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,"This beach was such a disappointment. I asked and it seems like some months out of the year there are some currents bringing all the garbage to the beach. They clean it in the morning but you have more coming in during the day and at night is disgusting, you cannot even go for a nice walk. The waves are great if you are into surfing and there are some great bars and restaurants with live music. If I new the beaches were like this I would‚Äôve stay somewhere else. I recommend you to check the beach before you rent a place or book a hotel."
Piunti2013,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,"Double Six Beach is super busy with people walking down to the beach, scooters & honking taxis. There's plenty of places to eat & drink & just watch the Amazing sunsets. Loads of colorful beanbags & pretty umbrellas to sit under. Walking along the beach down towards Seminyak is fine & feels safe, there are so many people walking about taking photos. Amazing sunsets, no filters needed. Recommend."
Abdulla C,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"Double Six is a pretty happeninng beach. I am probably biased because i lived like 5 minutes from it when i was there - but hey great beach is a great beach! Fun people, fun watering holes, and a bunch of activity abuzz."
Kaztravels74,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2018,"Loved it, very clean for our visit. Great bars etc along the beach. Clean all the way to Kuta. Also walked the opposite direction to main Seminyak and found main Seminyak beach filthy, covered in rubbish and barely anyone on the beach. Double 6 to Kuta loads of people but plenty of places to sit and relax."
Deborah C,"St Marys, Australia",Mar 2018,Beautiful sunset...stunning a must to see....food excellent people outstanding.....plenty of markets nearby ....kids will love this place .great for a stop for a drink or two
_bay_lucas,"Olinda, PE",Mar 2018,"Beautiful beach to enjoy the sunset, presents an exotic scenery here. Access is also easy close to the center of the crowd. If you start the afternoon many restaurants and pubs that open here, can to relax and enjoy the sunset."
havingfunagain,"Cambridge, MA",Mar 2018,Very nice beach. Wonderful warm waters with many chairs and umbrellas to choose from. There is a cost. Just a not: they do try to clean it up in the a.m. for there is much rubbish that comes from the sea and other parts of Indonesia.
sandeep k,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2018,"The beach was very crowded. It was not clean as well, a lot of plastic bags/cans thrown around. Better go to simniyak beach (near anantara hotel), it's closed by and much better than double six."
Peter L,9 contributions,Feb 2018,"The beach is very busy and noisy with everything it comes with it. Sellers of everything, guys that force you to rent a sunbed or surf and a lot of different music styles from bars that are just few meters from each other."
monika a,9 contributions,Mar 2018,"this beach will very crowded in the afternoon especially before sunset. if you want to go to this beach, please prepare 1 hour before the sunset time (you can check the sunset schedule in the internet). if not, you cant find the parking lot (if you bring car) or you cant find a good place to enjoy the sunset time :Dbring you friends here, just sitting on the beach while drinking dan chatting with your best friends. :)"
BG01,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2018,Relax with beach beds and umbrellas all day. Friendliest locals go out of their way. You can get great nase gireng cooked fresh on the beach and drinks brought to your chair
janacb47,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2017,"Average but nice for swimming. Good for bargain shopping out of deckchair, not having to move. Loved the Balinese people so friendly and happy."
Liz M,"Canning Vale, Australia",Mar 2018,If the afternoon is clear and not overcast head down for an amazing sunset.Grab a beanbag and enjoy a beverage or a meal  (or both) and people watch as you watch the sun go down.Most places have live music and the food is generally okay.Seminyak beach is cleaner than the Kuta area.Great spot to get some romantic photos.Just be prepared to be asked to buy a number of things from hawkers while you sit. And if you say yes to one be aware word gets out üòé
Irina P,9 contributions,Mar 2018,Amazing beach especially in the evening for the sunset watching.A lot of restaurants with good food :).
505SaadNafai,8 contributions,Mar 2018,Nice place to chill out with friends all day long In the evening you can enjoy the live music bands playing front off the beach restaurants while having drinks or food..the improvement of that place is on the shoulders of the municipality who should have a real impact about cleanliness of the seminyak beaches ... Also I have been in Jimbaran side the beaches over there are really sorry.. The fish market in jimbaran need a lot of improvement.. Saad Nafai
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,The water is thick with garbagd. I mean you wade through it. This is so thick now you will be covered in nappies and plastic n rubbish. Balis beaches are now the most polluted in the world.The rubbish piles up on the beach its horrible. This has been getting worse every year but the Indonesian government does nothing.
trippie784,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"The beach is the most time clean, but after a rainy day is it dirty on the beach. Sand not white but plenty of beach lazy boys to rent if you want."
theCheeseFamily,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,clean beach..nice sunset..lovely beach..good for relaxing..no lights when night time..short distance to shops/restaurants/bar..
614allany,"Durban, South Africa",Feb 2018,"We visited this beach area on a Thursday around 10 am.There was not much happening, with very few beach goers. The local ‚Äúmerchants ‚Äú were relentless and made the morning very frustrating to try and relax.There was a lot of plastic debris coming onto the beach from the sea, making the beach seem dirty and untidy. Some locals kept their areas tidy but the overall pollution was disappointing. Not a beach we would choose to revisit."
gensivalingam,"George Town, Malaysia",Feb 2018,The place was to busy and the beach need to be more organized and cleaned up for me which can be improved
Brenda0913,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"The beach was filled with litter and garbage, the sea and sand is  Greyish and we were there for  5 min and headed straight back to our villa."
I Gede A,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"Bali holiday.. Wow double six beach seminyak, got your relax through breeze and laying under the sun will change your skin become brown funtastic, Ready to assist you, please call us +6281999529816"
Keith R,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,"With heaps of different beach bars to choose from, from La Plancha at the north end down the Franks Bar Dreadlock Maker at the Legian Southern end.All with a vast array of local characters, vendors and ice cold drinks.With new toilets being build, little beach warungs popping up and all the restaurants nearby, it's easy to see why lunch turns into sunset drinks."
Jo B,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018,"What was once, I'm sure, a pristine beautiful surf beach is now covered in plastic litter. It floats in on the waves and lies deposited all over the beach. The Balinese culture just wasn't prepared for the plastic that the demands of western tourists required. For years there were no bins, because in Balinese culture food was carried in banana leaves and containers made of palm leaves, all of which composted down and went back into the soil. They didn't need bins. Now there are bins for the plastic but the residue is evident all over Bali, particularly on its main tourist beaches near Kuta. If you want clean white sand on pristine beaches, go to Australia."
Tesremos,"Bristol, UK",Feb 2018,This beach is probably more for the surfers than for the sun seekers. There were many pop-up bars but unfortunately there were large piles of rubbish and driftwood at bout 50m intervals along the sandy beach. Whether this was a short-term rubbish collection problem or the norm is not known but other reviews say much the same.
Lorraine C,"Worcester, South Africa",Feb 2018,"Dont expect Bali beaches to live up to the expectations in your head. The beach was filled with litter and garbage, the sea and sand is greyish and we didnt even sit down for a drink but headed straight back to the villa. Also, there were dogs making poo's on the beach and the owners didnt  bother to pick it up (dont think there are rules about it). Not worth visiting at all."
Keenan K,16 contributions,Feb 2018,"Covered in as much litter as every other beach. Lots of umbrella seats and just as many locals offering you a drink and other consumables and items for purchase. Keep your shoes on, you never know what's buried in the sand. Stray dogs poop mostly everywhere.Average view. Close to the shops. Nice Hotels nearby.Peak hour is around 6:30pm onwards and the bars nearby really get going. The bars are probably more of an attraction than the beach."
59_lee,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",Dec 2017,"Possible the worst beach we have ever visited. OMG the state of it, rubbish & litter, the sea is, in some area's dark grey.. Enjoyed couple of bars. Thats the limit."
jonesem92,New Jersey,Feb 2018,Garbage everywhere. Walk South to Kuta Beach for slightly less garbage. Apparently it‚Äôs not like this all year but who knows.
Gwyn J,"London, UK",Feb 2018,"A long and safe bech for swimming with the biggest waves.  Lots of people surfing but plenty of space for everyone.  There are quiet areas of the beach and lively areas with lots of bars and restaurants.  Saturday and Sunday were very busy especially nearing sunset, but the rest of the week was quiet in comparison.  The one and probably only downside was the incredible amount of plastic washed up on the beach. Its just a few meters around what appears to be the high tide mark and goes literally the whole length of the beach.  The water itself seems quite clean and so does the beach higher up than the high tide mark, but the amount of plastic has to be seen to be believed."
nashr0,"Margaret River, Australia",Feb 2018,"After walking for hours to find this unique location, we stumbled up the stair case from the promenade and were greeted by smiling staff happy to assist, we requested this roof top bar locations and were escorted to the lifts, greeted again by helpful smiling staff guided up to the rooftop bar and met by a cheerful hostest egar to find us the best location face the ocean veiws and breeze waiting staff quickly perused with drinks, cocktail list and tapas style snacks. No sooner had we ordered food and beverages arrived, uninterrupted panoramic vista of Bali shores with a great sound track playing in the back ground all made for a very rewarding trekWe were offered another round of drinks to welcome in the sunset which is breathlessly pleasing come duskDont waste any time catch a cab to 66 and enjoy the experience as we were for tunate enou6ght too"
Andy P,50 contributions,Feb 2018,Really disappointed with our visit to this beach. It is pretty much a rubbish/plastic dump and no one seems to care.It‚Äôs is not pleasant to walk on or see. I wouldn‚Äôt be keen to swim there either.
Hans O,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2018,We are used to clean beaches but these ones are filthy. went for a walk early in the morning and the receding tide had left a wall of rubbish on the beach- would definitely not want to swim there
fclaus49,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2018,During rain season there are lots of plastic everywhere until it's cleaned away. Definitely not optimal for kids. This time of the year is definitely a no go for beach lovers
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,These are the pictures that Bali Tourism does not want you to see!But in the end this is how it looks in early February in the rain. Small parts of the beach are cleaned up by the small tourism operators trying to sell Lounge chair space.2200
kathryn soo,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,This side of beach is quite dirty. There is rubbish everywhere although the waves might be good for surfers. There is tractors collecting rubbish but the tractors just collect the rubbish and put it aside. Not a place to chill but can just take a walk at this beach if you are staying at hotels opposite the beach
saraost98,62 contributions,Jan 2018,"Don't bother if you've actually seen a nice beach in your life because this is a grey sanded, rubbish filled, dirty watered dump."
muhfikhrii,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Coming to double six beach, i always come to visit bakso tenda biru. It offers the meatball of local food. You may see many Indonesian come to visit here, it you eat spicy food? Try Bakso tenda biru."
lillypilly72,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,"What can I say awful dirty beach, rubbish everywhere and unkept, not suitable for swimming, tractors everywhere collecting rubbish, not a tourist site to visit, better beaches elsewhere."
Dimas A K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,A good time when u visit this place in the 4.30pm. First time u must try is a Bakso Gerobak Biru and the Onde-onde. While waiting sunset u can enjoy and relax on a chair. Wonderful sunset!
Linda W,2 contributions,Dec 2017,"We holiday  Christmas in nusa dua resort one week which was beautiful  then 2weeks in Seminyak at double six beach so disappointed , very dirty we could not believe it ,we had villa so had our own small pool so fab  for us if not omg would  have been wasted dream of we thought Bali should be ,also the threat of mount agong eruption keeping tourist away lost the spirit of the true Bali experience.Linda & Allan from Scotland x"
Gautham_hr,"Bengaluru, India",Jan 2018,"Nice beach with many small shacks.. u can grab a quick bite, like, meat bowl, noodles etc.. maybe some beer or some juice too.. good to laze around in the evening watching the sun go down.. it‚Äôs clean too...Ps- I‚Äôve seen a few of the locals mocking traveler‚Äôs there.. not too harmful though.. "
Imoy1979,3 contributions,Jan 2018,"Loved to spent afternoon here on double six beach,always ate a nice bakso gerobak biru,enjoyed the beautiful sunset,with a cold beer."
rrrebekah,47 contributions,Aug 2017,"Perfect place to get a tan, lounge about, or watch the sunset on a bean-bag chair. Can be crowded at times but not packed like Kuta is, and definitely without a horde of people trying to hustle you. Would definitely revisit!"
Mamba_11,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2018,This one is a nice beach with lot of people around. Best part is the live singing that happens in front of couple of cafes. Comparatively longer beach with lots of waves which is usual in Bali.
Colin A,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Jan 2018,Surf looked fine but the beach is dirty. Lots of dogs and so much plastic waste.  There has been a half hearted effort to clean but I will not go back. They have started to clean up the streets of Bali so why wouldn‚Äôt they also make a real effort with the beaches?
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Jan 2018,"Much less crawled than Kuta counterpart, which is already huge plus. Lots of umbrellas to rent for small fee, plenty of afternoon live entertainment venues and of course very noce spot to enjoy sunset."
tonithomson5,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"Stunning all along double 6 . Lots of places to eat with good food selections, great offerings of different types of seats. Beautiful sunsets üåÖ"
Kyksta,Singapore,Dec 2017,"My favourite beach in Bali. I have been here around 7 times at various times in the year. Yes, unfortunately there is alot of rubbish on the beach around Xmas time, but this rubbish all comes from Java and the nearby islands. The Balinese do their best to clear it up - but there really is alot. At any other time of the year the beaches are lovely. A great place to sit on a deckchair under an umbrella and relax. Surf lessons and boogie board hire is also on offer. Drinks service available. A great way to spend the way."
330priya,23 contributions,Jan 2018,I had much better expectations from beaches in Bali. There was trash around. I felt as if I was on Juhu beach
Denis Y,79 contributions,Jan 2018,"Yet another great beach in Bali. Friendly people, relaxing atmosphere, paradise on earth. Go, relax and enjoy freedom you have never known"
raicr22,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Had some great waves here and hung out for sunset a few times at some of the warungs on the beach. relaxing!
HPorter90,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Dec 2017,"This isn't a nice beach. As much as there will be trash washed up from the ocean there is no effort from tourists to not contribute to more waste, and nor for anyone to maintain the beach. We had no idea about this beforehand, and walking along the beach on the first day of our holiday was not the way to get in the holiday mood."
Grant F,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2018,This is a great beach for surfers and for beach walking.  It is particularly good for the late afternoon drink at one of the many warungs.  Pity about the garbage washing up on the beach however....
Joakim L,"Malaga, Spain",Jan 2018,The beach is nice (january) awesome to surf in when its as many wawes as today! I hope they clean up the garbage everyday because its coming up on the beach everyday!
Brian J,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,"Double Six beach is almost perfect. The water is warm, the waves are just right, not too small or too big. Ideal beach to swim with no rips - safe for children and great waves to start learning how to surf. Plenty of available chairs and umbrellas for rental at a cheap price. Lots of restaurants available just off the beach. The only negative is the constant badgering of the locals trying to sell you something on the beach who don't take no for an answer easily"
James O,"Connemara, Ireland",Jan 2018,Visited here from Kuta. Take blue bird taxi and go on meter. Quoted 105000 rupiah 23000 on meter big difference. Beach is nice not as crowed as Kuta. Big waves here but safe if you stay between flags. Not as many hawkers thanks be to god. Sunbeds hired out two for 100000 for day haggle. If looking for a beer drink at vendors hiring sunbeds much cheaper than beach bars. La planche almost twice the price. Overall nice experience.
Al_21_121,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Three main beaches situated next to one another Food is good Gr8 atmosphere Staff friendlyIf you are able to view a sunset do it ...an experience wow ... 
Samantha E,40 contributions,Nov 2017,We had the most fun learning to surf on this beach.  The waves are really good for beginners.  And it's a very social beach so it's easy to find cool people to have a drink with after you catch some waves.
doncasterlevi,doncaster,Jan 2018,"The Government pleaded with people to come to Bali and there is nothing they can control about the brewing volcano but they can control and should managing the condition of the beaches The rubbish was disgusting over the new year period so much people staying in hotels along the beach had to go to other areas to find a better beach It is a disgrace that tourist tax is taken and for what ever reason they cannot even clean up the beaches Someone should be responsible for this because many people I spoke too would not come back , not because of the volcano but because of the disgustingly poorly managed beaches "
CuriousTravellerDXB,Dubai,Dec 2017,Two words. Don't visit. Filthy (note: rainy season contributed to the state of the beach but tourist attitude and littering has a lot to do with it). 
Paulo B,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2018,"Like most of the beaches in Bali, trash is abundant at the sand and in the ocean. The current status of the beaches in Bali undermines the all Bali experience. Photos may be misleading and this is not a white sand beach."
Echa Marditicha,200 contributions,Jan 2018,"Not really a nice beach but here you could just go and sit down on bean bags from cafes and restaurants along the beach to enjoy the sunset with live music. Things to do here are surfing, playing kites, swim etc. The prices are a bit crazy expensive for foods and beverages, the taste was not so worth the price for the cafe."
Mimo M,1 contribution,Jan 2018,"Dirty beach, very very dirty sea.You must walk a lot forward before the sea level reaches your shoulder.Thailand is a much better place than Bali"
Arvinder G,"Seoul, South Korea",Jan 2018,"This beach is just visit but not good for family activities ,been there two different times but mostly flooded with local and Australian young crowds ,good for visit but not for fun"
Nana nana,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2017,"Location is near the airport, the sunset scenery is beautiful, i love drinking coconut and eating bakso which sold everywhere around the beach. And it's good to spend time with friends in this beautiful beach."
Anais A,93 contributions,Dec 2017,The sunset in this beach is so pretty as you can see in the picture below that was taken effortlesly
rdk1,"Melbourne, Victoria",Dec 2017,"We were there in December and the beach was filthy. Washed up plastic, muck on the tide line, and unsuitable for swimming."
twiinklex,762 contributions,Oct 2017,"I love this beach mainly because it wasn't too crowded or noisy, nor was there any litter. Maybe I came on the right month. The waves looked awesome and the sunset was perfect. There is also lots of variety when it comes to food and drinks, all at pretty affordable prices.Beautiful beach! Perfect for unwinding with a book and drink. Come early to snag a good spot for the sunset."
CongiaEnterprises,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,Be prepared to have locals approach you and solicit their wares.the sand is not yellow like most believe and the waves do pound hard. Great for a quick surf.
Cragledog,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2017,"Had been here many times before but in July and early December. Unfortunately a great amount of rubbish and large debris (large logs) on beach.  They were clearing it slowly, but there is only so much they can do.  Was told by life guard not safe to swim because of debris. Very disappointing as have walked up and down this beach and has been very clean and children swum and took surfing lessons. Was told rubbish came in from neighbouring islands, not sure about that, more like from Bali due to seasonal rain and winds. Very disappointed, will try Sanur which is cleaner but no surf."
Josie V,3 contributions,Nov 2017,We have had cocktails on the roof over looking the ocean. Followed by beautiful home made pastas. Bellissimo.
ravifour,"Pearland, TX",Nov 2017,"nice place with tons of restaurants, bars and other vendors.I have seen people get foot massage on the beach and drinking coconuts. Lots of scooter rentals, bike rentals and surf lessons and or surf board rentals. good place to spend a day or half a day"
Melissa  H,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2017,Filthy beach filled with plastic. Daughter waded in camd out 2minutes later with a huge plastic bag. We live in Palm Cove so are aware of the plastic dangers for sea creatures. Pro's though quite Area and nowhere near as foul a Kuta. Balinese clean up your filth.
kenley t,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Come at night, but nothing to do. only some bars with live music. the beach well maintain .need some lights more."
pkaran,"Pune District, India",Oct 2017,"Double Six beach is pretty close to Seminyak beach, so visit to both beaches can be clubbed. It is a nice, neat and clean beach with several options and activities to do."
Martin W,15 contributions,Oct 2017,"After you fight your way through the caf√©, bar chairs & beer sellers eskys that clog up every entrance & access point, you arrive at a beach that is just like all beaches in the area, overpopulated. You are much better off going to one of the many other glorious beaches on this island that is away from the tourist hotspots"
shrey20152015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,A happening beach...many good beach shacks...surfing...the main road leading to the beach is lined by shops selling all varieties of stuffs.Clean in August when we went.
Sirimon,"Harrow, UK",Nov 2017,"Great place for seeing beautiful sunsets while sipping a beer.  However, would recommend paying a bit extra and going to one of the rooftop bars for two main reasons 1) the beach was filthy - cans, bottles, plastic bags, rotting food, etc etc was littered all along the beach and presumably it all gets washed into the sea at high tide, and 2) very noisy beach bars as they set up large speakers on the beach that blare out music at full volume."
Sebastian K,"Helsinki, Finland",Nov 2017,"During low tide there are lots of plastic everywhere until it's cleaned away. There is a cleaning crew, but in November there is a lot of debris after high tide.The beach is not for swimmers, more for surfers. It is at it's best at sunset when you can watch the sun go down and chill while listening to live music. Definitely not optimal for kids."
PatBintang,"Lanzarote, Spain",Nov 2017,This time of the year is definitely a no go for beach lovers. Huge amounts of plastic and other trash plus stinking rivers. Horrible!
hubi61,"Manchester, UK",Nov 2017,"A good place for Surfer, when you need beginner lessons.  The beach is the most time clean, but after a rainy day is it dirty on the beach."
61Greg,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,Not a bad beach for surfing yet also a safe beach for little kids as the waves break out a bit.  Sand not white but plenty of beach lazy boys to rent if you want.
60jonno,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,No use complaining about bali beaches. Unless they are in front of an expensive beachside hotel they will be messy - and even then might still be messy. But you go there for the ability to sit on the beach in warm sunny weather and be served cheap cold beer delivered to you while reclining on a chair or bean bag also provided. All in all it is a relaxing and cheap  break. This beach is possibly a bit better than many and with the new wall being built  perhaps filters out some of the mess when viewed from hotels ?
AnthDR,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,We found the sea water so dirty its not that healthy to surf here Bali needs to clean things because tourists don't like it.
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2017,"This beach is north of Kuta beach and can be easily accessed from Legian street, past Legian and close to Seminyak. Or just walk up the beach from Kuta. It will take you about 30 minutes or so. Nice sunsets. Plenty of beach chairs to hire."
Michael W,8 contributions,Oct 2017,"Great spot to learn or to hone your surf skills. Plenty of other things to do here like body surf, swim, catch a suntan, fly a kite, enjoy a bintang, have a massage, buy some goodies, have a decent lunch and watch a wonderful sunset."
Iwan P,7 contributions,Sep 2017,one of beach along kuta beach area exactly front of double six hotel at arjuna street.You can enjoy atmosfer charming place with seat on the sofa on the white sands with a botle cold beer and if need food..many pub n bar behind your sofabest time at sunset time...amazing
DeborahLBrisbane,Brisbane,Oct 2017,"Great place to take in the stunning Bali sunset.  Enjoy good food, beverages and live music whilst relaxing in a bean bag on the sand."
Jerry J,174 contributions,Oct 2017,"Double six beach has restaurants and bars on the beach front itself. There is more going on than compared to beaches in Kuta or Legian, although just as busy. I would definitely recommend checking it out even if you have to make the trip from Kuta. Just make sure you come for sunset.  "
Natal Surbakti,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2017,"Bali pamper us with many choice of good beached and this one is one of the best . The favorite time to come here is during sunset time between 6 to 7 pm . It could be crowded yet vibrant and live . Enjoy the bakso with teh botol, cost you less than 30K and enjoy the sunset view if 1 Million  USD"
brittain2003,19 contributions,Oct 2017,Not the nicest beach in Bali. Lots of litter and lots of touts trying to sell fake goods. Spoils what could be a nice beach
evert0n1,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"By day the beach is nice not crowded and good to learn how to surf, at sunset there‚Äôs four beach bars B9B is my favourite food good and the Bintang cold with bean bags to listen to the duos playing laid back songs..."
Deb F,"Geelong, Australia",Nov 2017,Had dinner with friends further up the beach then walked Wong the 66' beach with all the wonderful restaurants sat on the bean bags in the sand listening to the waves chatting quietly with a nice liquor to finish off the night so peaceful and relaxing   I so love Bali 
Greg C,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2017,"A quiet walk on the beach you dodge the rubbish and look out for broken glass. Lovely sunsets, nice restaurants."
Vee272014,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,Such a beautiful setting for a sunset drink or whatever you please. Plenty of beanbags to lay around on and just watch the world go by
clavis2016,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,"This is a little hideaway a beach for everyone...Once you find this you will return for it's splendour,clean sand, amenities and the usual Balinese welcoming! it is situated in an ideal position and easy to get to as u stroll down to the Double Six Beach with its charming coffee & tourist shops. Fronting the beach is a fine selection of foods for every taste from take away, casual or fine dining... IT's A MUST..........."
tonysprings,hartlepool,Oct 2017,Fantastic sandy beach served by lots of restaurants on the beach....the perfect place to lay and sunbathe the world away
franzico m,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"nice view , good for relax or chit chat while you can drink beer.Good beach for expert surfer.. you should go to this beach when you visit bali."
pnssnp,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2017,"located in walking distance to the hotel mariott, it is a very happening beach with music bands playing on the clean sands."
Sonta S,3 contributions,Oct 2017,Enjoying sunset with colorful parasol along with live music from local band. You need to buy drink + snack so you can sit on the bean sack chair.
Let's Go Sightseeing,"Noida, India",Jun 2017,"This beach has enough & more options for shacks & beach chairs. You can sit here for hours & watch all the activity happening around you. The water isn't too cold; so you can opt for a dip.However, the beach needs to be more clean. We saw of stream of black water coming from inland & getting released into the sea. Not good!"
Stewart A,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2017,breathtaking to watch the  surf rise up  for miles in each direction.   the  sand floor was  flat for  hundreds of meters out  so there was no  undertow  in many spots.   great for  body surfing  or sitting  meditating upon the  ocean waves.  fun to watch the  surfers doing tricks.   
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Oct 2017,"Loved the beach and again the locals are very friendly and kind, went to a couple of the beach huts for the deck chairs and a few beers, lots of wind surfers and lovely Australians, can watch them surf for hours, "
Jen H,"Lismore, Australia",Oct 2017,"I always appreciate the comfortable water temperature, being  able to walk in wasily for a swim. Double Six has the wonderful bean bag bars later in the afternoon- walk arou d until you find music that suits your tastes and check out the differing prices for drinks and food as they vary greatly. The beach here  was clean. Walking further south to Legian showed disgusting rubbish on the waterline and sand. What a pity that the huge beach front resorts do not employ locald to keep the beach clean: the hotels make a huge amount of money from these beaches but obviously take no repsonsibility for their upkeep. Kudos to Kuta and Seminyak for taking time to enssure that their lives beaches are cleaned."
MateEeMa,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2017,"Disgustingly dirty beach like all the beaches nearby. Would not spent time there yet alone swim. Full of trash. Was bad 7 years ago when we first visited, even worse now."
Deviranti G,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"lovely spot to watch sunset, the guy in charge came to me when i sat on the beach bench, and asked for how long i'll be there, the rent was IDR300,000/hours.. and I said ""i'll be there only until 6PM (around 2 hours) so, how much?"" then the guy said, ""i'll give u 150 then"".. i was like ""???"" with a cool face.. but then it's a deal! hahaha.. ^oo^ ,  i enjoy the beach (even if i lost my glasses by a big wave hit)."
Dr_coffee_bh,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2017,I love this beach just you can learn to surf or just enjoy the waves or just watch the amazing sunset.just keep away from the red flags (CAREFUL THE UNDERCURRENT)
Tracey D,12 contributions,Oct 2017,Great little spot. Relax on a beanbag with a cocktail and enjoy the sunset. Live music and fireworks the night we were there.
SarahDurban,"Cape Town, South Africa",Oct 2017,"Got dropped off by a taxi in the main car park. Could only access the beach in little alleys/certain areas due to all the construction and walls. A few tired and dirty restaurants line what access you do have, and you constantly get harassed by guys offering transport of scooters. Wouldn't waste time going here. I was very disappointed."
StPolo,"Liverpool, UK",Oct 2017,Very popular with surfers and body boarders. Not a beach where you can swim but wave jumping is great. All ameninities are available on the beach
Elke M,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2017,"The beach is very flat and also very clean with dark brown sand. Lots of water sports available, as well as hire of day beds, beanbags etc. good atmosphere with a lot of people around. Also a lot of locals trying to sell merchandise."
Joanne L,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"The first thing my husband and I wanted to experience was a beach walk along Double Six Beach.At first, it seemed pleasant enough until you came across the flow of brown water eminating from a number of areas into the sea.The smell was nauseating and made us want to rush back to the hotel. So disappointing, considering Bali depends on it's Tourism market. The Bali authorities need to fix this as a matter of urgency. It could be wonderful but it clearly isn't!"
Lydia A,9 contributions,Sep 2017,We started our travels in Seminyak before going onto other areas of Bali and other islands in Indonesia. The was my least favourite beach as it was more like dirt than sand and actually smelt like bad dog breath. Much nicer beaches in Indonesia! Would recommend the Gili Islands if you like perfect beaches.
Phill S,Australia,Oct 2017,Great bars and excellent place to watch sunset . Hire a beach chair and umbrella and enjoy a beer or cocktail. 
T S,"Jupiter, FL",Oct 2017,Very cool atmosphere at night. Several beach bars playing live music on the sand. Lots of people walking around. Several surf schools open during the day. Beach is cleaned each morning. Can walk for ever. Great people watching.
chris282,44 contributions,Jul 2017,Lots of beach vendors who would come around to offer their goods for sale. Beach is alway crowded with people who wants to get a fast bucks from you. Lots of beach sun deck for suntanning session
Nurzariah__Z,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,One of my fav beaches! We were there two times during our 8 days trip. Chill out to catch sunset with a bottle of tea sosro and a bowl of bakso. Yummy! We were staying in Legian during our last days in Bali but we don‚Äôt mind travelling all the way here as we prefers this beach than Kuta! 
Tania W,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,"Went there for an afternoon lunch and drink, great place near the pool, recommend the tempura prawns. Service was great. Lovely bathrooms"
Armaminta,"Cobram, Australia",Sep 2017,"We actually visited sept 2016 but can't go back that far. The beach was kept really clean, there were lifeguards which, unfortunately, my teens had to be aided by.l as they were nearly swept out in a strong rip. Beach hawkers were plentiful and a bit pushy but it was all stuff we were interested in. Daughters got their braids done for $15 for long hair which was way cheaper than anywhere else and, in my opinion, more memorable for them. We had pedicures and bought souvenirs. Rented a tent but was charged the full day price even though he cleared up an hour after we arrived at 3.30pm. He just laughed at me and said, per hour price so be clear! We didn't get upset, it's one of those things! One night we had dinner st the beach and it was a magical experience. We sat on bean bags around the table as the sun set and the musicians set up. We danced, laughed, talked and ate. Seven of us and it cost around $70 AUD. we didn't let the kids swim at night of course. Renting surfboards was easy, arranging surf lessons was easy. Everyone is geared up for Aussie families. Plenty of pubs around the place. Good cheap breakfasts. "
beccax22,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"Nice stretch of beach. Sand is definitely one of the softest I have ever walked on (no shells or rocks to be seen). Definitely more of a place for surfing than going in for a swim. There are signs that say you can't go in for a swim, but of course we went in for a dip when it was too hot. Having said that, I nearly got hit by a surf board when a big wave came crashing and the girl with the surfboard lost control. So be vigilant!Sunbeds are expensive. For 2 sunbeds and a parasol it was 200,000 idr and we tried to haggle with the man to no avail. The next day we went elsewhere and we were able to get 2 bed ands a parasol for 150,000 after haggling (though the beds weren't as comfy).There is also wifi on the beach if you stay by the central area- great!"
Matthew B,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,A little south on Double Six are the umbrella bars on the sand. They are a great place to watch the sunset and are a lot more basic and chilled then the bigger beach bars.
jc26_11,"Langkawi, Malaysia",Sep 2017,An amazing very long stretch of beach. Beautiful sunsets lots of beach restaurants. Sand clean but water very murky and we saw and smelt sewage flowing into the sea from stream run offs.
JJOH,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2017,This is an extension to the south of Seminyak beach and suffers in my opinion from over development. Too many sun beds etc on the beach and too many water sports vendors. I realise that these things are there for tourism but perhaps the balance has been lost or perhaps it is simply not what I am looking for. However there are many better beaches elsewhere
jeanette g,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,we stoped in for a drink. Cost us $34 for 2 coctails. we wont bother with thos place again. Also drinks are very small. No great vibe either
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,"Double Six beach is the perfect place for beginners to learn surfing. The waves are not too big, there are a few instructors on the beach and it's not too crowded (like Kuta) "
Carmel H,5 contributions,Sep 2017,"Lots of fun, great teachers who will have you up in no time.Facilities to lock your belongings away, towel is provided, photos at the end of the class to review. Just do it!"
Glenn Nicholls,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,"Alot of construction and remodeling along the road front but what you get once you reach the beach is worth it, friendly locals all competing to make your stay memorable. during our stay in Bali we visited the beach on several afternoons for the sunset we chose different bars and and sections of the beach, We definitely recommend you spend at least one afternoon relaxing and enjoying sunset on Double Six Beach"
Amr E,"Cairo, Egypt",Sep 2017,"Nice beach front.. has an open air club with great selection of music (wont miss its location as it visible and loud)You have lots of restaurants selection, however many of them were under renovation and part of the beach was locked. Most annoying thing is the massive amount of scooters running in the narrow beach walk lane. Riders are very comfortable riding in that narrow area in a two way direction which you have to dance to avoid getting hit by one."
djmcenergy,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2017,"stayed at the double six, and they have a beach club area over the road for guests. nice area that has full service and charge back o room."
owloAustralia,Australia,Sep 2017,"Quite sad to look at, the road along the beach is filthy and covered in construction works and barricades. Beach itsself is not that good, far better ones anywhere in Australia and many other places in the world.   Yes, you can sit in a bean bag and drink and watch the sunset, with a passing parade of predominately heavily inked Australians promenading up and down in their Bintang singlets with a bottle in their hand.  Jalan Arjuna (Double 6 road) itself has some nice little shops and a couple of good places to eat, but far better beaches elsewhere."
Sandra N,"Whangarei, Northland, New Zealand",Sep 2017,Our hotel was a short stroll away from Double Six Beach. We spent many hours relaxing in the bean chairs sipping on a Bintang watching the sunset. Each bar has live music each night and they all fill up prior to the sun setting. The beach itself is a nice beach and great for swimming. Enjoyed our time there.
jastuewe,"Milwaukee, WI",Sep 2017,"the beach was nice and well worth the walk / visit.  we laid out and had some coconut water and mixed drinks.  The beach is very dirty and there are no garbage cans around, so you need to be careful where you step, but still very nice and worth the visit!"
ross m,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2017,Gotta love this spot. Its pretty amazing what they pull together in 30mins. . . and  dont miss the sunset whatever you do. 
Mavis L,40 contributions,Sep 2017,"Beach is clean , no rubbish scattered everywhere near the ocean except the construction on going , also some locals trying to sell handcrafts etc . Good for surfing and sunbathing for sure , other than that nothing much to expect .  "
Eloise T,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,Having drinks while watching the sunset was a highlight. It was a lovely setup with live music. Would easily go back again!
Jason H,4 contributions,Sep 2017,Great evening we had a beautiful sunset and a drink and snacks in a bean bag on the beach for $20 Australian
Jahmin Lerum,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,"Nice sand, decent waves, close restaurants and all the easy amenities to make a day at the beach care free and relaxing."
Guyglenda,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,"Beautiful restaurant for watching the sunset.  We had tapas and cocktails very enjoyable, prices are over priced which is a shame, as they have music dancing later on in the evening, which is nice, but as i mentioned too expensive!!!! Waitresses are very helpful but they really do push hard for u to keep ordering."
Auz55,68 contributions,Aug 2017,"A beach, just opposite cocoons, a well known venue for the young and the beautiful unfortunately the beach itself has a long dirty drain, running from thr drarnpipe on thr road, and tricklesright down to the beach . Once you have bipassed this area , the beach is beautiful. Come last in the afternoon, Pick out a bean bag chair, and while away the afternoon, whatching the locals play, soccer on the beach, while you settle in with a cocktail. Bliss. "
SanghasUK,"Alton, UK",Aug 2017,This is a nice beach with soft sand but it get's really crowded. My family found that if you travel another 800 metres north it gets less busy and the beach gets wider. You have a more relaxed time.
IndiaTravels97,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2017,"This beach is great for everything - learning how to surf, sunbathing during the day, but we really liked coming to one of the many beach bars to chill out with a drink and watch the skies, or our nightly beach walks. The beach is so long, you can walk as far as you can, away from the noise for some quiet, before heading back to the live music. Really great."
swnj_1701,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2017,Great atmosphere on this beach. Sunsets are beautiful. The swimming can be dangerous because of high waves but fun to play in the shallow areas 
Josh B,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"This beach is very famous, my wife want to go very much. We came during school holiday season. Even though beach was very beautiful, it was too many people, cannot full relax."
xiurongzhang5,"Hangzhou, China",Jul 2017,We love that beach which is so beautiful. The beach is so wider and the weather is so nice. that monment before the sunset I will remember it for ever.
Azean M,9 contributions,Aug 2017,"The best place for beginner surfers, and those who enjoy a good sunset. It's a long stretch so it isn't overly crowded. "
Trish M,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Great place to enjoy sunset, get there about 4.30 and pick your bar/bean bag, soak up the live music, people watch and generally enjoy !"
Allen Tang,86 contributions,Sep 2017,There are a lot of surfers here otherwise the beach is not overly busy. It is a great spot for beginner surfers.
Katia K,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2017,"This beach is perfect if you are a surfer - big waves, lots of surf classes for beginners. However the waves and current are too strong for swimming , so not really suitable for a relaxing day on a beach as you won't be able to get into water (at least during the days when we were there) . Another good time for visiting is sunset time. Amazing! Lots of bars to enjoy the sunset while having a drink/dinner. "
Bianca A,Romania,Aug 2017,"We visited it during low tide so the ocean was very calm and we could have a nice swim. The place is really nice for sunset, even though the restaurants on the beach play music after 5.30 so if you want a quiet sunset you should choose another place. You can find sun beds in this area, but you should definitely bargain with the keepers as they charge you a lot if they see you are foreigner."
Delpiero86,"Radcliffe, UK",Aug 2017,We walked down here as we were staying about 6 or 7 km up the beach. The waves were perfect for surfing. My husband surfed for about 2 and a half hours and I watched and bought some bracelets. The lady sat next to me and handmade the bracelets for me.There was a man selling a crossbow but we didn't buy it as I wasn't sure what airport security would think. Ha ha. And I'm not sure we'd have much use for it.Great surfing. Nice beach. 
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,"The beach has high waves, which make it good exclusively for surfers, it is forbidden to swim as the waves are quit high.There are some very nice coffee shops and restaurants if you just want to chill out!"
Woosie58,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,I've been in Legian for the last 8 days and have been to the beach everyday. It's a great part of the beach and usually not as many rips as other areas. It's very relaxing to be on a lounge and have the option to be served anything you may desire. It's always good to watch the great surfers and also all the surf schools teaching new ones. It's very easy to join a surf school or simply hire a board and get lessons direct from the hirer. Great part of the beach to be on all day and also stay or come back for a few drinks and sunset.
BUGI_70,"Florence, Italy",Apr 2017,"Capil Beach is a long beach in Seminyak, beside Double Six Beach. Very wide with the low tide. Mostly with sunbeds,  it's quite a touristic spot.  It'd be beautiful if it was cleaner. Surf schools, bars and restaurants.Parking can be a nightmare if you drive a car.  No problem with a motorbike. "
Tam T,2 contributions,Aug 2017,This beach is very crowded even on weekdays. It has a very wide and long sloping beach so it's good to bring your dogs or kids to play. Many food stalls but mostly sell local food but you can find a good pop up cafe on the west side of the beach to chill out with cocktails or softdrinks.
Jessica A,"Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia",Aug 2017,you need to rent a bed always need to ask for low price they told me first 120 and then i get it on 80 rupiah
Timothy L,"Market Weighton, UK",Aug 2017,"My partner and I visited the beach as I had read that it was ideal for surfing. Having never surfed before I thought I should have a go. I haggled with the guys to secure a good deal for the sunbeds and surfboard.... so I paid 100,000 IDR for two beds and a surfboard. After having a go with the surfboard and finding it tricky the guy gladly swap it for a body board (not before chuckling to himself) "
nilimag2015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"Many beach shacks in the area,all alive & with live bands in the evenings. Our hotel had a beach club here too. Many shacks renting/selling surfing boards & related stuff. Many hawkers selling stuff too.The road leading to d beach had sooo many shops selling Ato Z , restaurants, massage centres,parlours..."
Claire N,Australia,Aug 2017,We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Double Six. We paid close to $3500 AUD for our stray and found our time there enjoyable. Our room was the ocean facing and the views were excellent. The Plantation restaurant was incredible and the balcony booths we reserved for the night ensured excellent views while we dined. Highly recommend. 
elliottn,"Cincinnati, OH",Aug 2017,"This beach not that great for swimming or just chilling in the water, but there are surfing lessons and other tourist trappings available. The best feature is the sunset views. Sunsets here can be amazing. It worth renting a bean bag chair and having a few cocktails at sunset. Definitely sunset is best, otherwise nothing great. "
Anthony D,4 contributions,Jan 2017,"There is a fun buzz around this beach. Although its not the whitest sand or the most tranquil, its good to come in the late afternoon with friends."
wayan-btd,"Gianyar, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Viewing sunset or enjoying breeze night wind, this place has them. But the waitress were a kind of bit off, we were receiving our orders 30 minutes later while they so responsive at picking up bule's.A good place to have a overnight chit-chat but should have improved their service consistently without discrimination."
Jo H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2017,"Nice beach lots of people trying to sell things though, just pretend you are asleep and they still wont leave you alone. Like along all the beaches you can hire chairs and surfboards, and have a great day."
Christine P,4 contributions,Aug 2017,Love this beach. It's very clean. Locals selling their ware but don't bother you. Lovely place to watch the sunset 
ThaiTraveller2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"Great beach to  catch up with friends walk along or have a drink or two, a feed or just watch the sunset as many people do"
Emma T,"Bracknell, UK",Aug 2017,"Spent most of a day here just relaxing after a full day of travel. Hired a pair of beds 400,000 (maybe should have negotiated but jet lag was in full swing). Lots of surf schools using the water so no swimming allowed and when I dipped myself in the current was very strong so be careful. As we left around 5, everywhere was setting up for the evening with stages being set up at each bar for live music so I'm sure the evenings will be fun. Not a place to go if after some piece and quiet as was very busy."
Jackielucy,"Mooloolaba, Australia",May 2017,"Yes you guessed it this place is one of the most expensive places to eat or drink in Bali..Dont know why....it is an awfull concrete building no atmoshere at all, the ocean view is great but thats it,be aware also parts of the resort insist on a dress code in some areas........The local bars/restaurants either side of this cold unwelcoming building have the same great views only with a much cheaper price tag on the food & drink that is served & seriously a much brighter & happier constitutioin, it would seem they actually train the staff in this place to be alouf & stuck up "" not sure why you would go to Bali to experience that sort of nonsence?Do you & your wallet a favour & pass on this place for a night out........."
Morten_Nielsen,"Vejle, Denmark",Sep 2016,"For swimming maybee not the best spot, but for surfing or even learning how to surf, a great placeSunbeds however are way to pricy "
christine l,"Napier, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"What a fabulous setting to eat dinner while watching the sun set.Only issue we had was all the people trying to sell us stuff, this went on all night and while I appreciate people in Bali work dam hard to make a living, harder than kiwis could imagine it is not overly pleasant when eating dinner."
Jobine R,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2017,Good beach but everyday Red Flag for no swimming allowed! Still adults can and are going in!Very strong current and not suitable for young children.Nice relaxing rental beach beds - make a deal for day price ! Lots of beach selling ladies - very expensive so know what you're willing to pay :-)
LindaRuse,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2017,"Great friendly atmosphere where the bars put out bean bag chairs which are so comfortable.  Lovely food, great music and atmosphere."
Jenna R,"New South Wales, Australia",Jul 2017,"My husband and i loved Double Six beach. Beers, good vibes and some sun on a beanbag is the perfect way to spend the afternoon in Bali and watch the sunset.No need to go to pretentious beach clubs (Potato Head) and pay ridiculous prices for a beer or cocktail."
Karthik Shankar,87 contributions,Nov 2016,"Catch some waves, drink some beer, stroll along the beach, watch the sunset, enjoy a game of soccer or lounge in one of the many beachside restaurants and enjoy a night of karaoke. The beach captures everything that is great about Bali, its welcoming, relaxed and just about always having a good time!"
Thomas M,"Sissach, Switzerland",Jul 2017,"Had been at Double six Beach today with the family (2kids 7&10h, and the beach has been perfectly clean. What you need to know is, that from Dec-Mar), the beach is NOT be cleaned, as there is too much garbage coming out of the sea because of the winds. So, you cannot go during that time. This is not because of the Bali garbage, but because of the tide, most coming from Indonesia mainland. From Apr-Nov, the beach is being cleaned daily- sposnored by several large organisations. Only 4 stars, as the beach is pretty crowded wth a lot of low quality beach bars."
Rachel A,Australia,Jul 2017,Great bars/restaurants and amazing spot to kick back and watch the sunsets from the beach. Most bars have seating on the beach and quite often a band playing. Pricing is very affordable.
Steven Lim,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2017,"Visited this stretch of the beach right in front of the Double Six Hotel because our villa happen to have their own beach corner there. Was pleasantly surprised that the beach is wide and clean and not too crowded. We were glad that our villa had their own quality sunbed and shades far superior than those beach vendors' chargeable ones. The waves at places are huge and strong, ideal for the budding surfers but the spot in front of ours was fine for adults. Water is clean though visibility poor. The occasional trinkets vendors can be irritating but they get the message after a few polite rejections. Had a great time here lazing away and dipping in the water. The best part is we had a private outdoor shower to wash up before hitting the shops and eateries of the Double Six area. "
Maritroel,"Horsens, Denmark",Jul 2017,In Semyniak and at the beach you are never bored. There are lots of things to do and see for everybody. 
Andrew H,3 contributions,Jul 2017,This beach is nice.  The regular beach sellers like to target foreigners but are not intimidating.  The black sand stains your clothes and your feet so you might want to wash off when you leave.  The beach has an array of bars and several live bands playing....it almost seems like battle of the bands but sitting in the right place will drown out the sound of nearby bands.
Nickbails9299,"Strathalbyn, Australia",Jun 2017,A clean beach with loads of beds to choose from. Enjoyed watching sunsets and walking.Beware of people just wanting to sell you something - this beach is no exception.Dont forget to by your lantern to let off at night time
Spesh7,"Cork, Ireland",Jul 2017,"We found Paradise ! Absolutely loved every minute of the stay. It was 5 days of bliss ! We got upgraded as it was our honeymoon and we just kived the room ! The balcony was long enough to have and train a football team ha. We also had complimentary drinks and honeymoon welcome upon arrival. It couldn't be anymore professional than it was set up. The bathroom with a tv attached right in front of the bath tub. The shower in both forms shower head and over head tropical fall. The staff so pleasant and ok its part of the job but it just felt more organic than forced. We were late to the pool a few mornings and worried about no sun lounges but the pool and lagoon staff always found room for us. This was a big plus for my new wife as she loves the sun. It would be a disservice to name individuals because every one made the stay so pleasant for us. We dine on the rooftop on day one and the view is something to behold, the view especially at sunset is magical. Plus the food was really good and reasonable compared to irish prices anyway. On our last night we visited the plantation grill bar in the hotel, we stepped in the elevator and stepped out in 1922 New York. It was like the old time Jazz Bars from New York movies. The ambiance, the food, the music, the conpany and the drinks were all top class 5 star rating. A little pricey but well worth the quality. I must mention ""Koma"" our waiter , smiling from ear to ear and when he heard it was our honeymoon well he brought out a plate with happy honeymoon and some specialist chocolates, classy touch. A great guy with great manners and welcoming approach. When we were checking out it all became very real that our stay was our with Double six Bali. Id struggle to say ive been anywhere with better service. We are sad to be leaving here and will hopefully make a return in some years to come as it was just a holistic, spiritual and all round bloody amazing honeymoon !Thank you Audrey and James Claffey "
adisuranto,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,A fun place to relax while swimming in the ocean and while enjoying the sunset a delicious meal free of noise
fbsloot,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,Scammers around the public toilet block it off and demand a 5000 rupiah payment if you need to use it. What a crap place. People will just end up urinating in the water. First place I've ever visited that needed a payment to relieve yourself. 
Jonathan P,31 contributions,Jul 2017,This beach is always busy. Considering the surge of growth over the past 20yrs. It was the dead end of bali. Now you cant park and is very full. The inlet river to the right is not the best and is sometimes very dirty depending on the day.
Eka Widya Ristanti,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Double six the best beach.. the best view, the best in Bali.. come on visit Bali and Denpasar - Indonesia"
garybush,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2017,"The beach at Double Six (Legian) is the best of the beaches running south from Kuta to Seminyak. There is a much larger beach area from the water to the hotels/restaurants etc. The Seminyak beach is steeper and not as much beach area, whilst the beach at Kuta is just too busy.South of Double Six road is Legian, lots of beach bars and restaurants, north of Double Six and there are a number of low end restaurants selling Indo food, burgers etc,"
Nicki H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"Go visit Made Kolu's Beach Bar. Made is so helpful & provides great beach beds, surf lessons, cocktails, cold drinks & a great fun vibe - he's our go to guy at the beach. Whilst they all provide a similar experience at Double Six - I think Made goes the extra mile."
Shereenq,"Danube-Auen National Park, Austria",Jul 2017,"The beach is great , lots of space and many seats to choose from if u come early . Around 50 for a seat. We spent the whole day, the kids had a blast as one of them rented a boogie board for 50 full day and our son went for the surf class -1 1/2 hours for 250 with one of small shacks renting out gear- he got to keep the surf board to practice all day. We asked for rip curl however you had to book a day in advance and pay 1000000 for the lesson . The guyWas great and spent most of the day giving him tips. The only downside was all the sellers insisting we buy their things. Spectacular sunset."
Terry H,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"We walked along this beach a couple of times and couldn't help notice that the surfers were coming right in among the swimmers.Having said that, it is and has long been known as a surfing area.I won't swim where there are surfboards.Having said that, it is a lovely beach to walk on. The sand feels good and if you walk where the water washes up, the temperature of the water is perfect.There are also no shortage of hotel restaurants at which you can stop at if you've got your wallet on you."
Isabella R,192 contributions,Mar 2017,"You need to pay a small fee to rent an umbrella or a reclining chair and relax though. Nothing is free in Bali üòÇThe beach, however, is much cleaner and quieter than Kuta, which led to the 5 star! My local friend recommended this beach too, and he was right. It's not far from the city center, and quite well-maintained! :)"
james c,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beers served to your beach chair, ladies attending to you for pedicure and manicure. Simple folks who leave you alone when you say no to any hawker goods politely. "
robj69,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2017,Large beach mostly clean. Beware of steam run off avoid it go a little south water cleaner. Good waves for surfing & body surfing
PhixyBoy,3 contributions,Jul 2017,"This place good for family if they want to learn surfing.Many surfing school here and they was professional. We happy the surfing instructor good in English, so we can have fast learning.And this place good for waiting sunset"
Ali K,25 contributions,Jul 2017,"Surfing was especially good here, and there are many restaurants located on the road parallel to the beach.  Ideal for starting a long beach walk all the way down to Kuta.  Closer to sunset, all the beachside cafes take out their bean bag chairs and set them on the sand.  Great vibe and atmosphere especially for sunset and continuing on throughout the night with live music!!!! must see!"
Monica F,"Bergen, Norway",Jul 2017,Rented surf boards in Europe earlier - but ended up paddling the water. Great surf schools and perfect waves made it possible for all ten of us to surf the waves in just two hours. Amazing! 
Venkitasubramanian,"Kalpetta, India",Jul 2017,"The beach is live all the time, nice place to take a sun bath , spend the complete day with couple of beer, lot of restaurants nearby "
Linda M,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jun 2017,Great night on the beach watching the sunset while drinking cocktails and getting a foot rub. Loved the atmosphere the people and the band while sitting in the comfy beanbags.
jalsakaro,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2017,Double Six Beach is one of best beaches in Bali. It has fine sands throughout and no stones to hurt your feet. It is great for surfing and swimming. The local lads who teach surfing were great and could speak good English. The beach also has lots of eating places and the food both veg and non veg was good. Prices for the drinks were also reasonable and if you ordered if while lying on your sunbed via the boys who were serving it was tax free and no service charge payable.Cold Fresh Coconut were excellent and so was the local Bintang beer. After seeing other beaches in Bali I am of the opinion that Double Six Beach was the best one around.
JosephLairdFriel,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"This is a nice wide open beach with minimal sunbeds, so no to overcrowdrd. There are a lot of sellers on the beach and you be repeatedly hassled by them to buy some of their rubbish or even worse allow them to massage your legs and feet. They can and do get annoyed if you don't support them by buying something.The sunbeds were $10 for 2 beds but this was dependant on how long you wanted it, what time of day and who the boy was selling the idea to you. Once you have secured a price expect nothing else from the boy, even if your being hassled by the sellers  they won't get involved.Overall I think the beach is OK but many many people just  bring a Towel and sit on the beach.... mostly the younger people. The sea looked safe enough for the kids but I would advise supervision as the waves can get big and powerful. As i said my day at the beach was nothing special. I've certainly been to better beaches with better,nicer facilities and amenities."
tsm85990,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,"Was here is June 2017 and was a great place to pass the time watching the waves, people and drinking a nice beer or three."
Akbar R,"Tehran, Iran",Jun 2017,Its very crowded and not very clean beach but its middle beach for resting.its nice at nights and the prices are good
jss359,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,We walked from Double Six to Potato Head. A lovely walk in the ever-present breeze. But it's sad to see such a beautiful location scattered with plastic debris. The debris created mainly by the very reason the beach ( and other areas ) needs to be clean - tourism and all the people and industries that sustain it.There's a simple solution to some of the pollution - the government should ban the single use plastic bags and have a monetary incentive for recycling soft plastics. 
thejabours,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,Good for a surf during the day and by night beach shacks playing live accoustic cover songs where you can chill with a cocktail on a bean bag. 
gosia L,3 contributions,Jun 2017,Nice spa and bar I really enjoying my time. and the service was excellent and the drinks were lovely. The pool is great and the staff were very nice! 
tango122008,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"We came here on a whim, as it was still early to go elsewhere. Enjoyed the walk along the beach, the eye candy, and dogs frolicking in the sand and sea. Watch the surfers or learn to surf as there are plenty of shops offering lessons, and to 'hang out with Bali boys'. There are deck chairs or bean bags available for rent, so nice comfortable sunbathing places, or you could bring your own towel too."
alexia5r,10 contributions,Jun 2017,This place does not get enough credit!! So glad we found this place. Awesome to watch the sun go down with live music and awesome drinks and food. Sitting on bean bags on white sand with candles is picture perfect. 100% worth the trip! 
Diswank,"Queensland, Australia",Jun 2017,I first travelled to bali in the 70s. It's just such a shame the locals don't take care of the rubbish situation. The government needs to step up and help with this problem. It's a sad state of affairs. One of Bali's biggest attractions- the beach! Has become overloved. It is not a tourist problem it needs to be addressed at local levels. Indonesia needs to step up and take responsibility for their own environmental problems. Tourists come from countries where we are educated to sustain a clean environment. The education system needs to address this asap.  
Salina A,38 contributions,Jun 2017,"Great pool, bar and spa but pricey. I enjoyed my day there. The service was great and the drinks were lovely. The pool is great and the staff were attentive. I enjoyed the spa but it's on the pricey end! Much higher than other hotels in the area. It was lovely though but I'm not sure it warranted the price overall. "
Sarah B,"Queensland, Australia",May 2017,"We loved this beach for the sunset view, didn't surf or swim as we had young kids-but loved having a drink on the bean bag chairs and enjoyed the beautiful sunset!  A must!"
Chris C,"Noosa, Australia",May 2017,"Standard long Kuta style beach. One of the better surf spots because of a stream, but that was polluted - not so nice. Locals (friendly ones) dominate in the surf so hard for intermediate surfers to get waves. Surf schools, etc."
Jessie M,"Calgary, Canada",Jun 2017,The beach is beautiful and there's plenty of comfortable loungers available. There are lots of people trying to sell everything you can imagine and it can be a little overwhelming. Everything that is being sold on the beach is at an inflated price. Just a warning. Two beach chairs can be rented for $5 CAD per day but you have to negotiate. There is a rip tide and no swimming signs posted all along the beach but there were hundreds of people in the water. It's OK. for surfing and chilling in the water near the shore but I wouldn't go for a swim there.Surf lessons and board rentals can be bought for $30-35 for a two hour rental and board for the day. 
Putuwais,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2017,"It is a busy beach, especially in the afternoon. You could spend a good time here with you best friend with having pizza or drink. The are many food shop here."
IanTwee,"Durban, South Africa",May 2017,"After the disappointment of Seminyak Beach, Double 6 is a different scene altogether.  There are good restaurants along the beach, sun umbrellas and surf ""schools"" galore.  A good spot to be active or just watch the world go by."
Richard W,"Greater London, UK",May 2017,"Double Six Beach is a very beautiful, relaxed beach within easy walking distance of most Seminyak hotels and villas.  I am lucky enough to live in Seminyak and regularly walk along the beach. There are a variety of bars, restaurants on the beach front with beach umbrellas and beach cushions.There are many sunbed opportunities at reasonable daily rates. Live music, surfing classes, surf and sunshine. What more could you wish for. Highly recommend."
Peteski2016,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Apr 2017,Lots to do on this centrally located beach with great bars - we went to Double 6 Rooftop and then The Sands - lots of surfing and a beautiful beach - nice beach to walk and lots of bars etc. if you want to take a break
skpatel,"Vadodara District, India",May 2017,Worth visiting... Take beach view room... Very good break fast. Veg preferences available. Very very cooperative staff.. Thanks to Mr. Vincent pillai n special thanks to Sari for serving with beautiful smile 
Luis C,"New York City, NY",May 2017,it's more of a surfers beach....waves are impressive!!spacious quiet beach (unlike Katu beach) with many kiosks serving local and western food and drinks...if you're a sun worshipper and looking for quiet and relaxation then this is the beach for you!
Army1962,"London, UK",Feb 2017,"we did love just to walk on that beach . Lots of little places , very relaxed vibe. We will def be back "
Vicki T,3 contributions,Apr 2017,Sand is black and hard.the surf is quite rough but the bars at the beach are alot of fun and cheap.stick to the hotel swimming pools or head off to coccon beach club 
Mel4178,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2017,We stayed at the Double Six Luxury Hotel.  We chose not to swim in the water at the beach as it was very dirty - we swam in the Hotel pool.  There are some great beach bars in this area and they are a lot of fun and many have entertainment.   Great place to watch the sunset.
Janine010,"Rangiora, New Zealand",May 2017,"If there wasn't so many hawkers, this would be perfect. Nice to come down in the evening and have some drinks on a bean bag and watch the sunset."
Viktor P,7 contributions,Mar 2017,"Nice beach for surfing, relaxing and long walking over a day and night. Lot of beach bars with cheap prices and nice exotics restourants on the evening."
June H,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2017,What a great atmosphere sitting with your feet in the sand having a cold drink watching the sun do down after another beautiful day in Bali.  
Kirst F,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,Great wide open beach but rough seas. Great for surfers. Too many locals hassle you to buy stuff and sun beds are not free 
Nomadman411978,"London, UK",May 2017,"Double Six Beach is more crowded than the neighboring beaches probably because it has more bars, sun-beds etc. so if that's what you're looking for then this is the place for you. With that come the traders and the sea is not that good."
Riki S,1 contribution,May 2017,"this beach is  located in legian area. In here we can find many restaurant and bar.It is nice to come here on sunset time, drink a beer and enjoy the reggae music by the beach boys..."
Peter T,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2017,"A nice clean beach with sun lounges provided by the drink vendors. I settled in under an umbrella with a nice guy keeping my drinks coming as required. I asked him to keep away the pushy locals trying to give you massages, magic mushrooms etc. and he was really good at maintaining my privacy. The sunset was a bonus."
Gyorgy Sipos,"Exeter, UK",May 2017,Beach is ok just if you are white/tourist they actually hunting for you just to rip you off not the nicest experience
Steve T,5 contributions,May 2017,Double six has some good waves at moment where the stream flows out. Unfortunately recent rain has turned the water brown and stanky. Try not to drink lol. Best mid to high tide. 
Fred W,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"It is really disappointing to see what unregulated development has done to what is potentially a spectacular beach. There is clearly an infrastructure problem which sees streams dumping all sorts of rubbish directly into the sea. This impacts water quality as well as dumps all sorts of plastic rubbish on the beach. This is the dark side of tourism laid bare, and one which all tourists must take some responsibility for. Having said that there are still great opportunities to enjoy the amenity of the beach, watch a great sunset and contribute positively to the environment."
t0ngdee,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,Many people were surfing and the crowd was good. A lot of beach benches around as well. Good to take a stroll from here
Sharon L,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Fabulous clean beach, gorgeous sunsets Great beach ""bars"" for pre dinner drinks watching the amazing sunsets"
jimypeny2,australia,Apr 2017,As a result of the previous day's rain (we were told) the water turned a hideous brown every so often which prevented us from swimming.  We had one days swimming in the 8 nights we were there.  Fortunately double six had a pool.The view of the sea is always soothing though.  The people selling trinkets were kind enough to leave us alone. I would recommend going to the other side of Bali if you were after clean and clear sea water
Prince Isher,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,"Fairly clean beach with lot of restaurants, spas and shopping stores near by. Excellent for morning walk."
Islam K,"Cairo, Egypt",Apr 2017,The sea view was nice with nice weather but it wasn't clean in many places and there was dogs I liked the idea of sitting a while in front the sea but didn't like the idea of swimming there 
Tracey P,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Apr 2017,We stayed at luxury double 6.  The beach directly in front is dirty.  The water is brown and we were told that this was from the rains.  We were here 5 days and it never rained and the water never changed.  The beach is filthy and something should be done to clean it up.  Plastic is washed up everyday.  Coming from NZ where we have such beautiful beaches this is a disappointment and a serious problem.  If a beach is what you want then find somewhere else.  We came to experience everything and had a beautiful pool at our hotel so enjoyed it anyway.  Sunset on the beach is my favorite time üå§
Bryan D,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,"Beah was dirty, with toxic materials (similar to orange paint) causing beach closure. Further down (+ a km) beach was open, but couch hire (offered at exhorbitant rates - negotiate down from A$20 ph) only option - and couches were as clean as the beach. Walk down, swim between the (infrequent) flags, and head back to the hotel pool."
Vanessa P,"Surbiton, UK",Apr 2017,Nice beach but you can't really swim in the sea. Nicer than semiyak beach for sure. We paid 2000000 rupas for two beds and umbrella. It was ok for a while but too hot for a long time and a bit expensive. Look like it really comes alive for sunset and kuta was definitely cheaper than semiyak. 
SamD3030,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,The waves are great but the sand and the first 40 metres or so of the water are not so nice. You can only guess why the water is so brown and there is so much rubbish embedded in the sand. Hopefully the island will improve this over time. 
Peter L,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2017,"There are better beaches in Bali than Seminyak, even in Kuta at the rear of the Centro Shopping centre looks better."
KDPop,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,The issues with this beach is the amount of bars and businesses operating on it. There is filth and grime everywhere. The ocean itself has various plastic objects floating around the shore at all times. I know this is a local money maker but the impact on local conservation is alarming. A clean beach brings other forms of income too. 
Michelle,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,Fairly clean beach a popular spot so quite busy hard to get a photo without other people in the background we went at sunset so perhaps not so busy during the day
Michael_Teoh,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,One of the stunning and beautiful beach at Seminyak area. Need go inside ally and cross over some building just can reached the beach. 
KATY P,"Kincumber, Australia",Feb 2017,This beach is nice and clean.  Sometimes a bit rough but overall an enjoyable day out spent here.  Some amazing hotels and restaurants here.  If you need to find it our driver Putu at fair dinkum transport (on tripadvisor) was a great driver and can show you exactly where To go.  
rosemoo12,"Sweden, ME",Apr 2017,The restaurant had variety for dinner. Sunset was one of the best sunsets. Do not swim here! Should be nice for relaxing too
CoisDeZweed,"Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands",Apr 2017,"The sea has nice waves here. Good spot to learn how to surf.It is not possible to swim at all areas, only between the flags. The sea is very rough and there is a strong current.Budget bar available at your left hand side when entering the beach. You can recognize this because they have crappy old chairs with a frozen image on it and only a cooler with drinks and also coconuts. These guys are very nice.Enjoy!"
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Apr 2017,"One of many around Kuta Beach, but less crowded than southern neighbor. Quite a lot of umbrellas and seats for rent available with a friendly locals providing tourists with snacks and drinks. Few good restaurants available just outside. "
Michele3062,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,Great at night to listen to live music all types of trios playing Casual bean bags to sit in enjoy a drink or some sisha Great for families teens adults 
Adrienne M,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Apr 2017,"Lots of beach bars and restaurants, good service and umbrellas and loungers easy to get, surf schools and surf board hire. Go for walks, swim or wait for the sunset parties. Music, beach soccer, volleyball, or watch the planes land on the island! Could be cleaner and dog owners should be made to pick up after their own dogs. "
Seaside46221,11 contributions,Apr 2017,"We took the extended family down to Double Six Beach to watch the sunset. Ages from 7 to 55. Grabbed beanbags at the Blue 9 Beach bar and settled in with drinks and pizzas to watch  the sunset and catch a few tunes. Very touristy, crowded with restaurants many with  music competing and if you are in a large group keep tabs on your bill, keep it simple and pay as you go is my tip. Accept it for what it is and you'll enjoy yourselves as we did."
leedskat,"Shadwell, UK",Apr 2017,I was really disappointed with this beach. There is loads of rubbish and overall a but grotty. There are loads of dogs roaming around just doing their business everywhere so was worried where I was walking. At sunset there is quite a nice buzz but overall it didn't live up to what I was expecting.
Karen_P2012,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,If you are used to living in a country with beautiful white sandy clean beaches then prepare to be a little bit shocked.  
vicri1607,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2017,Double six beach is famous....especially for sunset in seminyak area. The wave quite good for surfing even sometimes there is no wave (depend on season). U can enjoy ur sunset with drink or small bites...especially there is bakso there... there is so many small warung to chill out with standart price so dont worry.. so many locals or tourist to come here enjoy the sunset.... So dont miss it if u come to Bali..this place u must visit.. cheerrrsss
CrystaNatalie,"Orchard Road, Singapore",Feb 2017,"Love this beach, clean and nice sunset. Every afternoon we stayed here to drink beer and enjoyed nice sunset"
larrym0527,"Camas, Washington",Mar 2017,"Easy access beach with beautiful people, good surfing.  Water is very warm, shallow and safe for all ages."
Wahyus69,"Kuta, Indonesia",Mar 2017,Me and my wife were enjoy the beach and specially the cocktail so nice and refreshing combined with sunset on the horizon was great feeling   
Mal T,33 contributions,Mar 2017,"This part of the beach is nice with lots of cafe's and restaurants along the foreshore.   You can sit and watch the world go by in any one of these places.  Excellent place for sunsets.At night a number of the restaurants have live music and they set up tables, chairs and bean bags under lights on the sand.   Very nice. When we were there the waves were huge (great to watch) but that meant the ocean was not really swimmable."
vickyvic,36 contributions,Jan 2017,just a regular beach nothing great about this. more beaches in bali are better than this one. but not crowded
pingsjin3,"London, UK",Mar 2017,I really enjoy to spend time at evening/night at Double beach.Nice live music as well.Very chilling!
KayaOtah,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"Instagram likes to boast it with colorful seats and all, but the band wasnt really great, the beach wasnt pristine, i think W beach was better. "
Mike B,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Mar 2017,"This beach is filthy. So much garbage, even broken glass in the sand. It can be dangerous to walk barefoot. The sand is also a dirty grey. Not nice to look at, not nice to walk, overall terrible."
Roland D,"London, UK",Mar 2017,"The sea needs to be kept cleaner!   It had a greenish-brown tinge.  It was warm, though.  There are eateries and places to have massage.  You can rent loungers at 100,000 rupiah."
Natashya A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"The view is great. It was not that crowded that time. However, I still prefer to go to beach clubs than the beach alone."
tridiana34,"Bandung, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"like to spend the evenings in this location, enjoying the sunset. The beach is big and you can go for long walks but it is also very touristy and noisy and which was not a very nice experience."
Kris Sugiarto,"Pandaan, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"Perfect ambiance for family/couple afternoon walk. Don't forget to enjoy your time at some local cafe, sitting on the sand chair, order some pizza or beverages. Enjoy the air, the sound of waves, and the sun set! :D"
Lee T,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,We just picked our way between all the disgusting garbage bought in by the tide.  Not conducive to wanting to sit and drink etc.
SarahNJosh,"Midland, Australia",Mar 2017,"We had a lovely walk along double six beach after a nice meal at The Plantation Grill, would have stopped for a drink if we weren't so full from dinner "
euphorialicexz,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2017,"The place was smelly, and had rubbish strewn around. The sands were rough and grey, and the water was grey too. I've seen better beaches, so so disappointing!The beach clubs were more of a party-crowd place, and not really a place to relax. I went with my friend, just 2 of us girls. While we were walking around we were picked on by the locals there, cat-calling and being stared at. Didn't enjoy ourselves. but we noticed those who were in groups or with male companions, did not face such a problem. I think it's more of a surfer's paradise."
sonny222013,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",Mar 2017,"Loads of beach bars pull out their bean bags and umbrellas for sunset and crank the music up. It;s noisy and a bit chaotic but fun and relaxing all the same. Enjoy a drink,watch the waves and the sun go down."
losakos,"Loma Linda, CA",Mar 2017,Went to this beach with some misgivings after reading reviews. Sand was clean when we got there so that's nice! You can lounge under an umbrella with chairs as long as you purchase drinks from the guy whose territory it is. We sat at Monkey Bars. Super nice guy! Had drinks waiting for you as soon as you were done with the one in your hand. Water was deliciously warm. Bad parts? Trash EVERYWHERE in the water. So sad the amount of trash this ocean has. Plus the hawkers are very aggressive and are constantly coming up to you. Nonstop!!! 
Bintang Soepoetro,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"Nice place for seeing sunset. The beach is clean, clear sea water. Suitable for kids and family.Nice places for beer and snacking. However food is overpriced.Been here for two times, March 2016 and 2017"
Eve S,"St Andrews, Australia",Mar 2017,Wasn't impressed with Double 6 beach coz it was grey sand. I was surprised Kuta beach had white sand but still not as white as Australia's Huskinson Beach. 
Christine S,3 contributions,Mar 2017,"Great bars for day and evening relaxing. Food and drink are excellent value and the service is fantastic.  Sit on the bean bags outside the bars or sit inside in the day time for cooler air. Its gets hot out there.  Would highly recemmend a visit with friends, or even alone> people are friendly and you will not be short of conversation."
Pussycatmafia,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2017,Pop down to the beach and lay on the lounger while the staff cater for your every need...Umbrellas great service.. Love it.
Alex Valentin,10 contributions,Feb 2017,"Nice Beach to chill at the beach, a bit dirty probably because the rainy season. A lot of places to grab a drink and enjoy sunset.!"
FunkyMarshmallow,"Bournemouth, UK",Mar 2017,"This is one of the most disgustingly dirty beaches I have ever seen and I have travelled. The amount of rubbish washed up on the beach and not cleared away is a disgrace and an example of the crisis our oceans are suffering.  Why anyone would want to come and sit on it and look out at the rubbish is beyond me and why any Aussie would come from the beautiful beaches in Australia to surf here is crazy.  I went for an early morning run and had to wash my trainers after because I ran through the streams that led into the sea, the smell was so bad, god knows what is in that water and now in the sea."
Suraj B,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2017,"just a beautiful beach, with a  wide area to walk enjoy the sunset, breeze and moonlight. plenty of cafes to choose from with varying genre of music to suit all taste buds. and some live music as well. was a peach."
Jenry D,"Klotten, Germany",Feb 2017,"Beautiful Beach, but it was kinda dirty. A lot of Plastic rubbish on the beach. Maybe it was very very bad Weather for 4 days.But I hope they will clean it.On Sunday was very crowded, many local people as well, they played football on the beach.Otherwise we love the beach."
muldoonchris,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2017,Great beach front restaurants that allow you to lounge on bean bag chairs while watching the sunset.Food was off good quality at fair prices. Not as many hawkers as Kuta and Legian
Danpau,"Glasgow, UK",Mar 2017,"Very long beach, plenty of bed and places to drink.Pestered a lot by people selling stuff or trying to get you to select their beds.No place to shower or even rinse your feet.Lot of stray dogs aboutLots of debris on the beach, including animal dirt!!!Could do with serious clean up.No life guards on beach at all, slough coloured warning flags posted throughout."
Aashish Chauhan,"Greater London, UK",Aug 2016,"There are many restaurant and bars that setup in the evening which play live music while you lounge on large bean bags under a umbrella while being next to the beach.  Lovely place to be, highly recommended."
Faye S,Australia,Jun 2016,Excellent hotel...went out of their way to make our stay an amazing experience.  When the room we were allocated was too noisy we asked if possible we could be moved.  Not a problem ....and we were very lucky to get an upgrade so we were very happy.
Jade C,6 contributions,Feb 2017,"A beach that would've been so relaxing and a great spot for us, however during wet season it was littered as far as the eye could see with washed up plastic and rubbish. Even walking you could see it in the waves as well. We were asked for 100.000IDR for two beach seats for an hour, others offered less but I assume it was a busy time. Plenty of bars and loungers around if you've come from far.Great spot for the day but watch the trash season, we didn't swim at all.Visited February 2017"
gailchapman,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2017,"Disappointing with the hawkers constantly harassing you to buy something every 2minutes. Sunset was lovely however the area did smell unpleasant. Hired the deck chairs/umbrellas for $7AUD for two people for the afternoon, but the first person to approach asked us for $25AUD. Still, the $7 was probably by no means a bargain, neither were the prices any of the hawkers offered, be they for goods or services. "
Heather B,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2017,So nice and peaceful. Very relaxing siting on bean bags. Could easily have fallen asleep. Will visit again 
Lucy B,13 contributions,Feb 2017,"Large busy beach, not white sand if that's what your hoping for. Lots of bars along the beach and sun loungers available during the day, bean bags in the evening. We came in the set season so there is litter deposited on the beach constantly. This does rather spoil it, though there are sections of much cleaner sand and clear blue sea. There are sellers constantly trying to sell their wares. This is a lovely beach to sit and watch the sunset. For a day at the beach I would rather go to nusa dua, we may have been lucky but it was very quiet, no sellers and very clean! "
ClaireT79,"Phuket, Thailand",Feb 2017,"This beach is dirty and very busy every 10 steps you are approached by people, who are nice and friendly but who want to sell you a  bed. After 10 minutes we had to get off the beach. This might be fun in the evening but not so nice during the day. Definatly not a pretty beach if you like nice beaches do not go here in rainy season they have a serious rubbish problem and while the goverment is trying by cleaning 3 times a day, in rainy season sadly it seems a lost cause."
Michael C,182 contributions,Nov 2016,"This is a great beach for simply hanging out, so many chilled bars to stop by with everything from coffees to fruit juices to everyones favourite tipples!As far as going in the sea, be careful, depending on tides the sea can unfortunately be full of rubbish and waste, its very bad and a big example of why we should all be a bit more eco! It was certainly a wake up call for us but dont let that put you off enjoying the wonderful beach and the brilliant vibrance of the sunsets, all the bars come alive with singing acts, djs and more, find yourself everything from a massive beanbag to a comforable couch, kick back and enjoy"
Chris C,"Honolulu, HI",Feb 2017,This section of the beach is more well maintained than adjoining ares along the beach front. There is a more visible effort to remove the trash from the evening before prior to morning visitors arriving. All in all the beaches in Bali are average at best. These are not the powdery sand beaches other places have to offer. The sand is more gritty and course.
Marcus O,6 contributions,Dec 2016,"this is the best beach compared to Kuta...great for familys and groups,many very friendly beach bars that will cater to almost whatever you want..swimming is great for little and big kids..has surf life savers on duty all day,many delicious cheap local food stalls and easy to get to..the sunsets are awsome and after there are some great restaurants to choose a place for dinner..safest beach in my oppinion for swimming"
rowanc932,33 contributions,Feb 2017,"Went down and walked along this beach, had some decent size waves. Surfers everywhere offering you surf lessons which is nice if you wanted to learn. There are seats everywhere which cost to sit on them and charge by the hour which I think it cost roughly 50,000 for 1hr. Good to check out but quite a busy beach! Be careful when swimming as the current is super strong! Would recommend checking this place out!"
buaya40,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Feb 2017,"The beach has black sand and is not so cozy as is described in the leaflets. Although separated from the main area, sellers of all kind of products annoyingly demand attention for their merchandise."
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Feb 2017,"Without doubt probably the busiest of all the Bali beaches.This is where you will find your more formal beach bars where you can get a comfy bean bag to sit on , a cocktail in your hand whilst nibbling on tasty tapas.Not as many beach sellers up this way as Kuta in the south but plenty more eateries up this end of town , many of which have good lighting to set the mood for a relaxing or romantic night out."
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2017,"This is one of the busier beaches in the area and that brings both pluses and minuses. Because there are some nice hotels around the prices in shops and restaurants and to be dearer than in other areas and it does get very busy. Having said that, it also means a lot of facilities for you to enjoy and we had some great fun there. There is lots to do whether you want exercise or relaxation ‚Äì you can hire sun beds with umbrellas quite cheaply. There are many places to eat of a good quality and we also used it for exercise by having fast walks along it. "
Geet,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,The water was not the cleanest. Overall a nice beach experience however I was expecting a lot more off it
caserj,"Dallas, Texas",Feb 2017,.. Beach is good... several good beach bars.. B9B is a good one right there at Double Six Road.  Lots of good restaurants and some good shopping.
Kyksta,Singapore,Feb 2017,"Love double 6 beach, always pay a visit when we are in Bali. My 4 kids had a 2 hour surf lesson there and absolutely loved it. Restaurants and great market/ shops near by. Then you have Jalan Legian/seminyak which is full of cool shops. Highly recommended üòä"
Bernadette B,"Queensland, Australia",Feb 2017,"A very cool trendy bar. Overlooks the ocean, fabulous for sunset drinks or a night out. Especially love the pods!"
Toby Cheong,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,restaurants are plentiful for you to choose from and they are quite despo at times.very relaxing by the beach watching the sunset but the beach was rather dirty and not much cleaning.
Lovetravelling57,"Karratha, Australia",Jan 2017,"We enjoy sitting on the bean bags listening to the music, watching the sunset! The hawkers are rather annoying and should know when to leave you alone!"
Emily W,10 contributions,Jul 2016,Good for sun but and nice experience in double six beach . The location . Restaurant close by fantastic 
Collins2402,"Warialda, Australia",Jan 2017,Was filthy the day we went and the beach was littered with rubbish.Iam sure its not like this all the time.
Deborah T,"South Fremantle, Australia",Jan 2017,Stay away. Run by Javanese gangs.  Scary place and not safe for tourists. Syringe found on beach. Murdered policeman found here on beach in August last year. 
Miss Afianty,23 contributions,Feb 2017,Nice and closest beach to my place. Good place to hangout and just have a sit by the beach. Should try the famous bakso (meatballs).
Victoria E,8 contributions,Feb 2017,Just dark sand. Nothing special to say about this beach. Good for a walk. No way to swim in this dirty water. Nice to sit and watch the waves from the bar.
Sandy B,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,"This beach is very dirty and really only good for sunsets, rubbish everywhere and your constantly hassled by people trying to sell you something. The sand is dirty and almost black! "
Rima EK,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"The beach is big, nothing I haven't seen before. The sunset was rewarding for the pictures taken. It's a nice place to sit and relax but the highlight of my day here was learning how to surf. A sports I never knew was so difficult yet I loved it and would do it all over again! If you come here, make sure to learn it, it's worth it!"
tonyneville23,"Ballarat, Australia",Jan 2017,"The beach was dirty and covered in litter probably due to the rains, some bars were okay but an excessive amount of people selling trinkets . Even though this is their lively hood when you say no it means no and leave me alone."
Taipei921,Singapore,Jan 2017,"A private beachfront shared on a wide expanse of beach with strong waves. Many surfing instructors dot the beach touting their expertise. Beach washes up a huge amount of sand bed, which colored the waves with brown sediments while the waves further out are blue. Nice for sunsets and strolling, though the filth and debris washed ashore this time of year spoilts the prestine beach image. Not suitable for swimming, especially with the sand in the waves and the strong waves now (red flags warning).Free towel, beach chair, and ice cold mineral water for guests of Double Six and Courtyard Seminyak. Friendly attendant John."
DarwinWendy,Darwin,Jan 2017,"I like to spend the evenings in this location, enjoying the sunset while listening to live music and consuming a few bintangs. Ca be a bit annoying with people trying to sell you things however with a simple no they usually leave you alone."
lululaura1234567,"Montreal, Canada",Aug 2016,"The beach is big and you can go for long walks but it is also very touristy and noisy and we saw a lot of trash on the beach, which was not a very nice experience."
Madeleine W,96 contributions,Jan 2017,"We went for stroll along tis beach on our first day considering it was very close to our villa. Honestly, not the worst beach but definitely not the cleanest. I can imagine when it's peak season, it is saturated with tourist and locals alike so there would be a lot of rubbish and coming here in January which is wet season, the daily rain and some down pours doesn't help with making the beach dirtier. Each beach side cafe/restaurant have the same beach set up with umbrellas, bean bags and tables on the beach and a set up in the middle facing the venue for live performers to entertain. "
The Yum L,556 contributions,Dec 2016,"In general all the beaches along this side of Bali are not particularly clean. When you've come from pristine Australian waters, these beaches cannot compare. There are great surf schools, a long stretch of beach, and lots of beach bars and cafes along the edge though which make up for the lack of cleanliness."
John M,"Parkland, FL",Jan 2017,"It's there & nice to walk along--but, you spend a lot of time watching where you step. The trash is everywhere. JUst NOT pleasant! "
AAlnazawi,18 contributions,Jan 2017,What made me sad is the amount of trash along the beach but overall the beach was great and sunset was one of the best sunsets i ever seen 
John T,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,As a beach person I can only advise that I have never seen a more polluted beach or water as here. Do not swim is my advise.
scost67,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Loved the cleanliness of the property! Our room was everything we were expecting and more! Great view! The restaurant had variety for dinner and the staff are always  more than willing to help where they can! Can't wait to go back 
Chrisjech,Surabaya,Jan 2017,"The conditions of the beach is not well maintained, there are a lot of plastic waste, empty bottle drink, food wrappers were brought on shore. Besides, this place is a nice for beginner to learn how to surf. "
Grazia C,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach here is typical of beaches on this side of Bali, lovely for a walk or run, just dipping your toes or good for experienced surfers. Beware of the tow! The most positive aspect of this beach is watching the glorious sunsets and the fact that local Balinese families sometimes use  this beach to conduct traditional religious Ceremonies. The Ceremonies can be a rewarding cultural experience to observe ( in an unobtrusive and respectful manner).I have read some of the other reviews and from time to time the area can become quite polluted, although I understand that in recent years, local hotels pay to have the beaches cleaned regularly and there seems to be much more pride in the way the beaches are maintained."
1310greg,"Darwin, Australia",Jan 2017,"If you want to relax, swim, buy a beer and enjoy a sun lounge - this beach is the best.  Choose a bar opposite Furama and the ladies have a great, easy toilet option that will meet with first world approval.The hawkers soon realise what you are into and what not - a simple 'tidak, tidak' (no, no) generally means: ""not interested, go away""."
LindyHaynes,"Geelong, Victoria, Australia",Dec 2016,we visited in the December 2016... obviously there was a current that bought all the rubbish mainly plastic onto the beaches... you really couldn't swim or sit on the beach at all... was even too scared to be bare feet... I have never seen to much plastic in all my life... even though there were workers and tractors day in and day out.. the mess kept coming in....
JorgeLuisHM,779 contributions,Dec 2016,This beach is almost for surfers only; as other travelers have written most of the public beaches are so filthy!; good opportunity to take a bite or beverage to enjoy sunset and nightlife.
Andrew D,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,Nice beach (for Bali) with the usual small bars and chairs/tables/umbrellas which is cleaned in the morning of debris (i.e. rubbish).  The touts come regularly selling the usual stuff.  Beware of the prices (cut the first price by 80% at least).  Cold beer can be had for about 20k-30k.
Alan F,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"I was shocked to see a beach that dirty- empty bottles and cans are scattered around, not a very nice walk on that beach. Can't go there with little kids! Also, can't swim because of waves, but looks like to be good for surfing - surfers seemed like having fun. "
Sazza,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,"The beaches are lined with rubbish and litter everywhere. A real shame really. A lot of locals trying to sell you things too, which is ok, but gets really annoying when you're trying to chill and they won't leave you alone. "
Al Ross,"Vientiane, Laos",Jan 2017,"66 is a great place to hangout and have a few cheap drinks in the sun, before heading off to a restaurant or bars for the evening.Please note the recent comments stating the beach is covered in litter is a yearly event at this time of the year due to the predominant wind direction. Yes; the beach has more litter on it at this time of the year due to this, but all the beach boys and others working on the beach do their utmost to clean up as much as they can."
david d,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"Gone is the Bali or old. There's simply no excuse for the filth we behold: piles of garbage topping 6' in places, and miles of garbage stretching south and north as far as the eye can see. To make matters even worse, the return of the beanbag chair, filled with styrofoam pellets, has arrived, and all the bars north of Double 6 sport them...and they leak. So now we have millions of white styrofoam pellets added to the cigarette butts, plastic food wrappers, containers, bags and FSM knows what else. The UN should intervene. Large ashtray barrels should be deployed, fines should be posted, bulldozers brought in and darn it someone should rectify this environmental disaster. Stay away. Go to Thailand, go to Lombok, just go anywhere but here. The beautiful Balinese people are in for a rough ride if this persists."
sandcall,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"My partner & I recently returned from Bali. As I'm a beach lover, while on our trip away, decided to go to the beach. I was totally shocked. There was litter everywhere, from plastic bottles, to rubbish, diapers & everything else. The water even had a oily surface as well. When we travelled to Bali 2 years ago, the beach was nothing like what we experienced that day. It was so disappointing. Not sure what the problem is. We asked a few locals & they said because of the rain, all the litter was from Java. Not sure how true this is. They also said that the beach gets cleaned but I was skeptical about that."
BGcat,"Kidderminster, UK",Jan 2017,"I have never been so shocked at the state of a beach. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's covered in litter! It's all washed up along the sand down the whole stretch of the beach, even as you walk ankle deep in the water rubbish brushes past and on your feet - disgusting! There's even a huge digger regularly driving by with entire loads of rubbish back and forth trying to clear it. It's shocking! The colour of the sand is grey, not surprisingly. And the water is literally brown, when the waves break and it should be white froth it's actually brown froth. It's vile, and shockingly unhygienic. I'd be genuinely concerned to swim it... certainly not with broken skin or cuts. It's so clearly dirty, don't risk it. Sadly the beach itself with this view and surroundings is nowhere to relax either.  The worst beach I've ever seen. How sad to see what we're all going to the planet. Maybe go see it for yourself as it's quite harrowing, but absolutely not somewhere to go for vacation or to relax/enjoy. "
navpreet k,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,similar on the lines of seminyak beach..you can spend your evenings here eating drinking.. it has relatively less crowd..only 2 3 restaurants on the beach
WillemJanssen,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2017,"After looking forward to the normally great beach in Seminyak, I was really disappointed to see the the beach was transformed in a plastic garbage belt. People where doing their best to clean it up, but with every tide it just washed up again. For swimming and surfing you just had to get used to have plastic wash up against your body all the time, not really great but you get used to it.If Bali doesn't manage to get rid of the plastic, I would seriously reconsider coming to Bali again in the future..."
Alan M,"Millbrae, CA",Dec 2016,"We are pretty spoiled in Australia & New Zealand for the cleaniness of our beaches. Unfortunately, the beaches we went to in Seminyak were full of rubbish & a bit smelly in places. Really takes away from the experience. However, we did enjoy a nice sunset which was lovely, and the photos couldn't pick up the rubbish!"
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Rubbish everywhere...i saw an elderly man stepped onto a broken beer bottle...poor man...there are piles of rubbish...
damjan74,"Poljcane, Slovenia",Dec 2016,"Maybe it's in some other time great beach, but for New Years time it's to windy and too dirty.. but still nice place to see sun sets üëå "
Roberto_Predonzan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"I have been there many times. It is the typical tourist beach with sun bed, umbrellas, restaurants ... It is nice normally and very good for sunset. Many surfers and many surf schools (easy). This December the beach was full of garbage, a mess, we just walked couple of meters and went away.  At the end of the trip we went back there for a drink in a small restaurant on the beach and we were watching a wheel loader removing the garbage ... not amazing!"
Phil4218,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2016,"Due to the large seas for several days, the litter was horrendous. Some attempt had been mad to pile the rubbish up but there was rubbish everywhere. That said, it's not always that bad"
scm454,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,Delicious lunch served  by attentive staff while  looking over the sparkling pool to the beach in front of Double Six. Loved the glass room where the cold meats were kept and sliced as needed.
Joanne D,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,Bit windy on me days and its a shame this time of the year rubbish comes in with the tide But nice to watch sunset and drink with some lovely stall owners 
Brian R,"Aarhus, Denmark",Jan 2017,Plastic and other debris litter the beach from the sun beds to the surf. Lots of vendors. But the surfers seemed to like the waves.
Anuj G,"Vadodara, India",Dec 2016,This beach is nice place to enjoys ur evening at a beach in Bali having nice cafe and restaurants and music üé∂ 
YChan2016,Malaysia,Dec 2016,Sad to say that we were disappointed as the Beach experienced a major wash-up of rubbish when we visited.  There are definitely much nicer beaches in Uluwatu and Nusa Dua. 
Royal80E,"Turku, Finland",Dec 2016,This beach is also covered by trash. One of the most disgusting beaches where I have visited. Sea is full of floating un identified objects! Beware. Bali officials and local (and also tourists) should really take more care about the enviroment. Tourists will definately go away if the most beautiful paradise is ruined!!!!
Timothy,"Boras, Sweden",Dec 2016,"the morning fter a large rainfall this beach is covered with trash. It's pretty bad and most of the beach is not cleaned fast enough. in front of some of the pricey hotels it is clean, but the regular areas close to the bars really doesn't get cleaned. saw syringes, light bulbs, glass, metal cans, tons of plastic bags and bottles. it's a shame that such a beautiful place is not kept up better and shame on the people who can't dispose of things in a civil way."
KrisNYC006,"New York City, NY",Dec 2016,"I loved the Italian restaurant, it was amazing. The pasta's in particular were very good. Best sunset drinks on the rooftop. "
lynette291,"Pretoria, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Area covered in filth - unmentionable objects drifting in the water! Avoid at all cost, vendors are a constant irritation - do yourself a favour and go somewhere else"
cv247,"Berlin, Germany",Dec 2016,i booked some surfing lessons in one of the many places at double six beach.unfortunately during the rain season especially in december wind direction etcturn the beach in a pile of rubbish.literarily unusable.just don't waste your time going there at all in this time of the year
charstorti,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,"Great for sunset on  the beach with a cocktail or 10.... bars  line the beaches, beanbags on  the beach, live music in the background, great atmosphere"
Karin E,"Royal Oak, MI",Dec 2016,"This beach looks so beautiful from afar, but get closer, and you'll see waves of garbage sweeping up on shore, apparently from recent storms.  What a shame.  Don't swim here, or even walk on the beach, unless you want a nasty infection.  What a waste of our beach vacation."
Princess_Ronna,"Xi'an, China",Dec 2016,"We came here to eat on the beach for some local cuisine.  The evening we came, the wind was blowing so hard and the waves were out of this world!  It was CRAZY!  It was fun watching the waves as we ate."
Rina Cannon (N√©e Purba),"Chennai (Madras), India",Dec 2016,I was there recently and found that this beach was good for surfing. You can rent surf boards at the beach and enjoy a quite high waves. 
Sep3ani,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2016,Many place must go in Bali. Double six is one of them. You can enjoy sunset there while drink a bottle of beer. Many restaurant and shop around. You can also try to go to surf school there. 
Vidhu,17 contributions,Dec 2016,"You can learn to surf here,  sit down by the beach bars,  watch the gorgeous sunset.  A tad crowded though,  vibrant,  good place to people watch.  "
Chow Ming,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,I gave a try to surf after a lunch at seminyak.  The wave was not world class but still surfable.  A lot of surf schools around which worth to have a lesson there for first time surfers.The only bad there was the garbbish problem. Hoping the government will do something on it.
Tachyang Lee,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"The beach was covered to litters, and although some surfers were there. I seriously doubt it is safe to be in the water.The color of the sea water were brown and murky, ee were disappointed and did not stay there long.It needs a thorough clean up badly!"
sarahs_rafee3,Bahrain,Dec 2016,"The beach is generally okay, the tide had brought so much trash, couldn't swim because the beach is so dirty and has big waves, many surfers, lots of street sellers that try to sell random things on the beach, the beach chair rentals are around 50k each"
ChrisPrice12345,"Karuizawa-machi, Japan",Dec 2016,"Spend some time at La Plancha (their seafood is good) and its the place to be for sunset.  Good place to people watch. I don't surf, but there are a lot of schools helping beginners. As always on a non reef beach, be careful the sea is dangerous and kills.  Buy a little from the ladies and men trying so hard to support their families, even if you don't need it!"
KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Walked along this beach whilst on a transit overnight in Seminyak. The beach is dirty and horrible. Rubbish everywhere. Just don't understand why it's so popular.
Dan L,"Bunbury, Australia",Dec 2016,"My wife came to the beach for a swim, I accompanied for a look. The prevailing winds and tides have not done any favours for Bali beaches in this area, mountains of rubbish collected and being disposed of and still more incoming. As with adjacent beaches, local authorities assisted by hotel and restaurant staff and other volunteers have achieved remarkable success and still collect incoming. Some hardy swimmers and surfers in the water. Still open for business with plenty of seats, umbrellas, touts, massages, etc. on offer. Some excellent restaurants and cafes beachside. Great effort to tackle the rubbish problem."
AndyS,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,"Pros: Good waves, fairly clean, many restaurants and cafes for meals.Cons: No place to leave your belongings (lockers)I was told Double Six had strong waves great for surfing. Only problem was i don't surf. But i can swim (or so i'm told) so the strong waves are good fun to splash around in. The beach is well maintained so it's clean. Unless you ended up at a sorry spot where it does get quite stinky so just walk around, it's quite a big beach. You'd also see hundreds of tanning beds available for rent. 2 beds and an umbrella are about 100k depending on your bargaining skills (i suck at it). And yeah, drinks are on the house with each bed. No they aren't. Prices are quite standard for beers and cocktails.If you're riding your motorbike over, do take note that they will ask for about 1K (if, i'm not wrong) to enter the area."
Anni H,"Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand",Dec 2016,"I come to beach to relax and at this beach it was nearly impossible. I rent a long chair and half a second after I had sat down the vendors started to sell all kind of stuff from sunglasses to bracelets. I counted and within 15 minutes 12 vendors had stopped by. That was very annoying. However, after the vendors had left me alone I had fun sunbathing and watching surfers catching waves.Beautiful beach but I prefer smaller and quieter ones.Tip: Buy big headphones and keep them on. They leave you alone quicker when you are ""deaf"".üòé"
Ali202,"Noosa, Australia",Dec 2016,So much rubbish that it turned your stomach at the thought of walking through it and swimming in it .. did not do it and constantly getting harassed with people trying to sell you stuff when you are trying to relax !!
Lia D,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"Best view and atmosphere for sun, sand and sea activities.Great venue and a must place to go when you're in Bali"
Broncos06,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,"We were told by all tour guides and locals about this must visit beach. It was incredibly dirty and littered. The drain pipe leading directly onto the beach is filled with rubbish, there are piles of rubbish at the entrance to the beach. It would be a good place to go surfing with good strong waves. Also the beach is lined with restaurants and cafes which would have been nice to eat at except it started to rain shortly after arriving"
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"Spent an afternoon session here with mini grom. Waves breaking a little way off shore, rented a couple of boards from local operator. Ended up ripping a fin out from one board (cost Rp 40.000 to replace) due to beach conditions.All good."
reindeerchronicles_,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"Sure the beach could be a little littered, but which beach isn't? Do visit for nice views and it's definitely a place to chill out!"
cjragu,"Coimbatore, India",Nov 2016,This lovely beach is clean and wonderful for surfing!! In the evening it becomes colorful both at the horizon and at the bank!! Excellent beach side restaurants to serve the food and drink of your choice!! Enjoy one evening!!
Aggie86jankus,Australia,Nov 2016,"The beach itself is dirty! Even tho once the rubbish is cleaned up on the beach, the water is full with plastic, paper and all sorts of rubbish!! Can't go for a swim without some trash wrapping around your arm or something floating around in your face. Entertainment wise it is a GREAT lil spot, cool lil bars, live music in evening. So not all bad, just not great for a chilled nice beachy day in the water."
annettematheson,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,Double Six has its own private beach straight across the road should you choose to relax by the beach. We used this quite a bit.
Jessica W,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,One thing I hate about Bali's main beaches is that during the day they are not tranquil. We paid to rent sunloungers and surf boards and could not get any peace when we weren't in the surf. The beach is otherwise beautiful.
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"Average beach, but too many touters irritating you. trying to sell things and promote services. will avoid in future."
annasmithwilson,"Australian Capital Territory, Australia",Oct 2016,"very nice beach,clean and we will come again next year.we take sun bath and play on the beach.people very humble here."
Chelly21,"Ubud, Indonesia",Nov 2016,A great place to have a little something to eat and drink while you watch the sunset over Seminyak. Staff are polite and quick to serve you.
Chrystal62,"Barrydale, South Africa",Nov 2016,Nice beach with lots of activities and small waves for swimming/ learning to surf but the amount of people that come up to you to sell stuff is ridiculous. Every 5 minutes I had someone come up to me and not leave until I had said no at least three times sometimes more. I am always polite and calm but some people take advantage of that and just stand there for ages after you have said no. It was so off putting especially as I was lying on my own for the most part a hubby was learning to surf. We left after an hour. I do not recommend.
Muzza59,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,We went to K Resto on Double Six Beach. The food was fantastic. So nice sitting on the beach watching the sunset and having a drink. A bit quieter than some of the other bar/restaurants but we really liked it.
sneha s,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2016,"Awesome shacks , food. And music The sunset is breathtaking U can just sit here and forget the rest of the world "
Li W,"Bendigo, Australia",Nov 2016,"Very nice beach ,cleaning up of all the rubbish was in progress,sea was calm ,hardly anyone there as early morning ."
berawA69,"Canggu, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"This is one of the most known beaches, in car difficult to reach, to much local people trying u to sell stuff expensive, the beach get cleaned up, but next to a rivermouth!"
geeky_ninja,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,"A very busy and long beach. So clean and relaxing. Lots of different flags with different meanings can be confusing for first timers.  Saw a man drowning and screaming for help, he was not being watched whilst swimming alone.  Ran to alert guards and he was rescued in time.  "
Jmg567,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2016,"So many little restaurants and bars along this beach which is massive during low tide. Take your pick, pull up a bean bag and  watch the sunset listening to live music. Pro Tip - The local surf school guys who rent the sun beds sell ice cold bintang for half the price of most of the restaurants."
Chris O,3 contributions,Nov 2016,"I love to see the sunset, its stunning. Good place to relax and just enjoy the nature. recommend place when you are in seminyak."
DeneLodding,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Walking out from the double Six hotel and onto the beach was fantastic, any time of the day, we when down to watch the sunset, we sat down and relaxed with a couple drinks and a few nibbles, comfortable relaxing and staff are great,   fantastic way to end YES another perfect day in Bali."
ronmetcalfe,"Corindi, Australia",Nov 2016,We relaxed on the beach at Andy's Bar the beer was ice cold and Andy was one of the nices guys I have ever met could not do enough for you if your on the Double six beach look for Andy's Bar on the umbrella's as so much better then the other bars you will not be disappointed cheap beer also give him a try
Amy C,27 contributions,Sep 2016,Incredibly crowded on a Sunday. The sand is a dark brown and I could see that there were oil spills before. It's okay if you want to sit and chill on a beanbag (many restaurants offering that) but I think you'd be better off at Jimbaran or some other more secluded beach. There are some smelly small streams that separate the beaches. 
DiAplo,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Nov 2016,Clean flat and giant beach. This is probably the hot spot of Bali where you can learn to surf or just chilax.
katie,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,"There are a lot of bars along the beach side which you could just grab a beer, pick a bean bag and watch the sun goes down. Such an amazing experience. "
inoe u,45 contributions,Oct 2016,"Long beach with a lot of beach bars. So many options for relaxing in all the bars, you can rent the relax chairs, or you can enjoying on the regular chair only with buying their beers or soda. Safe for children and pets friendly. But this beach isn't for waves breaker. Looking for beautiful sunset? This place is definitely one of the best spot."
clem c,"Royan, France",Nov 2016,The beach has several beach bars with sun loungers for hire in front of them. Surf boards for hire and the surf on the 2 days we were there seemed only average but good for beginers with a choice of surf schools. As the sun sets all the beach bars set up comfy beach bean bags with lit up tables and most provide live music. While the food is just snacks it was a great way to start the evening. There are also shops just off the beach to buy your bottles of water and sun tan cream.
Johanna R,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Not the best stretch of beach in the popular tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak etc.  They are doing up the beach along the Legian Beach Hotel/ Mandira section which is further down (towards airport) and also the Seminyak section but seems to be leaving Double Six out.  There are heaps of restaurants/ bars etc along this stretch but its full of scooters and not very clean.  The beach itself is OK but to increase business for the traders there, they need to clean up the street that runs along this section of beach.  I love Bali anyway and the sunset can be amazing from any point along this beach!!"
Armaminta,"Cobram, Australia",Sep 2016,"We were at this beach most days.  Most of the days it was beautiful weather and the beach was clean.  The first day we arrived there it was around 2pm.  I pretty much knew the price of the umbrellas and chairs so paid that.  Two hours later the guy came to take them and said it was only a two hour price.  He wanted 50000 for two hours which is more than the daily rate.  I told him I was not impressed and he said, ok, go somewhere else.   We did.  My daughters also got their hair braided on the beach.  One daughter paid 100000 and the other paid 150000 ( her hair was very very long and very thick)  this was much cheaper than anywhere else we found and included beads.  You can choose your own colour beads.  There is a constant flow of people offering things.  We mostly didn't mind as the children wanted to buy fairy floss, laser pointers etc.  Pedicures, manicures, all very cheap and reasonable 25000.  Don't expect a first class job but the girls loved the little flowers on their fingers and toes.  We ate dinner there one night, 8 in our group and were stunned at how reasonable it was.  We all ate and drank including beer and some seafood and it cost about $80AUD The live music right there on the sand was great.  So relaxing.  The kids got to run around and play, we danced to the music.  Everyone here is happy and relaxed, it is beautiful.  "
July's M,2 contributions,Oct 2016,"very nice place and nice view, feel relaxing with the sand. it's nice for sunset too, this place is recomended :)"
Truthful Reviews,"London, UK",Oct 2016,"Came here in October while staying close by.  It is a very common beach, busy and reminded me of an over crowded beach in Spain where all the Brits go.  People playing ball games and frisby.  Not a time to relax and chill if you go here."
LisaDolphingirlbyron,"Byron Bay, Australia",Oct 2016,Not as nice as SEMINYAK - or Ullawatu or BINGIN BEACH -Just OK - GREAT TO LEARN TO SURF -- But you do get hassled a lot to buy things
tazman1099,"Houston, TX",Nov 2016,"Beach here isn't amazing.  The sand is not white powder, it's dark and has dirt mixed in.  Okay for lounging.  The city has made efforts to clean it up, so there is less trash laying around, but it's still a problem.However, the sunsets are amazing!  If the horizon isn't hazy, the colors in the sky will definitely impress you!"
emu255103,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,"go here in the afternoon for drinks and pub food and watch the sunset, live music at all bars between 5pm and 10pm,sit on a bean bag right on the beach while you eat and drink, gets busy at these times but worth it, great ambience and a good night out until around 10PM,heaps of bars to choose from, all on the beach. top spot "
Andrew F,"Watford, UK",Nov 2016,Double six is a wide stretch of sandy beach with lots of bed chairs and lots of hawkers trying to make a living out of the tourists selling all kinds of stuff from feet scraping to mangos!!  sea can be fairly rough and there's a surf school based there can be a bit dirty in places but not a bad place to spend a day or two 
Luke Melbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Great to find a bar to sit for drinks and sunsets , but I wouldn't go swiming, very rough and dirty sand, although suprisingly clear of actual rubbish."
Lloyd R,"Victoria, Canada",Nov 2016,"Great Beach for surfing and boogey boarding ,Great area for bars and Bistros. spent 3 days here and loved it. No rocks or coral just some great waves and fun."
417anetth,"Szigliget, Hungary",Oct 2016,"it is usually a famous beach with thousand of people. In October, however, we found it rather calm and clean. Waves were perfect and the ocean was clean, too. There are many bars with special atmosphere and there is a very good surf school on the beach (santai surf)"
Dvdson_au,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Perfect place to enjoy the beautiful sunset spot while you enjoy the beer. Many beach lounges offers the good price for drink and food, so lovely!"
Sapna G,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,"We did our beginner surf lessons on this beach. Had so much fun! The waves were pretty strong, so it is not the best for leisurely swimming, but if you are into jumping waves, it is truly the best."
KMR92,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,Water is so beautiful. Beach is clean. Lovely to sit and relax with a BINTANG watching the sunset Hawkers can be frustrating but we just told them no. 
flamboyanku,"Bandung, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"We've just holiday at Bali for couple days, it‚Äôs  5***** luxurious hotel  I can't say enough ,check in was super and  great,The staff were welcoming and friendly ,  Breakfast at  was wonderful with selection menu delicious make complete my holiday  we highly recommend this hotel and definitely will come back"
Graham C,"Renton, WA",Nov 2016,This is a pleasant quieter beach mainly fronted by luxury resorts in Seminyak. The only drawback is the main access point on Jalan Arjuna has a stream of waste water from town emptying into the ocean. In the evenings the bars along the beach often have live music.
Julz6969,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Nov 2016,"The best sunsets ever, their AMAZING.. Bars,restaurants,music,sellers,Everbody goes to sunset in Bali..HAPPY DAYS...."
timothyb270,"Paisley, UK",Oct 2016,"Great for surfing, swimming, strolling or just relaxing with a drink. Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Take time to look as there are a few gems."
india70,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2016,Double Six was overcrowded and it was difficult to get a drink. The beanbags look nice to sit on but the sand is black so your feet get really dirty. It felt really commercial and it was difficult to see the sunset due to so many people on the beach.I prefer Legian Beach as it is whiter and less formal with small family run beach bars.The traffic was terrible......I would go very early if you are travelling by car as it takes up to an hour just from Jalan Laksmana.
sinthamahardi,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"This beach located in the heart of Kuta, it is bit busy. A lot of young spend their times in here, but it is great for family too."
Mark H,Sydney,Sep 2016,"Great to walk across.. however, it is quite dirty. There is a lot of rubbish swept up across the beach.You're also expected to pay 200,000 IDR per person to ""rent"" the chairs - which really just didn't seem worth it. At first we thought it was a scam, but they were serious (we think?) - made us quite uncomfortable and so we left. "
Well_Traveld_Dorson,"Wellington, New Zealand",Oct 2016,"Huge stretches of golden sand, hot sun, and epic surf make this hard to beat as a beach spot to relax. We stayed at the Double Six resort across the road making it an awesome experience. Just be aware locals will try and sell you their trinkets? while you are there"
Roni S,"Queensland, Australia",Nov 2015,"Had a wonderful experience here: morning walks along beach, interesting people & wonderful food. Even got to hold an albino python - absolutely beautiful. Can horse ride on beach, learn to surf, close to shops, walking distance to many great venues"
Savannahmystique,"Munich, Germany",Oct 2016,This beach is better than Kuta beach Especially if you walk a bit further to the direction of kudeta the wave is big and nice to swim or surf 
SinkingSeabourn,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Oct 2016,"During the day Double Six Beach is just another Bali beach but at night time it becomes a massive entertainment centre with live bands, lots of food and alcohol, all very cheap."
Chandra G R,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"Double Six Beach is at the border of Legian and Seminyak, at the end of Jalan Nakula, after it turnes into Jl Arjuna.  The beach is 'raked' clean each morning by a large green tractor, as well as by the various chaise lounge vendors.  There is surf, and several surf schools at Double 6; yet usually it is still mild enough to invite swimmers and children to play.  There are some vendore, though much less than at Kuta, and really are not bothersome..  Double Six is great for taking a morning stroll, and excellent for watching the sunset !  There is usually music, from the chair vendors, and from the hotel swimming pool across the street."

Robert v,47 contributions,Sep 2016,"Some of the best sunbeds I've encountered on Bali, really thick and perfect to relax on. It's always quite busy so you have to be okay with that. Sometimes there's a bit of noise polution from all of the people but it's definitely worth it. Also there's a lot of things to do on this beach."
Avidtravelmale,45 contributions,Oct 2016,Much preferred double six to Kuta beach. Much quieter for surfing and the same in terms of waves. Would visit here instead of Kuta main beach. 
Michael S,"Scottsdale, AZ",Oct 2016,This beach is just up the road from Kuta and it's worth the short trip to get there.  The waves are great and there are some very nice restaurants and beach clubs.  Sunset time is fantastic here and it's worth a visit.If you want to learn to surf then this is a great spot for beginners.
Betty M,"Hamburg, PA",Oct 2016,"Lovely clean beach, many places to go for lunch or just a drink. Lots of ladies will ask if you want a massage but if you politely decline they wont be pushy."
MrsADCae,34 contributions,Sep 2016,I love this beach. Very quiet and beautiful. I get an access from Haven Seminyak hotel. Free shuttle :)
lynton1,"Cape Town, South Africa",Sep 2016,This is a great beach with good surf and golden sand. All along the beach are some cool beach bars so what better than a stroll along the beach and then nipping into a bar for a beer. And if one wants to go upmarket then Ku De Ta is a short walk away
Sling24,6 contributions,Oct 2016,Sunset is ok but too much noisy and dirty and the drink prices are not reasonable. I will not come back
G N,"Berlin, Germany",Oct 2016,It is not a very good beach if you are not a surfer. You can find also lot of garbage. Just go there to see the sunset while you have a drink in any bar.No es una buena playa si no eres surfista. Encontrar√°s mucha basura. S√≥lo ve a mirar el atardecer en uno de sus muchos bares.
berlinIloveu,"Berlin, Germany",Oct 2016,"Terrible place which has nothing to do with bali, it's a party mile for low level drunk tourists. The beach itself is not more than ok, the bars and restaurants do occupy 80% of the room. Loud and extremely commercial."
Pedro de Pedra,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,"Clearer sand and beach with gentle inclination and waves, so good for swimming, kids, and starting surfers. At sunset very crowded with people lounging on colorful beach chairs and bean bags while DJ plays the tunes. Close to Seminyak centre."
Tony G,4 contributions,Oct 2016,"I love this hotel !The staff are all so warm and friendly, it feels like returning home.It's location is perfect across the road from the beach and close to shops, bars and restaurants.First class Spa and restaurants..the Plantation Grill combines a traditional 40,s style setting with great food and stylish jazz combos.The breakfast is the best in Seminyak and the hotel has a poolside bar and a spectacular rooftop bar.Younger generation will enjoy Cocoon next door..the in place for poolside musicThanks again to the wonderful staff for making my stay so specialTony GobboMelbourne"
Shelle123,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"This Hotel really is stunning & pure indulgence, but for us a little over the top. The location is 10 out of 10, the decor & environment is lustrous & if you enjoy being waited on hand & foot & pampered this hotel will not disappoint although to us it felt almost fake. The roof top bar was sensational, one of the best that we've seen, drinks were reasonable & music was just perfect, we could easily have stayed there longer. We didn't stay for dinner as there was too much waiting around & was told later by others that it was pretty average & overpriced. I also don't think that it would be very child friendly either."
Michael B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"Like most of the beaches along this strip, there are hawkers, restaurants, bars and tourist galore. The hawkers don't seem to be as persistent as back in the 80's and 90's but dont engage them unless you are prepared to buy. The best answer is ""already have one thanks"". The beachside bars and restaurants spill on to rhe sand at night with great food and live entertainment."
Asif Asif,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Sep 2016,"To be honest, at first I didn't realize about this place until I looked up on the GPS map. Hard to differentiate it from the Legian beach and the Seminyak beach."
guitarist2016,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,A must do is to enjoy the sunsets by the beach sipping something cool and taking in the beach life of this lively stretch of sand. 
Jaron F,"Narrabeen, Australia",Oct 2016,"Been to Double 6 beach several times. It's good for kids to jump in the shallows of the beach. Good for cheap eats on bean bags. Good for sunsets. Bad bits are only the local people selling their wares, but they aren't pushy so not a worry. It's also challenging to get a shower to clean the kids off afterwards if you wish to clean off before going back into the streets."
Andowhite,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,Fantastic beach with beautiful sand but if you don't like people go early as it gets packed .. you can hire chairs umbrellas etc and drinks .... beautiful scenery
Nicholas B,pennyroyal,Oct 2016,"Been coming to Bali for years and it's really going down the gurgler. Pollution is a shocker, locals rely on ocean doing the cleaning as the majority don't seem to care (some do as I have spoken to them and they seem helpless to do anything about it)and where does all that plastic go?? Definitely don't come in the wet season, creeks that run nearby are primarily drains. A shame"
Nancy A,"Perth Hills, Australia",Oct 2016,"We came here on Friday 30/09/16, the night before the AFL Grand finals.  Last year at this time there were no seats left and were told to book the seats in the water a week before.  This time seats were plentiful and there don't seem to be anyone in the bar?So we had a few bites and a drink as they don't serve dinner here.  It was quite expensive donee decided to go somewhere else for dinner."
Michael B,"Maleny, Australia",Sep 2016,Our son in law took us here again and we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the sunset. A few cold beers later and we left happily to have dinner at a nearby restaurant.Excellant way to relax and soak in the Bali lifestyle.
Sam,"Weymouth, UK",Oct 2016,"We spent most of our Seminyak days here at Rudy's bar (just along from the Seaside Mexican restaurant). Only 50,000 for 2 beds and umbrella, drinks are cheap too! The waves are big and a lot of fun in this beach. Supposably a great place to see the sunset but it keeps raining in the afternoons and is too cloudy to see the sunset so can't comment on that. Parking along the beach is 3,000 rupiah."
Martin D,"Frankfurt, Germany",Sep 2016,"Easy to get too & cheap sun lounger for the day.The local lads will watch your bag as well, for a few rupees! "
KeriBuenosAires,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2016,"DoubleSix seems to be the nicest stretch of the 14km beach, which runs from Kuta north (sorry, Seminyak). It is definitely a surf beach (which means it isn't great for actually swimming). But it does seem to be a great place to learn to surf - warm water, sand, not coral, and a constant wave. As well, as dozens of surf teachers and schools. It is also a great walking beach."
Mary l,whitsundays Aus.,Jun 2016,"Great bars, plenty of restaurants,  excellent views, beanbags on beach at bars.  Check out Double Six Rooftop bar, it is amazing. "
Dayana_Kantarevic,88 contributions,Sep 2016,Great beach with plenty of restaurants and bars.You can book a sun bed and it is pretty cheap for the entire day.Good atmosphere.
Melz Y,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"Lovely beach to have relax time and lay down for a day.. sunbath, reading a book, having beer. its really good to back and have great time like beach boys hahahha...  "
Picadores,"Frankfurt (Oder), Germany",Sep 2016,"It's like almost all beaches in south west Bali. The trash is swept by the ocean, the tourists and the locals. Therefore there's glass on the beach and plastic swimming in the ocean. Disgusting!"
Harrietzhong,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Dec 2015,This seminyak beach is very nice and not so crowded compared to kuta beach which is located very close.
Marc P,"Cologne, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",Sep 2016,"Well, 66 beach has become very popular. When you come down from Jalan Double Six to the right: There are many small beach restaurants where you can sit on the beach and enjoy live music.To the left: there you can rent sunchairs for 25.000 idr ( ca. 1,70‚Ç¨). The boys will look after your stuff when you go swimming or surfing. It has become a very popular beach so especially on weekends and evenings it becomes very crowded. The sunsets are really breathtaking.Try to enjoy a bowl of Bakso while you are there. The stand is on the beach a bit to the South of Caf√© Zanzibar. Best Bakso in Bali."
Helen2515,"Wollongong, Australia",Sep 2016,"Hired sun chairs here to relax and read.Initially got hounded by locals trying to sell their produce, and massages. Didn't take long for them to realise we didn't require anything, the icecream vendor was fantastic though. Just what we needed when we were really hot.We didn't swim in the beach, however my husband went surfing here."
yialli,"Greater London, UK",Sep 2016,"There's a few good bars on the beach here, reasonable prices (well for Seminyak, not for Bali, the whole of Seminyak and surrounding area is ridiculously expensive so these bars are the cheap end of ridiculously expensive). More at commonsensible.org"
ElizabethCHelsinki,"Nueva Andalucia, Spain",Sep 2016,Fantastic location for the sunset watch. Many lovely cafes and restaurants just by the beach so you can sit there while enjoying the sunset.These cafes get pretty crowded so be sure to be there before 6pm in order to get a place. Prices of drinks are slightly higher than cafes on the streets but worth it for the sunset view.
Kurt W,43 contributions,Aug 2016,A lot to choose from in beach food and drinks. The meatballs are great for a bit and la plancha on the bean bags for sunset is cool
beat788,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"nice partytime especially for the smaller ones up to 18 Otherwise lots of fun and games all around busy shoppint, etc. ."
Anand1351,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"We stayed in the haven hotel and walked to Double six beach which is nearby. Beach is great, darkish Sand, you can walk for miles and enjoy beautiful views. We went twice, in afternoon and another day to watch Sunset. You does not feel crowded, you can walk north upwards Seminyak or southwards towards Kuta.There is a Surfing school there and people were enjoying taking lessons and trying as waves are high.Not suitable for Swimming as currents are strong there. Sand there is so soft that you can walk for miles comfortably."
Simon P,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2016,"Lovely sandy beach. The waves are perfect for surfing, but there are strong currents so not ideal for swimming. The beach was a bit crowded with games of football at times, but the beer was cheap!"
AlexGUK94,"Hartford, UK",Sep 2016,This is a nice beach. It is lined with many little bars and surf shops that create a nice atmosphere to relax on and the water is great for learning to surf. I would recommend Santai surf as they were fantastic.   
Shamroze Z,9 contributions,Sep 2016,"This beach is filled with surfers and there are lots of instructors around as well. So if you ever wanted to try this sport, double six is the place to go! "
June H,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"My name is George Hondris and my wife June recently went to this Luxurious Hotel to once again enjoy their hospitality and food.As we suspected we were not disappointed service & food was excellent. Unfortunately I picked up a stomach bug FROM MY PREVIOUS DESTINATION  which precluded me from eating. Once the Managing Director ascertained about my ailment, he personally arranged for a pot of Ginger Tea to be delivered to my room.  I tried the drink with treportatiion and was surprised to find that it was very pleasant. What a lovely guesture from a very very busy man.He made several attempts to communicate with me during the time of our stay unfortunately i was out of action. "
Mike P,"Innsbruck, Austria",Sep 2016,"Great swimming and surfing beach, dangerous currents (swim between the flags. Lots Pollution and small beach bars."
TanFerry,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach is a must go if you are coming to bali! Lots of activities going on here with some nice food stalls for you to enjoy. Best time to come is sunset, friends with me really enjoyed the local food stalls and beers while watching the beautiful sunset!"
ManagerNest,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Nice beach up from Kuta , not so busy  Could get chairs and beer easily, Good coffee just behind us in The Book Cafe. Relaxing not hassled!!"
zpclan,"Quebec City, Canada",Sep 2016,"Nice clean beach, lot of people and warung, big waves, nice spot to learn surf. Nice sand. Easy access and free"
Pumperman,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"I thought this would not be my cup of tea, but I came to love taking a walk down to the busy beach, grabbing a bean bag seat and sinking a few $2 bintang's whilst listening to tunes.There a plenty of guys with chilly bins to chose from, with the prices the same across the board.The only irritation is the constant hawkers selling their fake goods at ramped up prices."
Neil F,"Invercargill, New Zealand",Sep 2016,Expansive beach with a nice surf swell. Water temperature is better than our air temp back home in the summer time!
redhat eileen b,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,Good long stretch of beach for a walk. Several temporary beach bars with young men wanting to sell you a beer. Local dogs play in the surf and surfers make the most of the waves. Not my ideal location but pleasant
Bernard ≈†,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,Nice place to watch a sunset. You'd have to go early to get the best seats otherwise you'll be shoulder surfing for sunset views. For me getting cocktails that tasted like mocktails were a turn off especially when paying aussie prices. I couldn't be bothered arguing that night so didn't bother telling them and we just left after our drinks.
GrikAsianNomad,"Da Nang, Vietnam",Feb 2016,"lots of bean bag style chairs grouped together into informal beach bars with soft drinks and beer.  food is not always for sure, depends on who shows up cooking which dishes around your spot.  but for sure it's the most relaxing and pleasant beaches in the area."
kimberly B,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2016,The beach is wide and lined with hotels with water view restaurants. Lots of people come to watch the sunsets. Have dinner at one of the beach restaurants like La Lucciola or Breezes.
Mats H,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2016,"I absolutely love this beach and it's busy from sunrise until midnight. Take a walk in the morning, do some surfing later in the day and end with drinks and dinner with live music. Think my wife took 500 photos of the sunset. "
Thales B,3 contributions,Sep 2016,Party beach with lots of restaurants and bars. Good to chill out with friends having a white wine and beers at the sunset!
Jen S,"Daegu, South Korea",Sep 2016,"Free clean beach, and in my opinion the beast beach, in southern Bali.  A great place to walk along the beach, rent a lounge chair for the day (70,000 to 100,000 rupiah) and read a book, or put your toes in the ocean. Also no free toilets, you have to pay 5000 rupiah to use one. Not the best beach for swimming but very good waves if you are a surfer. The restaurants along here are overpriced and not that great food wise, but if you travel inward a bit from the beach there are tons of local joints you can get amazing food at a steal."
Sue H,"Sydney Olympic Park, Australia",Aug 2016,"Great beach and atmosphere. Lots of people, restaurants,shopping and swimming. Always something happening or just sit back and watch the passers by. Great swimming beach"
William O,"Algarvia, Portugal",Sep 2016,This beach just shows how we can ruin a great place! Don't look here for the reputed silver sands of Bali!
suzanne1207,"Bendigo, Australia",Sep 2016,We stayed at the double six with another couple. The staff are beyond compare the facilities also. We had an issue with noise as we are early risers and early to bed. The venues directly across the road were a problem ... I have been assured by management they are in the process of replacing windows with double glazed Windows which will elevate those concernsThe food in the Italian restaraunt was superb and again so were the staffNothing is a problem the rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms were probably the best I've come across on AsiaIf we go back to Bali without hesitation we will definitely stay at double six again
Blossom S,"Arzignano, Italy",Sep 2016,"Many thing you can do in this beach, from walking in the morning, surfing in the afternoon until you can see the beautiful sunset in the evening. After sunset you still can enjoy the live band and enjoy the dinner. So awesome!!!"
Lucky7Traveler,"Santa Barbara, CA",Sep 2016,"The beaches and ocean in Bali are really made for strong swimmers. There tends to be some heavy rip tides and strong currents. I would advise anyone wanting to go in the water to be careful if they are weak swimmers. Yes, there are lifeguards, but don't put yourself in a risky position. With that said, this is a wonderfully fun beach and I must have been out in the water for 4 hours one day just jumping in and out of waves! So much fun!"
CKBliss,"Rockingham, Australia",Sep 2016,"Great beach for a swim, or just a walk, or even just to sit around and have a meal and/or drinks. So much goes on down here and if you're looking for a place to eat, there's many places to choose from. "
Floriano B,"Bari, Italy",Sep 2016,we had an amazing time especially after 6 pm coz the sun is going down and cover bands start to play a nice music you can enjoy by having a drink.
Maree68,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"I don't have any other beach to compare this too, but coming from the Gold Coast, I do know a good beach when I'm on one, and this was a very nice beach.  One day the waves were big, and the next day not as large, but still enjoyed by families galore.  You do have people selling their wares on this beach, but I imagine you are going to have that on every beach, and they were all very respective with big smiles.  There are restaurants all the way along the beach for you to choose from when you need a break from swimming or sunbaking :D"
Yuliana Y,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Clean water, Nice view, and nice Meat ball soup stall called ""Bakso Gerobak Biru"" which open at 2pm in certain days only. "
StefanBlezynski,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,I just wanted to go for a quick swim and see what this beach was like. The minute you step on the beach you are swarmed by locals asking you to pay 100k to rent a seat and umbrella for 1 hour! So we decided to sit on the sand but were given dirty looks by the locals. The beach had quite a bit of rubbish. The  water was warm and nice however.
Gillian W,Perth,Jul 2016,We met friends here for a pre dinner drink and to watch the sunset - perfect venue for this and the service was terrific too!
Martin W,"Gravesend, UK",Sep 2016,"Plenty of beds. Surfing available, lots of beach bars and restaurants nearby. Cashpoint machines at at bottom of Jl Arjuna. Nice breakfast at the Trattoria "
ChrisRooboy1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,We would walk beach everyday from Seminyak to Legion and found Double six beach a great stop for a cold drink. You can also enjoy the sunset on a bean bag with a cocktail or cold beer. Hawkers don't harass but still come past and ask the question. Also good massage available when required but check for cleanliness.
JandH201403,United Kingdom,Jul 2016,"We stayed athe the DOUBLESIX HOTEL for part of our honeymoon, and this beach was stunning. We spent time there every sunset. "
McManwein,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,"Was very surprised to find that the beach and environment has been cleaned up recently, it used to be really dirty and hawkers would constantly hassle you but on this visit I found that people were left alone to enjoy it and couldn't believe the transformation, it was beautiful.  We even saw a marching band one night.  "
taga09,4 contributions,Jul 2016,great bintangs on the beach and friendly singalongs. Nothing is ever to hard always willing to help with a sun lounge and umbrella.
Tetty S,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Very recomended for sunset time in Bali,Very comfort beach with nice place and best beach ever, feeling more calm to enjoy your drinks and food while sunset.A live music with a good entertaining complete your day.A must have to visited place in Bali for all..Awesome place that ever me with lil sis and friends visited.our last visited 21st August 2016 and will miss the moment"
calmci,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"The hot weather makes the beach a must, but it can be busy, and dirty at times. Still worth a visit for sure."
Ultimatejetsetter,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,This hotel has absolutely beautiful rooms & a gorgeous roof top bar which is amazing!There are sun bed  issues though & can be quite frustrating on a daily basis.Staff are polite & friendly.Location is good.
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,This Beach is connected with seminyak beach. there are a lot of seaside restaurant in this beach. the sand is soft so it was perfect for sport activity. but be careful for swimming as the wave is quite strong and i didnt see any lifeguard around.
Manjusha P,22 contributions,Aug 2016,This beach is after the double 6 market. Lots of people. A nice restaurant/cafe which provide bean bags to sit on the beach if you buy drinks. Lots of vendors too. They also had English Pop music playing from loud speakers. Great atmosphere.
1000Mike,"Seattle, WA",Aug 2016,"Go to the beach end of Jalan (street) Arjuna.  Turn left, and you are in the daytime area.  Many nice restaurants on the left, and the beach on the right.  On the beach is one vendor after another selling beer and soft drinks.  Free chairs if you order.  Loungers usually cost extra.  The beach pretty much closes down after sunset, although the restaurants stay open.  Go to the right, and you are in the night area.  The crowds arrive at sunset. Each beach side restaurant has lights and live bands on the beach.  Sit in your bean bag chair, listen the the live band,  and order food, beer or cocktails.  "
Janene D,"Mornington, Australia",Aug 2016,"Had a great night at the bean bag restaurants, heaps of restaurants, music and sellers of merchandise e.g. sarongs, bracelets, toys, paintings etc etc.  very cheap prices"
clivehaddow,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2016,Double Six is a fun beach - no frills but nice.Bintang costs around $2.50 per beer small and plenty of options.Loungers are plentiful and cost around $10 for lounger and umbrella.Spent many hours on this beach. Hire surf boards for $10 per hour.CLIVE
Jodi lee T,12 contributions,Aug 2016,"So glad we booked Double Six - Excellence in every way.Luxury rooms with 10/10 service day and night with your own butler service too! Loved the week we spent here very memorable for our Anniversary time and defiantly will recommend for anyone to come stay here. So relaxing,  such delicious food and the most helpful and friendly staff I have ever met- well done Double Six."
PeteW,"Cannon Creek, Australia",Aug 2016,"The beach was close to our villa so we walked here most mornings, there is a drain flowing out near the end of Double Six street which we weren't to keen on walking through so this limited the walk a little but once you are out near the breaking waves it isn't an issue. There is plenty of restaurants for breakfast on the beach too."
KayeGie,38 contributions,Jun 2016,"In a place like Bali where it is so busy, it is hard to locate something like this on the beach. However, they have The Pullman Hotel directly behind them as an easy landmark! This surfing school & it's community of people are so caring & genuine. Enjoying every moment of my family developing their skills, also bringing them food on the beach. I had a lovely foot massage by a sensitive sensible lady who knew exactly how to do it, not rough & ready like some."
barryjap,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"While we're sitting in one of the numerous beach cafes, my ears had to suffer through the cacophony of noises coming out from the speakers of every other cafes in the surrounding areas. Definitely not my kind of scene."
rayholiday2016,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,The Double Six Hotel is one of the most outstanding hotels along Double Six Beach. Check out the stunning roof top bar
pashton2016,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,The venue is amazing. The view spectacular. The service wonderful but the snacks were extremely disappointing.To sit in the sunken seats on the roof top bar was spectacular. You have to spend A$100 which is not too hard however when you go to a 6 star venue you expect quality. The daiquiris came out of a slushy machine and the tapas type food was flavorless and of a poor quality (which we left). The wine was very well priced as were the beers.In saying that it is definitely worth drinking there even if only for the view
hanakaa2016,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2016,Always a great place to eat with a wide range to choose from.  This restaurant is located next to Niksoma Hotel right on the beach
Jose G,"Valencian Country, Spain",Aug 2016,"Really not much here, sits at the mouth of a water runoff river, smelly. At least it was quiet. Sometimes quiet is good in Bali."
chris-bailey-sydney,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple. On this occasion, there are a few kids or all ages, but mostly coupes and small groups of men and women is their early 30's. It's quiet, classy and relaxed with EVERYTHING you could ever want at your fingertips.  10/10 for Double Six.  Chris and Kev "
Joe B,"Waterford, Ireland",Aug 2016,This was a great place to stop by for an evening drink but I did think it was a bit expensive but I would still return as the location and ambience of the place was great
talavalino,Philippines,Aug 2016,"Great for beginner surfers, amazing sunset but crowded. Not for people looking for a peaceful quiet place. Amazing sunset. Stayed at La plancha bar"
Aussie073,"Kensington, Australia",Jun 2016,"Great atmosphere, dinner and drink service with toes in the sand and live music every night. Bothered a bit by sellers with their goods, but that Bali and adds to the charm."
Sean d,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"When you just want to relax, your still approached for either games on the beach or hires (surfboards etc)"
GrantRobyn,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Jul 2016,"My husband & I recently stayed at this hotel. It was pure luxury! The room was fantastic, view beautiful & extremely clean. The best thing about this hotel was the staff. They were exceptional! Can't recommend this hotel enough. "
beegee165,"Tallahassee, FL",Aug 2016,Didnt' really care for this beach. Water had a lot of trash floating in it. Bad Rip current. Be careful with little ones. I held on to my daughter's life vest as the waves came in and almost dragged us back out. Cant really swim there. Get some loungers and an umbrella and enjoy some Bintangs!
Worldtravelernikceno,New York,Aug 2016,At least here you can still have a subbed for 20.000 rupiah. The waves are nice and the restaurants as well. My favorite
AmyM440NZ,"Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2016,A must do. Beer and food is reasonably priced. Watch out for the people trying to sell you stuff on the beach when you're sitting in your bean bag... found it easiest to so no thank you politely then not say anymore. And don't forget your insect repellant. A wonderful evening and a trip highlight ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
wonderingtraveller80,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2016,"this is nice beach, busy and relaxing, great to be here during sunset, because you get a great views and you can relax at the number bars, while sitting on the bean bags. There is always live music during the evening"
Kungandhi,Delhi,Jun 2016,Good beach to get relax and activities are also there. very nice weather and enjoying beach with family. 
boydie109,Newplmouth Newzealand,Aug 2016,"Stunning view early evening drinks and nibbles great service ,great if you have a group with sunken seating surrounded in water looking out over the beach."
ange827,27 contributions,Aug 2016,We always stay along this area. The shops have so much variety & the quality is great.The beach area we love especially the bean bag bars with their live music each night. There are some great restaurants hidden up the street a little from the beach that are far better prices & the food is more authentic Balinese. 
rebeccajones68,South America,Jan 2016,we are been Double six beach is nice place for relaxing because good view of the sea at winner season .  
piku1980,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable."
dennisp859,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2016,A walk along the beach is one of the pleasures of a Bali visit.Double Six Beach is fronted by Luxury Hotels right to the beach.Dozens of AirAsia umbrellas line the beach along with  beach chairs all of which have a price on them if you wish to spend time.The hawkers are there but not too bad.Always a highlight during a visit.
Casandra M,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"Where at the beach, the wave almost impossible to swim  and its happen with nature, no human can control it. Do not complaint"
DCKB,"Murten, Switzerland",Aug 2016,My kids had a blast practicing surfing in double six - and when you are hungry you can just get around and grab a pizza or pasta.
Mae G,3 contributions,Jul 2016,The sand was beautiful but very unhappy about being hassled about paying for seats and umbrellas. Also being overcharged for beer.
Verina Smith,"London, UK",Aug 2016,Have a lot of small cafe by the beach. So you can sit and drinks while waiting the sunset. They provide sun chairs aswell. There is one place with famous Bakso. One portion only 15k. The quie is quite long but the server areound can assist to get it for you. Nice taste aswell.
DWgoldengrove,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2016," I like this area some good restaurants along beach at night , love cocoon for a drink. Easy access as cars not allowed through at night. Nice walk after dinner."
DDej,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Not to be missed a definate stand out in Seminyak, sipping  cocktails in a pod spectacular ocean views "
iamparthj,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2016,"We loved this beach, they have small shacks with live music and beautiful sunset, loved being here, should definately visit for a drink, sunset and music combo."
Bernd E,"Graz, Austria",Aug 2016,We like this beach because it's not so crowded and much cleaner than the others.The beach is also more flat and therefore better for young children. Even at high waves it's safe to swim as they break further offshore.Beach offers restrooms for a small charge (IDR 3000).
markhuse87,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2016,"Cheap drinks, great place to go in the evening and sit and drink whilst watching the sun set. Drink in the bars on the beach not off the road. Much cheaper and better views! "
James B,2 contributions,Jun 2016,I have been to this place many times and never get bored with the venue.This is the best spot for relax and watch the sunset.
Csna70,26 contributions,Jul 2016,Lovely beach and sand. Always packed with people. You can play around the beach at day time and sun bathing then moved to bean bags at 5PM.
Adr1an100,"Fremantle, Australia",Aug 2016,We went to the roof top bar. Absoloutly best view in Bali.Spoilt by expensive watery lolly water drinks. Will never go there again. Great spot for people with too much money and no taste!!
Bernard Budi S,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Last week i was here, i run with my friends through this beach... not very clean i think.. the waves was good at that time.. thats why a lot of people were surfing. The best time to go to this beach is at the evening ylu can see a beautiful sunset here.. lots of rooftop bar at here so you can easily pick one"
Anita W,8 contributions,Aug 2016,"Lovely sandy beach, easy to rent loungers. I love watching the surfers, and my teenage daughter was impressed enough by all happening around. "
Vikrant0308,"Amritsar, India",Jul 2016,"This is near W hotel, which I found it to be very calm as compared to other beaches in bali, it was fun here to sepnd time drinking beer and having Corns. "
Ian S,"Berri, Australia",Jun 2016,Nice for a walk along and past all the restaurants next to the beach - the ones on the beach and the ones on the other side of the road are a little on the expensive side - but the view is good.
Mark S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"If your into the surf, sea & sand this is a good spot. If you just want to relax on one the beach chairs under the umbrella and watch all around you this is also a good spot.You do get locals wanting to sell you the usual but they are not over the top nor persistent and you can get some good bargains!"
Michelle L,Auckland,Jul 2016,"Our hotel had a private spot at Double Six Beach, we pay the guys 150k for 2 lounge chairs for 5 hours (outside of hotel's territory). it was nice as it's right in front of the beach, with not many people around."
deejay1948,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Busy beach but plenty of sun lounges to hire....negotiate...they ask for 100,000 but walk away if they won,t take 50,000.Remember,you are renting it,not buying it.Try to swim in the flagged area but don,t expect Bondi Rescue life guards.Be aware..there is often a strong undertow.Bali beaches can be very dangereous."
Gary D,"Austin, TX",Jul 2016,"During my 3 week stay in Bali, the Double Six Beach was my favorite hang-out!  Besides being beautiful (and filled with beautiful people!), the cafe's shops and staff were outstanding!  A true, Bali gem of a beach!"
Sarah H,15 contributions,Jul 2016,"Lots of bars with live music and comfy beanbags on the sand, great to chill out after dinner and have a drink"
hwangpauline,"Ottawa, Canada",Jul 2016,We passed by at night so couldn't really appreciate the beach and its beauty (if any). I'd give this a pass for other beaches though.
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,"Double 6 is one of the nicest beaches on Bali. It is very big and stretches from Kuta upto Seminyak. Double 6 is perfctly located in the middle and has some great waves for surfing and some nice beachbars and restaurants.Mind you prices are relatively high, specially in the busy seasons"
girleen,"Portland, OR",Jun 2016,"Our go to beach in Seminyak. We've been learning to surf here. The waves are fast so it's hard work, but it's fun to try. Great casual bars and beach restaurants. Nice place to chill."
Geoff M,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",May 2016,"This review relates to day time visits, not night time:Once you get past the filthy street and open drains, I found a surprisingly pleasant experience. The beach was clean, street vendors - yes, but not too many and not too pushy, nice drinking and eating. An all round good relaxing experience, which saw me return a few times. Enjoyed sitting in the bars, by myself, having a beer and pondering life.I did not however, go swimming here, so cannot comment on the quality of the water."
martianoairlangga,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Wonderful beach. A great place for sunbathing, umbrella, dogs, swim, and usually some local plays beach football with other tourists also.. what a nice view"
MariaWells,"Nowra, Australia",Apr 2016,"The beach quite busy (was not like Kuta beach), lots of cafe, beautiful sunset, we love to walk from double six to Legian beach.."
helenmcd,Australia,Jul 2016,"Rubbish everywhere, the beachside bar where we stopped for a drink was filthy and overpriced. Smoking was allowed inside/undercover as well. The tatty beach chairs were unappealing, unless you were settling down to a day drinking beer I guess."
Tonymaddogsurfer,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,less people annoying you to buy stuff than kuta! good for sunset too. la plancha is good for dinner and a drink 
Chris B,"Miranda, Australia",Jul 2016,"Very popular beach. You can enjoy your drink under the beach umbrellas, listen to western style music, surf, swim or simply walk around."
eakalev,"Tallinn, Estonia",Jul 2016,If you like waves and surfing and sun taking this is place for you.In the beach many restaurants and in the evening was beach very nice.
Alex G,3 contributions,Jun 2016,"This place is 100% FANTASTIC the staff were amazing, Juni from the Breezes hotel resort (sister resort) got us a few nights here. We loved it! The breakfast buffet was ALL TIME!"
Jean & John C,"Monasteraden, Ireland",Jul 2016,Nice beach with lots of facilities and good cafes and restaurants close by.   Spend the whole day here and you wont regret it.  Perfect for everyone.
Em-n-Bee,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2016,"Went for a walk along the beach in the morning, smelt bad from a storm / waste water run-out and there was rubbish everywhere!"
Lydia H,4 contributions,Jul 2016,"idk why people said that this beach is the best beach... for me, this beach so dirty and i prefer kuta beach than this beach. My suggestion : you should try Padang Padang Beach at Uluwatu. "
Guy W,"Greensborough, Australia",Jul 2016,heaps of food choices and places to drink.  From warungs to large hotel bars.  A choice of foods and loads of cold beers.  The ladies give good foot massages and are always up for a good chat and laugh.
NoakhaillaBHOOT,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2016,"Its THE best beach in Bali to spend the day with your family and friends. Its not crazy crowed like Kuta or Legian Beach. Also for me, the crowd here seemed a bit better in terms of ""class"" (sorry for being politically incorrect) ... but its true!!! Kuta and Legian beaches are like fish markets compared to this one. The Double6 beach is much much cleaner and the restaurants on the beach are quite nice, nothing great but just nice. You can rent seats/umbrella for USD 20 for the whole day, surf boards are USD 7.5, body boards are USD 4 !!! There are beer guys right at the beach, they serve really chilled beers and drinks (with nuts) right to you on the sand. Its awesome. But the best part was the water, it was warm to perfection. We simply loved our time at the Double6 beach. I highly recommend this one. Why I don't like the other beaches: 1. Nusa Dua : Nice and clean, but they are mostly Shell Beaches, not comfortable for going for a swim. The waves are quite calm as well. 2. Kuta & Legian : Too crowed and a bit dirty."
Darren O,22 contributions,Jul 2016,Surf lessons available nice beach sand slight grey colour but beautiful swell does vary.    Calm yesterday 6 foot today but that's the biggest in our seven days.  Kids no problem.    3-yrs with hand held of adult near buy would be safe
AileenSy_1984,108 contributions,Feb 2016,"Double6 is a seasoned spot for sundown drinks and it is amazing for that. The scene is set and adjusted to lure unsuspecting tourists to sit by these colourful beanbags like fly to a trap. The bands that play live music is a good touch, they start somewhere around 7-10 pm on weekends. Not sure on weekdays. Throughout the afternoon however, you will be asked 20 times by random people selling a range of random items, from bouncy glowing balls, to massage, to hair braiding, surf lessons, pirate boat shaped kites, machetes, the list goes on. Next time, i will video and put together a clip, lol!Anywho, the waters during the months of Sept -Nov are sort of dirty, with floating bags and beer cans. It doesn't sweep in the shore and stays by the break. It is quite visible on a non wavey day. There are plenty of little shops where you can but beer (IDR20k) for or snacks that they can bring to your rented sun lounges for IDR 50k (if you can haggle like a Chinese would :D Thanks mom!) to IDR 150k. Overall an ok experience, but not something I want to do again, or reminisce on. "
EllaGD,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nice to walk along around  5 in the afternoon a few bean bag bars which are lovely, take a sarong to sit on as the bean bags are a bit grubby!"
kathNelsonNewZealand,nelson new zealand,Jul 2016,Comfy bean bags to sit on .Live music every night. Drinks all  varieties. Food a bit on the fry side but great if you have had too many Bintangs..
Teguh P,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"A beautiful sunset and nice beach bar. the sand, the wave, and the drink are very pleasant.an ice cold beer and a comfortable bean bag are great couples to spending time in here"
YHN-ID,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"sand is smooth , there are people who can rent us Horse to go around the beach , a lot cafe to get drink , there are also life guard standby so feel safe to swim.  and you can see beautiful sunset if you lucky :)"
Sultan A,6 contributions,Jul 2016,The beach smells bad like sewerage I don't like  the dirt and smell but the view is something else. I loved the view but without smell
Steven J,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,What an awesome way to finish off a great day in Bali. Ice cold Bintangs and cocktails on comfortable bean bags with local cover bands playing and lanterns being launched. Beautiful atmosphere.
Phathj75,97 contributions,Jul 2016,"Double six beach is always a destination for my Wife and I, We love to arrive around 545pm, Just before the crowds roll in, Find a prime seat in one of the many beach bars, Order a cold beer and a snack and watch the Sunset roll across the countryside, For about an hr you forget the world exists.You will get approached by the beach sellers, but they are polite and prompt to dispatch.there is no sunset if it has been raining, but the experience is great none the less."
Annaliese L,"Newlands, South Africa",Jul 2016,"We loved this beach, it was great for a day time tan and swim as long as you do not mind the traders that hassle you every 5 minutes. Also a wonderful place to watch the sunset and have a cocktail...............or even dance on the beach with live music."
Flyholiday50,"Fethiye, Turkey",Jul 2016,Busy beach. Lots of surfers. Sunbeds moved down the beach as tide goes out. Bit confusing when we came back from lunch. Paid 50k idr each for a bed 
mikasinaga,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"I came to this place over and over again!Nice view, good environment, there are a lot of restaurants and warung, etc.White sand, you can see the surfer ..But more than all, this place is the best to see the sunsets!"
Alexandre S,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2016,Nice beach with enough waves for surfers. Quite packed with tourist on the beach but no much crowd in water.  Amazing scenery from as there nothing expect of the sea at the horizon
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"A truly beautiful beach. Clean, nice sand and great waves. Stunning at sunset where loads of happy people gather and enjoy a drink, food, traders, everything's peaceful. Kids playing laughing running, a real happy place to be. Great selection of food places to eat."
Ben W,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2016,"Stinks, pretty dirty beach. Struggled to justify the $10 for the lounges on the beach, but it was worth it to get the food and drink service. There is an open sewer very near where we were going straight in the ocean. Like most beaches in Bali, they just can't compare with what we have in Australia. "
fiona d,"Sidney, Canada",Jul 2016,"the view is great and easy for commuters, try their restaurant especially Sate Bali restaurant in Kayu aya village, the food was amazing and they have JOGLO view and wooden concept which is great and pretty"
svetick777,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2016,"Beautiful Beach with nice beach restaurants with comfortablesoft chairs, nice views, relaxing....I loved being there."
Swindon_Boy,Swindon_Boy,Jun 2016,"Great beach for sundowner drinks. Find one of the numerous bars on the beach, pull up a chair, bean bag or sun lounger and watch the sunset while having a few Bintangs. Plenty of resyaurants nearby for a meal once the sun has set."
Ulrich S,"Thun, Bern, Switzerland",Jun 2016,There are a lot of chairs. At the beach you can get food and drinks. Quite a lot of people always there.
Ivette C,"Chicago, IL",May 2016,"I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott and the hotel has a little spot right in front of the Double Six Beach hotel for its guests. Unfortunately, the beach was very dirty. Not the ideal paradise when you think of Bali, but it was a decent beach to run in the morning and to look at the surfers, bargain with different vendors and relax. "
sarah H,Indonesia,Jul 2016,Love this beach starting from legian walking the beach to seminyak is simply stunning. A lot of dog walkers early in the morning & a fair bit of rubbish past the private villas but it was being cleaned but still not nice to see. Over all still a beautiful beach
F4745GValexc,8 contributions,Jul 2016,Do not come here with children unless you are here to party it's noise after noise. The music on the beach goes on until midnight every night. Very loud techno and karaoke not a nice tranquil holiday we imagined Bali to be. Very disappointed with this tacky style holiday
Susan P,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,"Beautiful rooms, comfy bed, great pool, unbelievable rooftop bar, would return to this hotel anytime."
ThompsonBuggins,"Bushmills, UK",Jul 2015,We got to try out a few different beaches. We preferred Seminyak Beach as it was calmer and less people for us as a family. Double Six Beach is probably best for surfers and those who want to socialise with others. It's got lots of bars on the beach so noisier than Seminyak Beach. 
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,"Relatively  clean beach by Bali standards. Lots of food outlets, with various types of  bean bags on the beach. An interesting place to have an evening meal and watch the sunset. You will need to find a sweet spot between the many music groups and Djs all playing very close to each other. This beach does have hawkers selling various items, but not as pushy as in Kuta. If you are in one of the beach side food outlets they tend to leave you alone. Beware as the tide comes in it will reach some of the bean bag restaurants."
Gary_Bagus,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"Good surf and beach facilities, plenty restaurants and bars Cocoon Day bar on beach and a rocking place."
jcarnell2016,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2016,"This beach is very touristy and the busy areas in front of the hotels is a hawker's paradise, hassling you constantly for what ever you want or need, but further up the beach it is nicer, and less polluted, not sure if I would swim there! Bali has very different laws regulating sewerage treatment (or lack of treatment), just an observation IMO, there are many much more beautiful places to swim in Bali, pick one."
alliglenn,Melbourne,Jun 2016,"I spent a gorgeous (hot) day walking the beach from Seminyak to Legian while my travel buddies shopped - one day of shopping is all I need in Bali :) During this walk I stopped at locations on the way to have a drink and a swim which was ok at each place except Double 6. I was going to have lunch there as well but was told the pool was only for guests (this may be the norm in many countries but in Bali it was quite unusual). There were many people around the pool but no-one in it! I decided to take my money next door to Cacoon and had a lovely swim, some tapas and a delicious cocktail. Probably wouldn't go back there with so many other options in Bali."
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Colorful, that was the impression when first time visit there. Everybody cheers up waiting for sunset. At that time, the beach was good for learn to surfing. Not only adults, kids were here and there running in the water and some played with sands. Very nice place to enjoy. More crowded people came, when the clock closed to 6pm. No ticket fee to access, only parking if we carry vehicles. And several music stage were ready to complete your time."
PY L,9 contributions,Jun 2016,Went there one morning to take a stroll along the beach and enjoy the waves but was approached by the surf schools and other sales people almost every minute. Plug into your ear phones to block out their constant callings.
Sendy R,Indonesia,Jun 2016,This beach is cleaner than kuta beach. They are a lot of cafe with beanbag. A nice place to wait the sunset. Kiddos love to spend time here. 
janice0311,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"Always love to come here to enjoy the sunset, white sand and the beach really clean. I love Double Six Beach"
Stephanie B,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,Go to K Resto and sit in a beanbag and watch the sunset. The food is great. We had spring rolls and other dishes from their Asean menu. Wonderful food and lovely view.
MeeshellB,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,Beautiful spot to sit for sunset drinks. Restaurant and bar area. Comfortable bean bags at some of the restaurant. Relaxed atmosphere. Food is ok. Not fabulous But inexpensive. Good atmosphere. Worth a casual drink in the evening. You will enjoy it. 
kerstin_schweiz,"Zug, Switzerland",Apr 2016,"Very nice and wide beach incl. a wonderful sunset. Nice little and bigger restaurant or bars along the beach. Depends were you are at the beach, there more or less seller. If you like to make a surf course, not problem do it here!"
smilingtravelbug,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Not too rough.  Clean.  Great beach bars to enjoy after a dip :)  A fantastic location on the border of Seminyak and Legian.
DanielEdinburgh34,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Unfortunately this beach not appealing at all. Perhaps I came to the wrong part of Bali! Sunbeds as far as the eye can see with very little space left for an area to lie on with a towel. 
yogibikini,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",May 2016,"Since 2002 I always love this beach. For me , it does not matter if its plenty of people or not so many tourist. I can get relax and chill out easily with the lager depot not so far and Indonesian famous meat balls 20 steps away. Of course some vendors come promoting their things, but I guess it's their job and just ignore politely if you are not interested."
Ang4lia,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Very nice beach, nice view as well, and can not wait to see the sunset everyday from this beach. Highly reccomended"
Lydia R,207 contributions,Jun 2016,"Double Six Beach is a favourite of mine in Bali, not for the swimming though, it's more about the beach bars and people watching. It has a really great atmosphere and plenty of choice if you're looking for a lunch venue or place to chill out for an arvo session."
BrightSide101,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"This beach with all its bean bags and bars is a treat. A joy during the day and even more wonderful at dusk.Drinks, great food, beach sellers,and the waves lapping at your feet ( as long as you avoid the king tides)"
Janet L,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"As with all things Bali the staff were very accomodating and we were only visitors! My daughter and here young family were here for a week and had a lovely time.Despite the fact that the place was less than two years old, it could look a bit shabby in another year! There was rust and sticking doors, the Bintang was $6.50 in the room bar, so watch out for being fleeced! A good area for shopping and the pool is very nice."
Ausie1944,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,Patrolled beach that is very safe. Double Six has beach chairs for guests with service from the hotel
Neatesy,193 contributions,Jun 2016,"This beach sits at the end of a drain that runs directectly into the ocean..at times it can be very smelly and you really don't want to step in it let alone walk through it...they have now put up a little bridge to help with that but that rancid water runs straight into the ocean and where you swim...it's also very commercialised so loads of vendors asking you if you need a massage, sunglasses, sarong, jewlery etc.."
nickyp888,7 contributions,Jun 2016,Good place to rent surfboards and learn how to surf! The beach is also close to a few nice restaurants and bars that have beanbags and an awesome vibe. Central and easy to find. Bit smelly though!
hrishi2016,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",May 2016,"I visited Double Six Beach on recommendation of our hotel's travel desk. The beach is nothing too great, there are several other beaches much better than Double Six Beach in Bali. I would recommend Semiyank Beach for sunset which is much cleaner."
Pat K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Went down to grab a board and have a go at surfing. Easy to grab a board and rash vest. Plenty of people learning to surf but wasn't overly crowded. Beach isn't the cleanest ever but plenty of room. 
ashwinsingh2908,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"We only enjoyed the beach in the evenings. The seas were rough during our time as well. However to some degree, i frequent bondi beach and in my view this beach could not be compared. The sand isn't as good or golden however awesome to sit have few beers, enjoy live music and relax in the evening.  "
minah,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"good for children to play sand, running, we can't sit in a chair that pay 100 thousand rupiah within one or two hours , lovit "
miafalatehan,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"One of our favorite beach to walk and admire the sunset. We often take a slow walk from Petitenget Beach to Double Six Beach, the view was worth every step, didn't even get tired or bored. It was an amazing experience."
Wayne L,"Geelong, Australia",Jun 2016,"Come down here for sunsets and drinks before dinnerrelaxed atmosphere and great to people watch,Bean bags on beach"
nimms79,2 contributions,Jun 2016,Was an awesome experience having dinner by the beach with live band. Food n ambience was fantastic! They even offered a free ice cream sundae for my friend's bday celebration. Awesome! Memorable experience!
androidappleos,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Jun 2016,This beach is very peculiar. The sand is blackish brown and super fine. You dont feel the grain of sands rubbing between your toes. It is almost like powder and on top of all this. There are no stones. Imagine that!  The roaring waves are a sight to see and they can be dangerous for kids. Just need to be careful and watch out for riptides.  During the high tide the waves actually reaches the stone walls and sometimes splashing against the side of the pubs.
Chad M,perth,Jun 2016,This place is buzzing from about 5pm onwards. All the small bars bring out bean bags onto the beach and serve food and drinks while you watch the sunset. There is music from live bands and DJ's. Definitely a must do at sunset while in Bali. 
Mandi H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jun 2016,"Highly over rated. Dirty beach, very ordinary cafe's / restaurants. Not worth the time. Glad we were not staying at one of the beach front hotels. If you want a clean beach go to Jimbaran or Nusa Dua. Even Legian was cleaner than this."
Jacqueline M,79 contributions,Jun 2016,"This beach is crowded and unfortunately dirty. There's lots of litter and there was a certain smell I can't put my finger on. There were many beach vendors as well. The good thing about it is the many bars along the beach. If you prefer somewhere quieter and cleaner, I would suggest Seminyak beach, it's just a short distance away."
Gajadama,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Very big waves, so have to be a bit careful but plenty life guards around. Rented two chairs with really nice cushion and umbrella for only IDR 50,000 (for the two). Ordered a cold drink and had a great afternoon!Beach does get crowded two hours before sunset but I kind of liked the buzz after a lazy afternoon."
kletica,"Perth Hills, Australia",Jul 2015,"Stayed here last year and we are staying again this year for a couple of weeks. Great location, great food, our room was more if a suite and was beautiful and had a spectacular view over the ocean with a huge balcony. Close to lots of great Warungs and restaurants. Friendly staff"
xshaun3,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,We spent a sunset and a morning on the beach - we think better than Kuta and Legian as not as busy.  Good to hire a board and have a surf.
Fon,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2016,The best place to enjoy sunset in Bali. Enjoying the beach because it was not crowded . A good place to relax 
Rowan M,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Well it a good place as long as you dont go 1st thing in the morning as every morning thay need to clean the rubbish of the beach that wash up over night it ok but  you will get pushed to buy all.day when you are there and if you lime to lay on a seat you pay for that if you park you motoe bick you pay for that just have lots of smaill money on you 
jrnewson,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,We visited double six beach in May 2016 and found it to be clean with a very good surf. Their are resturants and bars attached to the rear of the beach and sun lounges and umbrellas are readily available.
Dabangg,"Edinburgh, UK",May 2016,"We went here to have dinner and for a quiet walk. This place is nice and numerous options available to have food. You may find many restaurants who have live bands playing for you. Beautifully decorated, it's nice!"
Katerinka S,2 contributions,Apr 2016,"super cool place, nice soft seats, drinks, sunset time is the best! highly recommended! very clean also, and good for surfing too"
kkwalia,"Chandigarh, India",May 2016,While staying at Horison Seminyak we visited the beach and loved its clear and clean water. Good for surfing
Morison H,30 contributions,May 2016,"Double six beach at Seminyak, Bali is th3 best spot to see sunset in Bali. Many people also held their romantic and memorable wedding ceremony at this beach. Highly recommended this beach for you to spend your holiday in Bali"
Taylor P,"Kuta, Indonesia",May 2016,Great place to sit down on a beanbag and have a few beers while watching the sun go down. Beautiful beach. 
samesdifd,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2016,"When you walk onto beach look to right and ask for Ozzie and Dee for your beds, table and umbrella. They are great young fellas and will look after you for drinks, alcoholic or otherwise and Ani for your fruit Jack for Henna tattoos and Ola for manicure and jewellrey. Lovely people have known them for years. The lady on the left does sensational Mee or Nasi Goreng for a pittance"
ENNEA,"Caen, France",May 2016,"The place To go absolutely in Bali for sunset. Large beach, a lot of ambiance bars with bands, many people...You can walk at least 10 km from kuta to canggu or even do jogging!"
Wombler661,"Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2015,"Great spot to rent a sunlounger + umbrella to relax and unwind. Hawkers sell different odds and ends, but generally leave you alone if you show no interest. Food is across the street, and the ocean is great to swim in."
AnaByn,"Makati, Philippines",May 2016,good hangout place with a lot of restaurants to choose from and with bands playing. Nice to watch the sunset here then have dinner around.
Flawlesswonder,"Roselle, NJ",May 2016,The water was clean and the water was so warm. I could have stayed in the water all day.  I appreciated the leather beach chairs and the umbrellas that we rented for a cheap 100k Rupiah. 
mattfrench68,"Colmar, France",Apr 2016,"A good start if you begin your trip in Bali. There are so many options to take surf lessons, rent chairs for the day, found some good restaurants and bars.Mixed of tourists and locals, especially if you have to assist to the sunrise, splendid and peaceful.Otherwise, it is surely not the most beautiful beach in Bali, but is also a nice place for kids."
Richvs1331,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"for those who loves surfing, or just sitting around watching the waves chasing each other, or the magnificent sunset, this is the best hotel that I would recommend you to stay. The breakfast is not only made to order and artistically presented, the taste is really delicious. The hotel is very conveniently located for restaurants, bar and cafes. Shopping is good too, everything is within walking distance. The rooms are spacious and very well laid and the design of the hotel is neat, modern and yet artistic. So, YES I personally vouche"
Yuli H,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"This beach is pretty nice, not busy as kuta bech.. but lots of people selling everything( sometimes it is really annoying).. Great place for drinks, sunset, and chilling with friends. This place is a must go!"
PokeTraveller,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,Here is the best sunset spot in Bali. Most of the cafes around has similer concept with a colorful pillow as chair and it's beautiful! 
brittanyontour,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,We were greeted with smiles each morning and the staff really go above and beyond! We only stayed five nights but it really started to feel like a second home! We will most definitely return in the near future. Highly recommended 
mey_htg,"Hong Kong, China",May 2016,Just for adult beach. Never bring your babies here...there are few gay club near it and most of those club visitor went to double six for sunbathing naked. 
Tangogrl,"Montreal, Canada",May 2016,"Fabulous waves to boogie board your heart away and/or learn to surf. However, beach very crowded & not all that clean. Some garbage in the water. Try and avoid the area right next to the small river - it doesn't smell very nice."
Leeanne H,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Fantastic little cafes and restaurants along this beach makes it full of atmosphere.  Can sit back and have a drink, have a bite to eat, watch the kids in the water and then watch the sunset.  After dark most of the beach Cafes have entertainment.  A must do while in Bali!! "
Kiwis_in_the_sun,"Charlestown, Australia",May 2016,Visited in May and unlike other reviews in April we found the beach to be clean of rubbish and the water to be clear like in Australia. Obviously May is a very quiet time in Bali  and our preferred time to visit. The prices are cheaper as everyone is trying to get your business. Highly recommended place to stay in May.
mitchmad1,"Davistown, Australia",May 2016,"great little bars and restaurants all along the beach, can walk to kuta or echo beach on the sand or paved walkways"
207Liz,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"If only the beach was kept clean it would make a huge difference, and that goes for the general area around Legian/Seminyak. There was a lot of rubbish and not enough bins. I did notice locals dumping their rubbish - this is a real shame as it real spoils the landscape and tourists complain. Local authorities need to take action and enforce penalties. Bali is a great place to visit but they need to clean up their act otherwise people won't return."
Teigan F,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Apr 2016,"We got told by the locals that we would love this place and boy did we. The cocktails on the beach, the live music and atmosphere was amazing! "
Aashaya,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2016,I would recommend this restaurant for breakfast.The set menu is good value and for a healthy start the fruit with granola is my choice.I am sure that lunch and dinners would be of the same standard although as we do not live that closeWe usually make it our Sunday morning favourite to catch up with friends.
Cags1960,"Ashington, UK",Apr 2016,"A nice wide beach , hot sand but plenty of beach bars to cool off in. Ideal to watch the sunset but gets a little busy"
Lauren M,"Canberra, Australia",May 2016,"Dirty beach with lots of rubbish. Rough/choppy surf which I wouldn't go into unless I was a strong swimmer, wouldn't allow my children to go in. There are red and yellow flags to indicate safe areas to swim but the life savers don't appear to take their job seriously so it is a bit of a gamble if you aren't confident in strong surf. If you're looking for a nice beach go down south to uluwatu and nusa dewa. I did go for drinks at sunset a few nights though and it was very nice to see the sun set over the water while listening to live music. Also please not in Australian so I'm very used to beautiful beaches!"
Dennis R,"Swansea, Australia",May 2016,We forced ourselves to see the sun rise rather than sleep in. Definitely worth it to join all the many others along the beach. It is much nicer than we thought and gets the cobwebs out of the way in preparation for the day. Time to sleep later
anastasiameivia,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2016,"Thanks to Harris Seminyak Hotel that gives facility to us so we can go to Double Six Beach. Harris Hotel gives us facility in the form of shuttle bus and shedi.We love the beach. My 6 year old cousin also enjoy it. The wave is good, many surfer come here. Love it"
Rachel A,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"Great for a nice sunset, and a bite to eat. Recommend going to Coccon beach club for the two for one cocktails then walking down the beach for the sunset :)"
Salahaldeen  Z,"Amman, Jordan",Apr 2016,"The Double Six beach is a perfect getaway to relax under an umbrella and have a couple of drinks , the waves are medium and the beach is clean just beware of the scammers at the entrance of the beach telling you that you have won a complementary prize , also there are many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach itself.Would return again "
Kerrie W,"Christies Beach, Australia",Apr 2016,"One of my favourite beaches for beach bars, catching up with friends and watching the stunning sunsets"
charles k,Las Vegas,Apr 2016,got a room on ground floor next to pool and great ocean views. everything as described in web picture. the staff were incredibly professional and polite and well trained. breakfast was amazing as was dinner at the 4th floor restaurant. Best service we've had in a long time! highly recommended
Richard C,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,An amazing looking hotel resort with a lagoon pool.We stopped in for a cocktail each which was reasonable priced at $13 
jonytt,malaysia,Jan 2016,not the most spectacular of beaches nor the prettiest but since its there and i was staying near by so thought would pay a visit but its something you would do once and not again
Simon W,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Ok so firstly we had fun here, hired 3 day beds, surf boards for the kids and had a few drinks on the beach. What did I learn,1. Ask advise from others who look like they have been here before... I did and saved me some $$ 2. Day beds, don't pay over 50k for 1, they will also try and put a time limit on you? Just say no this is for as long as I want. 3. Drinks, I wandered up to a bar and paid full price for drinks first up, watching others I found the guy who rented you the bed will also being you drinks at a cheaper price than the bars. 4. When hiring a surfboard haggle (as with everything else in Bali.. Also don't fall for the 'you have to have lessons to hire this board' if you can surf just say no if will cost you far less. 5. Expect hawkers, you will have people come try to sell you bits and pieces. If your not interested let them know and they will move on. 6. Have fun!! Your in Bali for crying out loud!! "
SavertFamily,"Zeist, The Netherlands",Apr 2016,"We stayed at the Double-Six hotel and loved this beach every day. It is simply stunning with very nice places to drink, eat and lounge."
Timothy B,45 contributions,May 2016,"Having traveled the world this beach is nothing that will take your breath away. One of the most crowded beaches in Bali and not known for its beauty.Ideal for beginner surfers to get their lessons. Not very peaceful as you will be approached by a storm of beach boys and other vendors trying to sell you their products and services. Better to go to Uluwatu, Nusa Dua, Amed, Gianyar, Canggu etc. "
Claire N,"Scarborough, Australia",Apr 2016,"We still love a beer on the beach, we always sit at Aussies bar it's just fun.  We do our souvenir shopping for the kids while we have a beer, massage and buy our fruit.You have to be prepared to be swarmed by the hawkers and be able to get rid of those you don't want to buy from- my method is be really nice and have fun with them but be up front and let them know right away that you're not interested and if you tell them you are then you should buy it from them and not waste their time arguing over 50 cents.  We get the cheapest prices on the beach and the fruit is always fresh and fabulous. It's important to remember this is whats done on the beaches in Bali, you can't be rude to these guys this is just what they do.Its a fun place to meet other travelers and have a chat, share experiences and make plans.Always worth a sit down for a icey cold drink . :-)"
junior g,Singapore,Jan 2016,Nice beach but very busy. Full of beach side bars & cafe with bean bags seating on the beach. Good for drinks and sunset.
Miftakul Huda,Indonesia,Apr 2016,"At least once a in week, i have to visit Seminyak Beach at least for just enjoying sunset with friends chit chat and drinks at the bech as long you are fine with crowded since somes full of people on the weekend. You may choose Meatball it called Bakso in Indonesian for snackin, many places to have chill out during sunset here. Some tourists also love to have tanning here but im prefer going to south for tanning "
krayfi,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"We popped by here to check out the beaches in Seminyak. This is a crowded beach albeit a long stretch and had waves for surfing. We snapped our sunset shots from here, walked the beach for a little and felt it was time to go."
RnRMartin,"Geelong, Australia",Apr 2016,"We love this area of Seminyak.... the atmosphere along the beach is amazing.  Plenty of dining options to suit all budgets, or just relax in a bean bag on the sand and watch the spectacular sunset."
andrew c,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2016,"The beach is awesome,much way better than kuta beach,try to catch a sunset here with a tremendous local food called bakso(meatball) along the beach.if bakso not your thing you can choose an international restaurant surrounding the beach."
TerjeHoegberg,"Oslo, Norway",Aug 2015,"When it comes to enjoying lazy beach life, or enjoying the sunset,  it's much better than the most famous Kuta beach. Less surfers, less beach vendors and less tourists."
Mohamed Abri,"Canberra, Australia",Apr 2016,"Lovely beach with lots of stalls, restaurants, & beach chairs. You can get one of the multiple stalls to get your drinks while you relax."
nanean,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"A few years ago we were here in the rainy season and it was awful, with rubbish everywhere, washed up by the sea.  This last year, it was lovely, crystal clear water and quite clean.  Nice little beach.  Especially good if you can get there in the early morning (pre 8am).  Locals fishing, local kids playing.  Lovely scene."
tanmalakaadi,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"on my business trip, i was trying to spent time in the late afternoon to release my stress.and I've found a fabulous view in here!"
RBC123,Northern Ireland,Apr 2016,"Water warm and inviting to go swimming, Great waves, lots of people surfing.Just lie back and relax."
June H,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,My name is George Hondris and I recently took my 3 children and there kids to The Double Six. What an experience. All staff from the General Manager down to the pool staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and we shared 3 bithdays up there and have unforgetable memories that we have taken home regarding this modern State of the Art Hotel.We will be back in September and cant wait. I have been to Bali 51 times and this hotel is the best by far. Give it a try you wont be dissappointed. Excellent view & service.
Brad H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2015,"Double Six is the go to place for sunset drinks and chilling with friends.  Most places offer bean bags on the beach, free wifi and table service usually with accompanying acoustic bands or techno music. Some spots are better than others so walk around until you find one you like."
Dodde_Mokarisma,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Apr 2016,"I believe the double six beach in one the best spot to enjoy the sunset in Bali, and the world also ! pristine white sands, plenty of food option and the easy access. However the small road and limited parking space for care could be a problem for those we drive here. "
RichytNZ,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2016,"Head down to Double Six Beach around 5:00 pm in the evening, grab a beer and snack from one of the vendors and relax and watch the sunset"
MiteshK,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2016,"If you're looking for a beach for eating, drinking, live music and some sheesha, this is the place to be..there are plenty of shacks with bean bags that are usually on till 11 PM. Tried other beaches such as seminyak Legian and Kuta..which are otherwise great beaches but only till sunset. "
sammytee069,"Queenstown, New Zealand",Apr 2016,Great little bars/restaurants on this beach with cheap but tasty meals. Fantastic at sunset and a great chilled place to be
DeeceeVictoria,Victoria,Apr 2016,"went to try the roof top bar, went to sit out side and told to sit here you need to spend over $100, but we could sit inside if we like, inside the music was so loud we had to yell, its a huge space which didn't appeal so we left and went to the roof top bar at the Anantara and had a great night. What's also a bit off putting is the evening gowns the staff at the double six roof top bar wear, your on the beach not at a grand gala ball."
Darrin D,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2016,I took a long walk from Potato Head down to Cocoon recently on a Saturday afternoon and the views were spectacular. BUt what also struck me was the local use. Indonesian families and children everywhere playing soccer and otherwise coming together to enjoy that natural beauty of this place. Its as if I was being welcomed into the lives of these wonderful and spiritual people. It was a joy to experience. Oh and the sunsets are fabulous.
Teegs30,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,Great beach to visit but people trying to sell you stuff over and over again is a pain! Stay in the water! Boogey boarding and surfing great!
Dushanthan,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Apr 2016,The beach is quite big and it has been divided for the surfers separately as well. The beach is quite clean and nice. The bars around the beach are bery good but the they are very cheap as well.
Sulacool,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"very close with seminyak beach and be one bay that place, nice and more quite just for siting and swimming can also enjoying the sunset at afternoon time"
depends on the weather,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"Love the sunset, the smiling people, bintang and beanbags. A bit dirty but its a fun place and even a few good waves."
CharmianG,Melbourne,Apr 2016,"Not bali cheap but great venue and unique, people are lovely and good quality. No problem with the min spend howver 6-7 dollars for a Bintang is a little pricey! Food is excellent quality and will return. Great to see sunset, we arrived at 5pm which was perfect..."
512ren,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2016,One of many beach in Bali that perfect for viewing sunset. There are also a lot of cafes and bras alongside the beach
bcmum,malaysia,Apr 2016,"Clean beach with deck sun chairs for rent. Relax with the crashing waves sound while the kids enjoy the sand and waters. Music plays as the sun sets,  a bliss with a cocktail prior to dinner."
syortaimer,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"We visited this beach after dinner, so it's a bit late for sunset viewings, but the ambiance was never a letdown. We roamed around enjoying the vibrant beach, listening music from one club to another. When it got late, the clubs were off, the situation's getting more intimate than ever for you can see scenery around and the quiet, calm atmosphere won't let go. Definitely the place if you plan to go night-talking for 2-3 hours to go."
AkhilBiju,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2016,It's nice beach but the restaurants and the other guys giving the beach beds and other stuff over charge and tend to take people for a ride. Need to haggle extensively
G-HARP-CRAWLEY,Crawley,Mar 2016,"Stunning beach, amazing sunsets - great location. We spent a number of evenings on the beach, watching the sun go down - I guarantee you will get some amazing pictures. You will never get bored of sunsets like this. Great bars along the beach, with live music. I would 100% recommend spending the later afternoon and evening here.! "
lozza193,"Loganholme, Australia",Mar 2016,My husband and I spent a day here and hired 2 day beds with a surfboard for quite cheap. The weather was lovely so it was a nice day and really fun for surfing with a longboard but the amount of people walking along selling you things got a little bit annoying. Some would stop for a good amount of time and just stand in front of you even when you were saying no. Apart from that a nice morning on the beach
puchochot1,"Duxbury, VT",Apr 2016,"We spent a couple of days on Double Six Beach across from the Seaside Mexican restaurant in the Gay-friendly section of the beach.  Look for the small rainbow flag on a poll.  The guys who work on the beach are friendly and attentive.  They moved chairs and umbrellas to make sure everyone in our party was comfortable and fed.  Nothing beats a day on the beach with seaside food and drink service.  Just be sure to wear your sandals, because the sand can be as hot as burning coals."
ramabaskoro,22 contributions,Mar 2016,"Sunset, Beach, Acoustic. Perfect Harmony. Love this beach! My favorit beach spot while i'm in Bali. Only need to take a walk for 10-30 minutes from hotels around Seminyak area.But, hey, where is the Caesar Palace? one of the good cafe in Double Six, replaced by D'Joglo when my last visit."
Tino J,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"White shandy beach, perfect for sun bath & surf. It's only 10 minutes drive from our accommodation Hotel Ibis Styles Bali Petitenget."
Steve T,41 contributions,Mar 2016,"A mediocre beach - not very clean, full of hawkers and hassling sun lounger reps. Lard and tattoos everywhere. Not for me."
badbillybong,Hawaii,Mar 2016,"The beaches (water quality, sand, etc.) from Kuta to  Seminyak are quite dirty. Open sewers floating into the water, garbage galore both in the water and on the beach. If you're looking for light colored sand, clean crystal water, this side of Bali is not where you  will find it. Up and down the beach, you can take surf lessons, rent boards, rent an umbrella and loung chair. And by 5pm or so, the bean bag chairs are pulled out (free to use) and the party atmosphere begins. People playing soccer, music, lights, etc. We found the apres sunset scene to be a lot of fun. During the south swell season, stays offshore until about 10-11am and there's thumping head high ++ beach break...though pretty much walled except for the odd corner/shoulder that forms near the channels. But again, the water is bordering on filthy, disgusting at most spots."
Shirley Wu,"Shanghai, China",Mar 2016,"I have been to this beach 5 years ago. it was ok but not too crowed. last week i have been to Seminyak again so i went to Double six beach to see the sunset. i think like most people said already this beach is nothing special, sea is not beautiful as blue one. if you travel already other seas like Gili island or Phiphi island, please dont expect a beautiful water here. its a beach not very clean even. only thing is the sunset is ok. or if you want to hang out with some friends to have drink in the bars on the beach. otherwise no nothing special here."
amandabenjaminb,Razorback,Aug 2015,Close to everything Seminyak has to offer. We stayed in the 1 bedroom pool Villa and the facilities were 5 star.
daphne928,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"Love this part of the beach as has what ever u want from manicures, massages, food, drinks and u dont even have to move from your beach chair"
Rebecca_andAmir,"London, UK",Feb 2016,This beach was extremely clean and is perfect for enjoying the sunset.  The beach is not too busy and offers the opportunity to surf or sit and eat/ drink.
TIersHasie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"If you're after a more quiet less busy beach close to Kuta/Seminyak this would be a good choice.The mostly clean and off white sandy beach offers calm waves and a few activities during the day such as horse riding, surfing lessons.At night there is some nightlife but I preferred Seminyak beach for nightlife more."
woojin2016,"Beverly Hills, CA",Nov 2015,"Located in Legian, bit quieter than Kuta. Good place to walk in the morning without having direct sunlight (West coast of Bali)"
Satya R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,The beach is not as busy as Kuta.. Much cleaner with some nice waves too.Only around 10 minutes from kuta and seminyak.
Sunset Lise,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,Great to watch the local Bali kids playing beach games and the dogs playing in the water. Love the colourful bean bags and cold beers and cocktails whilst checking out the wares of the street traders. 
ALYSSE16,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Mar 2016,Double six is in a great location for those wanting to experience the real Seminyak atmosphere and night life. The service was excellent and I felt comfortable the entire stay. However the only down side was that my room had a few issues with lighting and technology not working - in saying that the butler had an engineer on site quickly and it was remediated quickly. would recommend for people wanting to experience great hospitality in Seminyak. 
bbrteam,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"The stylish location has a great vibe. You can book a sunken lounge, but phone at least a day ahead. 1mil minimum spend on food/drink for a sunken lounge booking. Also, make yourself aware of the dress code or you won't be admitted. Various food options avaible, finger food in your lounge, or an Italian meal down stairs in the resturant."
S√∏ren H,"Roskilde, Denmark",Mar 2016,"We went to one of the many beach bars with chairs on the beach, and even on a quite cloudy day the mood is fantastic. The beach itself is quite shallow, but there can be waves depending on the wind direction. The beach is wide well suited for children."
Shridhar_Jaju,"Yavatmal, India",Mar 2016,"The Double Six beach is a very clean beach along that stretch of Bali's coastline that extends from beaches at Kuta to Seminyak.Given that it's the tropics, the sun can be unforgiving during the day and you will need to grab a seat with the shade of an umbrella. You do get a beautiful view of the sunset from the beach. For those interested, the beach makes a very good vantage point to watch flights land / take off at / from the Ngurah Rai Denpasar Bali Airport every few minutes.There are a large number of shacks and small restaurants serving through the day and hawkers will be around everywhere you look trying to sell their wares. One might think of that as a problem, but they don't trouble you much if you've said a firm 'no'.The evenings see a rise in the crowd - locals and foreigners alike. You will see people trying to surf on the waves, play a game of football on the beach, take walks alone / with their dogs, and just doing a wide variety of activity all along the beach. On the whole, it's a wonderful place to relax for a few hours in Bali."
Richard W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Love to just lay around relaxing in the sun just watching the day go by not a care in the world , the way a holiday should Be . Yes there is hawkers everywhere but that's Bali love it or hate it they are just doing there job. "
David E,"Legian, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Bali's west coast has no shortage of beach spots. In fact, it's almost one endless beach strip for kilometers on end. However, of course, every area has it's own charm.For me, Double Six Beach is one of the best spots on the Island. One of the particular features is an abundance of nice beach bars which are especially great for sunset drinks, most of them equipped with bean bags for comfy seating, some of them have DJs, others live music. It's a very lively scene and there is a huge selection of excellent restaurants and beach clubs in the surrounding Seminyak neighborhood.Like in many other places, there are lots of surf schools around - its a good wave!All in all, perfect spot for sunset drinks and chill-out at the beach, a good win or surf - anything goes..."
Jo C,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Tekor Bali on the beach frount at Double six is a great place to eat at sunset great for fish and chips plus Arak Madus
Ferida H,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2016,Our Villa was only 400 meters to the beach. went there everyday to watch the sunset and have some drinks with friends. Great beach for surfing and swimming. The water was very warm. You have beach chairs and  umbrellas to watch the night away with plenty of music and live bands. Excdellent
Vicknesh K,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2016,A beautiful beach with colours and a great sunset to unwind with cold beers or cocktails. Can be a perfect romantic evening with your loved one or just a great bonding time with friends! This place is a must go!
ElleForder,"London, UK",Feb 2016,Had such a chilled time listening to the live bands on the beach play whilst enjoying the yummy cocktails!We lit fire lanterns and made a wish - hope it comes true!
Axle H,7 contributions,Mar 2016,"Again I was a little disappointed at double six beach when I visited it had rubbish strewn all over, there was a tractor attempting to clean but it just seemed to be moving sand, I prefer to head up to Legian beach where why there is some mess locals seem to clean up a lot "
31081957,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Great from spending the day at the beach to sunset drinks and dinner. Great music. A great pop in or you can stay all night.
Russell M,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2016,My wife and I enjoyed a couple of meals and some afternoon drinks  while watching the great sunsets. only problem is the overly loud music coming from Cocoon which spoilt the music from beach performers.
Petrina Y,Singapore,Jan 2016,Love the cafes on the beach front. Perfect for lazing the days away. Particularly breathtaking at night. A million times better than Kuta! Clean an beautiful beach!
Mike T,Newcastle upon Tyne,Feb 2016,"Beautiful beach, very popular with beach games and lots of mainly young people. Security guards are very evident plus the food was good and reasonably priced."
Angel Seraphina,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"Clean place and you can enjoy swimming and surfing in the beach with quiete friendly wave :D :D .. good place to enjoy the sunset ""when is not cloudy :D "
starkerama,"Alberta, Canada",Feb 2016,"We were SO disappointed with this beach. We were in Seminyak for 4 days hoping to surf and play in the water and we didn't dip a toe in once. Bulldozers would clean the beaches of garbage every morning, and it would continue to wash up all day. Truly disgusting and so sad. We've been to Kuta and Legian before and had never seen anything like this. We were told it comes on the tides from Java..."
kasalamd,"Marikina, Philippines",Feb 2016,"A stone's throw away from our hotel, this beach had beige grayish sand and was therefore, not too cool on bare feet. Still, our stay under the umbrella shades was quite relaxing.  Huge waves most enjoyable for surfers and for those who just like to ride on the waves! "
Dale W,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",Mar 2016,"Fortunately our hotel had a private area which allowed us to sun -bake comfortably.  That was the only highlight.The beach was riddled with plastic, paper and unmentionables.A drain was free-flowing into the sea causing brown waves that put most people off. Putting up with the beach vendors wasn't too bad, given that this is their only form of income.This beach is not somewhere I would advise anybody to swim at!"
Robbert,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"great to hang out on the beach, catch a wave or enjoy one of the nice restaurants on the beach or on the boulevard"
Gay T,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Jan 2016,This beach is beautiful and particularly gorgeous in the evening when the sun is setting.  Very nice also in the mornings for a nice walk.  
Polly199,60 contributions,Feb 2016,awesome selection of restaraunts and bars! Great place to unwind and relax in Seminyak!  Family friendly location
Kathirmathi V,19 contributions,Feb 2016,We arrived in the late afternoon in an effort to escape the hot sun. The most beautiful sunset was presented to us by nature. 
Chris-Bj-brisbane,27 contributions,Feb 2016,Great beach with perfect sunsets. Each area could try and clean up the rubbish that collects on the beach. some areas do a great job while others not so good. 
abangbala,"Bogor, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Really nice to visit, waiting for sunset with a bottle of beer or somekind of drink. Talking about anything, with live music. Very joyful. "
John D,"Barnstaple, UK",Feb 2016,"We have visited this beach are now twice in the last three months, staying for a week on both occassions.  The last time it was clear that the local authoritiy were struggling to keep the sand clean.  However I am more concerned that the water quality is very poor which is a real shame as the surf can be pretty good.  The open drain outlets appear to run directly into the sea, along the whole lenght of the beach.  I suspect this is a health issue (serious).  I would love to be told told otherwise."
summerbeachguy,"Queensland, Australia",Feb 2016,Take your pick on dining and drinking locations along here. There are plenty. A great spot to watch the sunsets and grab a nice light meal whilst laying in a bean bag on the beach itself under a lamp-lit beach umbrella with hundreds of others surrounding you and your friends.Life is good when you take a moment and absorb where you are!
Roger,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,"East access down a narrow lane, not crowded with clean white sand and safe sea.  Less packed than some of the other beaches."
Reea_ria,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Feb 2016,Nice place for having such a relax time and hanging out with friends. The sands was quite clean but there are some dogs around the beach. Good waves for surfers.
SedaEg,Istanbul,Aug 2015,The food options on this side of Seminyak beach are more international from tacos to pork ribs. However the beach itself is nosier and not as clean. Just take a walk down to Legian and both the ocean and beach will satisfy your vacation needs better.
EgleDesigns,"Shanghai, China",Feb 2016,"We came here to do some surfing. It's excellent for all levels, but be careful of the rips and pull of the water. Very strong, but fantastic time spent surfing. Lots of sun loungers, surf board rental places, bars etc."
Kat59623,United Kingdom,Apr 2015,Nice place for relax during a day and lively spot for the nights out. Great and clean beach. Packed up with surfers.
Thalia_RR,"New York City, NY",Jul 2015,DS beach is a great way to end your hectic day or meet up with friends after a long day of riding around on your bike!  There are a variety of simple places to hang out sit on  a bean bag with friends (or alone ) on the beach to watch the beautiful Bali sunset! this is what life is all about !
lesley s,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,"We walked  about a couple of k's from where we were staying to this beach as it was cleaner by far than Jepun Beach the sand was not as black either and more bars/restaurant's to chose from. We went in 10/2/16 a festival day in the Balinese calender and so many Balinese were leaving offerings along the beach which really added to the litter already strewn along the shore, we even saw a dead half buried chicken! It would be great if the Balinese could get onto the rubbish problem in general, when it rains the drains all block and results in flooding too. We were  told a lit of the rubbish on the beach cones from the PHILLIPINES??"
ruthojen,"Baltimore, MD",Feb 2016,"Depressing , filthy, proof that tourism destroys culture.nit should be a call to arms to have proper recycling in Bali and that each hotel should have a plan in place. It is a floating garbage can. "
Jason S,"Scamander, Australia",Jan 2016,"Every time I come to Bali I spend most evenings on the beach to watch the sunset.There is always something happening, Sports / WeddingsMany bars that have cold drinks, food & live musicI love grabbing a bean bag and just chilling for a few hours before heading off on a big night"
Linda P,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Double six beach is one of my family ""sunset spot"" place.The cleanes, the cafe arround, the ambiance were very nice."
Martin A,"Gingin, Australia",Feb 2016,"On our last day of our stay in Bali we headed down to the beach where our hotel had a beach club (basically chairs, towels and umbrellas). At first glance the beach is beautiful with a few restaurant/bar options. What we found as we went for a swim was the sand and the water inundated with rubbish, mainly plastic. We did have a big storm yesterday with loads of rain so I am not sure if the rubbish problem is exacerbated by stormwater discharge into the ocean which is likely. The black beach sand is like mud when wet and sticks to everything. We left shortly after and headed back to our hotel pool. "
Shazrazmataz,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2016,"This beach is dirty & smelly, there's litter everywhere & lots of stray dogs.The only positive is that it has great sunsets."
IntrepidNomad,"Urandangie, Australia",Jan 2016,The beach is beautiful at sunset and the Balianese at sunrise send the cleaning machines in to clean up all the debris that has been left behind or floated in. This beach is nice and wide and great for wandering along or going for a run.
Jean B,"Kensington, Australia",Jan 2016,Maybe because it's Sunday so it was full of people. The beach is looking better & more clean compare to Kuta beach. Mostly local people or local tourist. It has comfy seating area in many cafes at the beachside with live accoustic band performance when we're seeing sunset. Lovely time!
preplady,Virginia,Jan 2016,We took maybe a 3-mile walk here.  It's very pleasant & amazingly quiet for a beach in a touristy area.  There are lots of restaurants & bars & places to take surfing lessons & the surf looked great!
BigJoan66,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,A nice place to stop off before dinner for a quick drink or two whilst watching the beautiful sunsets. 
Larry0807,"Townsville, Australia",Dec 2015,"Get down to Won's beach bar just in front of the Kumala Pantai Hotel, great service, ice cold beer and the small warung on the beach serves fresh, cheap lokal food."
Helen L,"London, UK",Jan 2016,"Great beach to get some body board waves equal to Cornwall but 20 degrees warmer.Beach hire subbed and board so cheap...beach vendors no hassle, just say no...nicely Some great waves for those who don't go out of their depth and just want fun in the sea."
ddarwen,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,There are many shops here along the beach selling food and drinks. There are peddlers around selling from steam peanuts to kites. Stalls here set up lounge chairs and umbrellas by the beach for patrons to sit and chill. Waves were not to big but there were a few people surfing. It was a nice place to just chill with friends drinking coconut juice and watch the sunset. 
Danielle,"Orem, UT",Jul 2015,"This beach reminds me of the ones back home in California. Except for one fact, the waves here are HUGE. Perfect beach to catch some surfing or boogie boarding. They have so many people renting out surfboards and boogie boards for a reasonable price. You can even get a surf lesson from the locals. Plenty of bars along the beach, no way you'd get hungry. There's lots of cute stray dogs walking around. There are many hagglers who will offer you some pretty cool trinkets. They're not too pushy. Just expect it everywhere you go. Remember they're human and just trying to support their families is all."
Donna B,"Bunbury, Australia",Jan 2016,This beach is awesome with lovely wavesBe aware of strong undertow especially weak swimmersBeach was pristine clean no rain to wash in waste Would recommend this areaGreat beach shacks with music and food
Kay549,"Reading, UK",Apr 2015,"Wonderfully clean when I visited, though apparently ocean currents can wash litter on to the beach at some points of the year. "
himeshinra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Kuta Beach is just way too crowded and way too many pushy hagglers. The people in Double Six beach are nicer and most of the sellers are not too pushy and more polite, but you have to negotiate your way for lower prices even though they're offering prices lower than Kuta Beach. Still, you can definitely R&R in this beach. Good for couples as this beach is one of the popular dating spot in Bali. In the evening the beach gets more crowded by locals and families and dogs, and you can move to one of the bean bags at the seaside cafe and watch the sunset with live music and margarita. "
Norine007,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,lovely clean beach with good vibes watch out for the hawkers can be annoying. many cafes and places to drink and eat. you can go cheap or you can ramp it up a bit whatever your taste.
Êñ∞Âä†Âù°ÊûóÂ≥∞,Singapore,Jan 2016,"Visited the beach around 5pm. Parking the bike by the beach pavement cost u 2k IDR, sat down at one of the restaurants, ordered a beer and sat down to enjoy the sunset. There is also live band in front at the beach, where one can relax at the beanbags with a beer in hand, a pizza and enjoy the sunset. Woah...Went into the sea and enjoy the waves at you. There are rental of surf boards available. Overall good relaxing experience..."
ratan3,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2015,Had been to double six beach. Less tourist and wonderful clean and neat beach. Best to lay around on a lazing evening
Sarvs F,Te Atatu,Jan 2016,We stopped off at the Blue 9 Beach bar and it was a lovely relaxing way to spend a quiet afternoon after a whole day of sightseeing.They were setting up the speakers for a night of entertainment and unfortunately we didn't stay long enough to enjoy but we got there at a good time in the afternoon to secure seats as I am sure it would pack up quickly.  The bean bags are uncomfortable though so some new biggers one wouldn't go astray.  We did sit at a table also but for an evening with cocktails to take in the evening entertainment you need to be on the bean bags!Good and friendly service.  We ordered a chicken pizza which literally had one small piece of chicken on each slice and the crust was tough.  Go for the drinks and environment not necessarily the pizza.
melmitchell_melb,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,We were here in July - and it was beautiful.  Came back in December and it was almost knee-deep in rubbish.  Just disgusting.  The Balinese claim that it's a naturally occurring seasonal event (there's a sign on the beach to this effect).  More like rubbish being washed down with the rains.  Such a shame as it is a beautiful beach - it would be good if they could do something about it.
Jaad87,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"Really comfy sunbeds for 50k. Not the cleanest beach in the world, but in general people don't know what to do with rubbish in Bali. Many locals come after 5pm (when it is less hot) to enjoy the beach and watch the sunset. Many hagglers trying to sell you stuff - just pretend you're sleeping!!!"
ichembilath,29 contributions,Jan 2016,"The view of the sunset from here was awesome! It wasn't heavily crowded when I got there but the place tends to be crowded at times, nevertheless it's a great place to be. Well maintained, clean and the locals are quite friendly. A note though, drinks bought from the beach maybe costlier than buying outside!"
irresistibal,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"This beach is considered as one of the most famous and most visited in Bali, the reason being is that the beach has a long stretch and wide stone-coloured soft-sandy beach.A famous bakso (meat balls - local streetfood) stall by the name ""gerobak biru"" just across Kumala Pantai Hotel is a must-have items while enjoying the sunset over there."
MarkKarenEllie98,"Melbourn, UK",Jan 2016,"My kids went surfing there, guys on the beach hiring surf boards and offering lessons for $30 Australian for 2 hours"
nicola,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"What a way to spend a day or afternoon,relaxing on the beach under an umbrella,laying back on a sun lounge,watching the sunset,whilst having a drink brought to you.Locals take good care of you."
Andy G,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"The beaches should be so much cleaner. It's a pity as it detracts from the Bali experience. When walking along one has to watch out for all manner of rubbish, dog crap and general flotsam and jetsam, plus the open drains running into the ocean."
amin a,25 contributions,Dec 2015,"this beach is over crowded, they dont have good management in waste, its to many garbage in their sand and also they overcharged the food, quality of food is also not good at all"
Trisha M,Kinross WA,Dec 2015,It may have been because of the rainy season but when you walked into the water you could feel and see so mush rubbish floating around - the water was lovely and warm but we couldn't go into it - we know that the locals do their best to keep it clean but it just keeps washing up - the water further north of 66 beach is a lot cleaner and clearer
joceey,"Torquay, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great views of the beach and sunset, free entry so great just to go and have a look around. Had a wallet stolen on NYE and staff went above and beyond to get it back. Bar service however was terrible, one girl on the til so 45min waits, hopefully it was just a NYE issue."
Erlintirto,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,A perfect beach for watching the romantic sunset while you enjoy a cold beer in their cafes. For my teens they crazy for surfing all day time. In night you could enjoy the live music in each cafe with ur fam or friends.
Markie17,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"Amazing sunsetNice beanbags by the beach Sun, sand, sea, waves, kids playing soccer, vendors selling sky lanterns, fireworks, singers.. And not very expensive. Beach is abit dirty yes, but sunset alone is worth the visit "
kmtnmm,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2016,"The vibe here was magical.  Wonderful beach; pretty clean, great temperature, hari krishnas dancing up the sand with santa clause hats on, great food.  Just go."

sugiphang,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"the beach with a lot of sunset cafe, very crowded for enjoy the sea and sun. but little bit dirty. loves to morning run at the beach, and doing a good time with buddies."
rodrigoelp,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Between the plastic bags and other rubbish in the water and on the sand the illusion of a paradise island was quickly shattered. It was really disappointing upon arrival to the point my partner didn't want to take a seat on the sand for a little while (after a 25 minutes walk under the blazing sun and suffocating heat).Saw a surfer coming out of the water with the southern cross tattooed on his shoulder (Aussie mark), asked him how good was the water and replied ""got it going for a bit, then lost it when three plastic bags got tangled to my leg, right now I am going to wash the frustration it down"""
Virag2811,"Ahmedabad, India",Dec 2015,the place is at good location. nice hotel. we just went to chill out. view from the roof top was spectacular just like place. visit it once and have a drink. only veg food option was potato wades/fries.
caron s,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Visitors have trashed the place, sadly. Great surf and board rentals, lessons are cheap and plentiful."
FLT1904,"Mittagong, Australia",Dec 2015,"We have swum at Double Six Beach for numerous days and the first day was fabulous, but then there was a bit of rain and the next day the beach was covered in rubbish , on the beach, in the water. We returned a few days later and still rubbish, then it seemed to improve. Apart from the rubbish the beach was good."
BrianC5,"Vancouver, Canada",Dec 2015,Sorry but I am tired of saying no to vendors who do not listen and continue to harass me and others who are just trying to relax on the beach and enjoy a Bintang.
Kimtikawaka,"London, UK",Dec 2015,We visited the beach 5 days before Christmas and had to sit on sun loungers a few feet away from a tide of trash that had washed up on the sands. People were having to walk amongst it and over it to get to the sea. It was absolutely filthy and stretched right along the beach. I can't believe this is one of the main attractions of the area. I see that other people have left very good reviews so I imagine the beach must be cleaned at certain times of year. I won't be recommending this to anyone I'm afraid. 
Mukta A,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,"Very nice beach, full of fun and peace. Nice location. 24*7 shop is there for everything you need. must visit"
Selena39,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2015,"Nice beach for afternoon drinks or food. Definitely not the golden sands of our Australian beaches, but great for a refreshing dip with the added character of beach bars. The street hawkers are there but very polite and no hard sell. Beautiful sunsets."
Ryw Surf Lesson B,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"Surf Lesson, Surf Photography, Surf Trip.Enjoy the waves in Double Six Beach.. With our surf instructor and ride your wave, we will capture your moment stand up on surfboard."
FleecySqueezyFizzy,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Nice view but too crowded. I prefer quiet beach where i can enjoy the space, the ambience and admire the sea."
Sonia D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,When you visit Double six beach be sure to stay for a drink a dusk. They set up bean bags and tables on the shore and you can enjoy a drink whilst watching the ocean and people watching. The guys that look after you are amazing and only too happy to look after your needs. Most of the cafes and restaurants serve great cheap food.
kellysherry,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,fun and atmosphere great. close to lots of drinks and food. Massages and the water. can rent sunlounge at a reasonable rate
Aussie D,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,There is loads of things to do on this beach and it would be a good beach to learn surfing on for the beginner.
SunilNambiar,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2015,"Double Six beach was just a short walk away from where we stayed in Seminyak. The beach is clean & flat and the waves just right to have fun with. There were red flags at parts indicating strong undercurrents. The beach had vendors all along renting out sundeck chairs and umbrellas. We didn't opt for these as it was already nearing sunset. Local Kids playing football made a refreshing sight - and you could join in if you wish to. The beach is lined with a variety of restaurants - with almost all having a podium in front with the back facing the sea, and good singers crooning out popular pop numbers. The lane just adjacent yo the beach too had several nice eateries. A great night life spot in Seminyak."
ong_giri,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"nice place just relax on the beach and get full sun shine or get swim on the beach  or you could go for surfing , just nice in seminyak beach."
Micheal E,"Cairo, Egypt",Dec 2015,"This is the best Bar/restaurant on the beach, best time to be there is around sun set. Its one of the places you must visit during your stay in Bali. "
A2535ATjohnw,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Been here a couple of times. Its a nice beach, plenty of places to eat from cheap to expensive. Hawkers offer to sell you things, just politely say no and they move on. Not to big a surf. Family friendly"
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great beach with large sand breaks. Plenty of places to eat along beach, board hire and hawkers. One can even ride horses on this beach."
Stefanwar,France,Nov 2015,"First the location is incredible, lots of people, great flat beach and easy to go in the sea to play with the waves...(not the cases on all beaches). We rented body surf board for 50.000 rp the hour, quite alright but the sundeck chairs with umbrella are ridiculously expensive, after bargaining really hard we got 3 chairs for 200.000 rp, it was already 2 .30pm went we showed up and at 4.30pm she asked us to leave as the bar adjacent was setting up for the cocktail hours...total rip off. Next time I will go a little further away. Excellent location to listen to music and enjoy the sunset !!"
travellerone28,"Swansea, UK",Oct 2015,"Don't be put off by persons selling paintings, I bought three for approx 25 pound and was offered 150 each on my return to UK ! A lovely beach and setting highly recommended"
Batchy94,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2015,"I went down for a walk to double six beach for a look one morning, and I was quite impressed on the cleanliness of the beach, beautiful sand lounge chairs everywhere a few people trying to sell bracelets etc.. Despite that a great place to come for the day "
Thomas Hynes H,18 contributions,Dec 2015,Easy day on the beach - reasonably priced sun lounges with good drink service Water was perfect temperatureAlso great for a long jog along the beach
lalith1,"Panjim, India",Nov 2015,"This beach is famous  for its long stretch of clean beach.  Centrally located, it can be reached on foot . Popular with foreigners and tourists. "
Nieken29,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Nov 2015,More better then kuta beach...you sould visited..and on this beach there is cafe/restaurant for chill out with live music when sunset comes..
Paul,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,Nothing special really. Check it out if you'd like but there's nicer beaches further north. Lots of rubbish washes up at nighttime.
Fiona L,"Avoca Beach, Australia",Nov 2015,We just went to the bar!  Fabulous view.  Very modern and cool bar!  Wonderful mojitos!!  We went on a Tuesday night 2  for 1 prices!! Dangerous!!  Also BEST EVER popcorn chicken.  Delicious!
Ryder G,"Greater London, UK",Dec 2014,"We arrived at about 4pm, just as the sun was making its decent. Beach was busy, but there was plenty of room for people to move about without feeling that one was stepping on eachother's toes. Lots of activities going on along the beach from sports to family & couple gathering to impromptu food stalls and delicious sate grills. Spent about an hour there watching the sun go down and having a little paddle in the sea, before making our way back to our Villa transport that was waiting in the car park. All in all a nice break from all the shopping in Seminyak "
ridha w,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"My favourite place is here. DOuble six beach, I can do jogging, watch people play football , many tourist and local enjoy the beach. many cafes in here so no worries if we are hungry. "
Joan31100,"Toulouse, France",Nov 2015,"Very good spot, and eazy to access but this beach is to crowdy... You can see much better beach in bali by taking your scooter ony 15min, and if you are eazy on scooter, go to the Bukit ! Uluwatu, Dreamland, Impossible, Bingin... So much better !"
Carine P,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,"This beach isn't wowwwwww...its always full of families, its good for those who wanna learn how to surf, or is travelling with kids. Btw i have to warn that the water is sooooo cold, and there are a lot of option for places to eat, or just chill out and enjoy the beach."
Birgit K,"Munich, Germany",Nov 2015,"Impressive waves thundering onto the beach, which makes it a gr at surf spot, also for beginners. Deckchairs under umbrellas for rent, don't pay more than 100'000 IDR per day. Only ennerving are the constant flow of sellers coming buy......"
trishr798,"Newcastle, Australia",Nov 2015,Disappointed  nice location but felt food was overpriced and over cooked bacon rock hard eggs over cooked asked for soft and where hard Fresh fruit platter was tasty Felt it was a letdown considering our hotel provides a nicer breakfast included in stay 
tinesimanjuntak,"Bandung, Indonesia",Nov 2015,Sunset is so beautiful when I came. Really enjoyed watching sunset and sitting at the beach since they provide benches. However I don't really like the crowds.
ohclaramia,"Bunbury, Australia",Oct 2015,"Walking on this strip life is buzzing, beach live music, restaurants,with the warm temperatures life couldn't be any better"
Theasamiadji,101 contributions,Jul 2015,"comparing to Kuta Beach, this place is a little bit quite so you can enjoy and relax. Dont forget to buy Rujak Bali, traditional food sell by local people :)"
db9x,Indonesia,Nov 2015,"if you love to get tan, well you might be like this place. perfect place to spend time with friends during sunset, surfing (and oh i saw lots of sufring class sign -if you wanna learn this thing-). or drinks at the cafe all the way down. i came here alot because i love the clean beach and it's easy to find food :)"
Marwan83,146 contributions,Nov 2015,"Compared to Australia and the Red Sea, it is a poor beach. Only surfers would enjoy it. Not bad cafes and bars on the beach but alcohol prices is a bit high because of the location. "
marianne b,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,"Spent a lot of time in the beach shacks on double six . These are a great place to kick back and listen to some music, beach is clean. quite enjoyable"
Adsandme,31 contributions,Nov 2015,Went to see the sunset and had a drink at one of the beach bars and sat on the bean bags.. It was great seeing the waves and surfers. Then the music is blaring in all directions.. From the bars next to you as well as the one your sitting in which ruined the mood completely .. The beach isn't too clean and dirty compared to others
Kazcob,"Terrigal, Australia",Oct 2015,"Lovely hotel, great staff excellent restaurants.  Nothing was a trouble.  Very impressed would definitely stay here again"
Vee A,114 contributions,Oct 2015,"Didnt enjoy it as much during the day. The beach is a bit dirty along the sand and the water not clear. Waves are kind of rough, perfect for surfies I guess. At night,  hubby and I spent at least 5 hrs from sunset onwards, going from beach bar to beach bar sipping on cocktails and trying tapas. Locals sell stuff to you, lanterns, bangles, glow lights, kites you name it. Not a big deal at first, but one can only buy so many bangles in one night. The one man live bands are entertaining and we fell asleep at times, not sure if from the $4 smirnoff bottles or from their singing. Still, I loved hanging out there, I think I miss that most."
gael d,"Semarang, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Don't expect to take a rest on this beach. You will be harassed by boring people trying to sell you crappy paintings, cheap laser pointers or bad massage. They will come and try again every single minute..."
simon_macc,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,The most relaxing way to sit back at the end of the long day and watch the sunset. With a couple of Bintangs on the beach with the camera ready for that sunset shot.....
Mags132,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2015,They areas that get cleaned are ok but some areas not so good. Fun beach bars and restaurants line the beach but not the prettiest beach in Bali
Lizcurrier,"Billingshurst, UK",Oct 2015,"If you don't mind being hassled by beach sellers ( they are actually really nice and funny ) this is a good beach. The sunbeds are very comfy and have nice large umbrellas with them.Without leaving our sun beds we bourght sunglasses, had delicious fruit for lunch , a welcome ice cream ( nicely frozen still ) and enjoyed a massage.Wonderful sunsets."
Stefanii_Wjy,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Double six beach is an amazing place for waiting and watch sunset. we can choose one of the restaurant there. some of the restaurant provide music or (sometimes) live music to accompany us enjoy our evening.
HungryFriend,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2015,This beach is well-known for it's food. Along the beach there are many Cafe that provide beverages with Sea and Sunset view. Really nice place to spend afternoon while watching the surfers and the view. 
me020392,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Double six beach is one of gorgeous beaches in Seminyak. Relax your mind and bury your feet under the warm sand. Hey! You're the only Indonesian I guess!
Natalie K,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,Double six is the most happening place to be in Seminyak.  Beach activities are good.  Food is great.  Some really good quality shopping in Seminyak too.  Worth a trip when in Bali.
Bruce R,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,As a guest of Double Six Hotel we could also use the deckchairs by the beach spent a couple of hours each day just sleeping and watching the views just great.
Sn00py66,Darwin NT,Oct 2015,"We love to eat at all the different restaurants along this strip.Watching ""the Gadget Guys"" showing off their goods for sale is always amuzing.Sunset is lovely too."
puchka,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2015,"We visited the beach for a dinner date.   The entire Beach has eating joints each one vying for attention over the other, making it difficult to choose a place to eat.  Most of the beach front restaurants have their sit out areas on the beach under cover of umbrellas.  Surfing boards are available for the water sports enthusiasts.  Beach chairs with towels for the sunbathers and in the evening a lot of entertainment to go with food and wine.  A real fun place !"
Tracy f,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2015,everything at your feet massage sunset beanbag resturants music entertainment cocktails surf lovely locals 
Putu S,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"Double six beach is not a very clean beach, though it is one of the best places to learn how to surf since there are no corals or rocks. The waves are also ranging from 2m down to as small as it can be. I wouldn't recommend this beach to do anything else because the water from the sewage comes out just at the centre of this beach, so it smells and gets pretty dirty most of the times."
Pauline J,"Launceston, UK",Oct 2015,"We visited Seminyak & did plenty of walking, relaxing, reading & sleeping on this beach.Saw some reviews prior to visiting that put me off slightly, but it's got soft golden sand (that gets very hot) plenty of sun loungers, great views down to Legian & Kuta & you can see the planes land at the airport...watching them taxi down the runway looks like their ontop of the sea...very odd.We had a surf lesson with one of the surf schools, and the conditions were perfect for us. Sadly that day was the only day out of 4 that the conditions were good...as there were a few strong rips & the wind was in completely the wrong direction. Ah well, what can you do!Slight downside is the pushy old ladies wanting to massage you & the lookie lookie men who pester some what... don't let them bother you! Just a polite no & some ignoring seems to work.Sun loungers you could rent for the whole day...we ended up paying around 100k for the whole day... which was just less than a fiver.We personally found the restaurants along the back of this beach overpriced and nothing special... one or two of the beach bars were fun although they all seemed to have live singers on the beach which would sing over their neighbouring bars act...not the most relaxing thing to listen too...All in all good times spent on this beach!"
Andrew S,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Always full of people and the waves are great for surfing.  The sunset is also visible from here.  A few F&B land marks around here including Chez Gado Gado and Anantara Hotel
Julie E,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,"Great lbeach and umbrellas  available,  a choice of different restaurants on beach available with a reasonable area for family to swim and relax and have the choice of getting a drink and food near by.  Only toilet was in the restaurant if required but need to purchase something to use it."
mskatie1959,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Scattered bars with reasonable beer prices. Live music at night. Street vendors to buy yummy food from. Relaxing during the day, busier at night.  Love it. I will be staying closer to it on my next trip back in December."
ScooterOz,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2015,"Seminyak Beach is one of the nicer beaches to visit. There are several beach clubs but it is not too crowded with them and the surf is good. The beach is patrolled and flags are put up in the morning. There are a couple of surf schools operating there. Good location for restaurants etc. there are ATMs including an ANZ one, two mini marts. At night the beach comes alive in a nice family friendly way before the sun goes down."
Jan P,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Great beach with very big waves.  Good for surfing not so great for swimming as it is a bit dangerous with the current.
PJbig,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2015,Many different Beach Bars from the more basic ones in Legian to the built up ones in Seminyak (personally I prefer the basic ones for atmosphere and personalised service). 
yesdes,Melbourne,Jan 2015,"Not sure what the fuss is about. I found the beach dirty, littered with rubbish. Not great when you want to take a leisurely walk or dip. Next time I'll stick to Nusa dua."
Marie A,27 contributions,Jul 2015,"Good value, but you do get what you pay for. Worth the experience as it has great ambience right on the beach. Lots of choices and very casual and relaxed."
AustralianSlush,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,Amazing - cannot wait to return again and again!!!!!!Double Six staff & amenities are second to none.....luxury at it's best!!
Amine T,13 contributions,Oct 2015,"cool and enjoyable beach to watch and relax the sunset time, lot of coffees ,bars and  restaurants around and along the beachanytime visiting Bali , double six beach is a must visit place "
HXNNXH,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2015,"Came here in December 2014 with a girl friend and brought my boyfriend here with me this time. From the moment I laid eyes on this beach, I fell in love. The music, the sand and sea and waves. The wind. The fairy lights and colourful umbrellas. It's basically a whole stretch of beach bars. I think they're all pretty similar and have quite a range of drink selections. I usually go right before sunset and stay on for a couple of hours after. I would recommend picking a place with a live band. Can't get any better than a live band on a beach, with a cocktail (or bintang) in hand. Was pretty romantic. "
MatthewTheCatthew,"Fukuyama, Japan",Oct 2015,"Double Six Beach can only be described as the epitome of paradise. Endless sole soothing sand to sooth your soul as you stroll along and take in a sunset which forces even the most cynical among us to fall in love again with this world of ours. Beanbag restaurants complete with live musical entertainment, all by candlelight and the warming glow of the setting sun provide the perfect way to spend an evening in easily one of my favourite places in our natural world."
Hailey N,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,"Perfect spot to watch the sunset. Located in seminyak, good vibe around sunset . During the day there are lots of sun beds and before sunset they all get packed up and out come the colourful bean bags and umbrellas. Heaps of different bars to choose from along the stretch, with good food and drinks, and some with live music. "
Christoo M,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"Double sex beach(66 beach) its good and nice pleace and good for surf aslo and in the afternoon you can come to see the sun set a wail have a botol of bintang,and aslo you can have a full body massage there,or you aslo can call the therapist to give you a good massage in your hotel or villa after from beach."
HowardDG,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Great for sun tanning and great restaurant's on the sand which deliver F&B to your day beds .The beach sand is cleaned from rubbish washed up from the sea every morning and you welcome to give a hand around 6am when I'm still in bed-hehe
Deadgeckoo,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"The benefit of Double Six beach is that there are some rather nice beach bars along the stretch that give parts a nice boho vibe.  The beach itself isn't that nice - though if you're willing to shell out for drinks you can usually nab a sunbed or beanbag.  Ok, for swimming if it isn't too windy."
Sandra M,15 contributions,Sep 2015,"My husband and I have been coming here for a few years now and everytime we leave with a smile.From the beautiful ladies selling their wares to the abundant eateries.The atmosphere is like a village and everyone is welcomed with a smile and good conversation.The women are who make it for me.They have big smiles and bigger hearts and no matter how long between visits,they remember you and share a laugh.The waves are perfect for beginners,facillities are everywhere.Nothing is too much trouble for the hard working locals who give this area its soul.Fantastic community if you take the time to watch,listen and enjoy."

adechan2015,Makassar,Aug 2015,"Nice beach with many place for chilling like La Plancha, etc. Oh well, one of the best spot to see sunset in Bali! You'll love it :)"
SweetbixNZ,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2015,"Slick place to go in the afternoon.  Lay on some bean bags and enjoy the sunset whilst getting drinks and food.  So good.  Then later as the night goes down, just spin some good yarns, meet people then go back to where for Netflix and chill."
dmcallis73,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2015,"Nice spot, also bars and restaurants around, nice relaxed place. Chairs available, normally you need to pay or be at one of the bars. "
Changchunlaowai,"Tongren, China",Sep 2015,"Convenient spot to meet friends and relax, but better beaches elsewhere. Easy to get a beer and chill out. Some surf was OK."
DithaXie,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Average beach, not for swimming nor enjoying the water. But best for evening walk to enjoy the sunset, you can see peoples plyaying football, running, or just playing the sand"
ketutdamar,"Ubud, Indonesia",Jul 2015,nice beach visit during sunset time . many place for chill out . good food and drink. some balinese women try to sell small thing . good spot for learn to surf.
bj582015,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,bright lights at night and lots of choice for food and lots of fine western style  music... beach sellers can be a problem in the day..... close to lots of restaurants but also food on the beach is 
Chris S,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2015,"Best place in Bali for sundowners, find a bean bag, plonk yourself down, order a drink, and drink in the atmosphere at sunset....."
Sunflower,United Kingdom,Jul 2015,"Great surfing beach, especially with Santai Surf school. Beach umbrellas and loungers are available for hire. Lovely sunsets"

keshia w,9 contributions,Sep 2015,"Went there every morning for 3 days to play in the waves, get a tan and body board. The beach is dotted with colourful beach chairs and umbrellas that can be 'rented'. You just need to order a drink or two. My boyfriend and I ordered a coke and a bintang beer for SGD14 (pretty extravagant but we took it as rental for the chairs) and that entitled us to use their chairs for the whole day. We also rented 2 body boards for SGD10 for whole day use. Double six beach was away from the busy Kuta area, but can still get pretty crowded on the weekend. The waves here can get quite big and the under current can also get quite strong. Would suggest that parents keep their children close and in sight at all times. There were some points where I almost fell due to the strong under current. There were peddlers approaching us to purchase things from them, but once you say no they won't bother you so much. Or you could also close your eyes and pretend to sleep when you see them approaching your direction. All in all, this is a great place to rest, relax, people watch and learn surfing if you're up for it. It costs about SGD30 for 1.5 hours lesson."
Nicole L,"Mascot, Australia",Sep 2015,"Great spot to sit on the beach at one of the many bars and take in the beautiful sunsets.   Choose any bar, they are all pretty much similar.  Can get busy at sunset as its a popular spot.  "
Jadex3,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"Not much beach activities except for surfing. Just relax and chill on the lounge, grab some drinks and do people watching and watch the sunset (if it's not cloudy) "
Jamboash,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"Great place to relax on the sun chairs, be prepared for people trying to sell you stuff but you can get a manicure on the beach for a great price! You can also rent surfboards by the hour for a good price. "
Robert A,6 contributions,Sep 2015,"pros : huge landscaped beach, a lot of food choice from cafes to warong, affordable price of food, cons : a lot of dogs sometimes can be intimidating"

Paul F,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Great location, beautiful sunset.  bean bags on the beach.  friendly wait staff bringing you cocktails and beers (plus food if you want) on the beach.  very relaxing."
dwt991,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2015,"Great spot to sit and have a few bintangs and watch the sunset... Plenty of seats and umbrellas where you can get a drink and some bakso... In the evening try the dragon eggs sold by some of the hawkers on the beach, fantastic.."
Kelly M,18 contributions,Mar 2015,We had a lovely view from not only our room but our favourite bar. Prime location and not too busy.  Great place to spend a day and enjoy the sourounds.
monalitar,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"I'll tell you what, during my 6 days in Bali, I visit this beach 3 times. Twice for sunset and once for surfing (I am a total newbie anyway)The beach is very near from the city, and there are so many shops on your way here, for those who love window shopping (or shopping) it's like a paradise. I told you.For sunset, there are so many restaurants and bar all along the beach which offer you table on the beach with beanbag to just chill, awaiting sunset. And the food, I consider them cheap. Some of them have live music too.I learnt how to surf here for the first time too. There are so many stall that offer surf learning, and it's bloody fun!"
LukenAsh,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"no matter were you stay in Bali you should try going to double six beach and go to one of the bean bag bars or just enjoy to water and sunsets.if you jump in a taxi and a say double six beach and they will drop you at the end of the street and walk to the beach, lots of restaurants and bars to chose from and nice clean beach to swim or just sit and relax"
DanandPao,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2015,"Great beach, you can learn to surf, they have many sun chairs, some cheaper than others, they have many beach and restaurants on the beach, great for spending the day tanning, drinking coconuts or cocktails or spending  sunset with live music, close to shops, good for surf or swim. "
Phil H,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2015,Very clean and safe and was nice to walk further up the beach to Potato Head or down to Legian and Kuta. Cheap bars to sit under shade and enjoy a drink or two
TLCWorldtraveler,california,Aug 2015,Awesome hotel !! Thanks for the upgrade ! Gee the Manager was the nicest !! We will be back for sure.
Elizabeth M,147 contributions,Aug 2015,Awesome for lounging on the sand or in a nice chair. Be sure to post up next to a chair guy with beverages those are the best guys to make friends with. They typically can also rent you a board and you can barter with them for a better deal. Sunsets our here are also spectacular. Double six is a great fun day in the sand!
Pamela M,"North Haven, Australia",Aug 2015,"top spot on the beach at Seminyak, food excellent, view fantastic. Would recommend for sunset. We caught the golf cart from the Marriot down to the beach which was great"
SUE M,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"This is one of the most amazing Hotels I have seen, just beautiful treat you like  royalty, Rooms are amzing Restaurant and Roof Top Bar great and the Plantation Grill fabulous"
Tina G,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"had lunch at the Italian restaurant, great menu and great food. Good service. Upstairs with a view of the beach and pool downstairs."
ThomasF,556 contributions,Aug 2015,"When we came the first day beach bed guys riped us off, and tried also the second day but then inknew what tonpay, they are to greedy and rud, and try to get max out you isnsted of wnating a returning client,Somhqlf price the second time, and intalkes with other clients and they also got this treatment.Found a big pice off glass in the sand just beside my bed.And a hassel all day by beach vendors, if you sleep they just pull a toe or scream in your ear to wake you up...way to much and the food placesnearby i just avarge and costly.Better go tona beach club and take a bed and buy food for the same price and get the sun bed for free"
adam,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,A lot of places to pull up and relax and watch the sunset beach is okay and quite crowded but that's why you go.
Jessica S,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,Great beach with loads of drinking and eating options on the sand. La Plancha seems like the best option with it's funky tunes and colourful beanbags but if you can't get a seat there then try any one of the lookalikes nearby. Lots of friendly beach vendors to haggle and giggle with. Double thumbs up for double six beach.
Diny T,"Dandenong, Australia",Aug 2015,Plenty of room for everyone and surf patrolled areas. Your not bothered too much by hawkers. Seems to be a safe beach to rest and play.
Naga Mas,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Had not been here for a Few years and was surprized how things change. Wel it all does, having been here in the Hippy days in the seventies...yea its different. Went from a dirt road to the beach to a full blown resort atmosphere area.         It was well known then and its well known now, gone are the little street warungs and replaced but excelent restos and also cute warungs still. Just come and explore and go see the graet sunset from here. Good place for Family friends and kids. Just as cozy place..."
linellsm,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,"good walking, but the beach could be kept cleaner.  effluent flowing over the beach to the sea is a bit confrontingl"
VonDutch1978,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"For me its a bit of a cliche now. Its nice to go down at sunset and have a beer, but there are nicer beaches in Bali."
Nipun_Parikh,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2015,A very clean beach and the sunset is just perfect. Has quiet a few nice restaurants who have live music on weekends and has good waves for surfing.  There are plenty of guys renting surf boards and ready to teach you too.  Do your bit of bargaining.
ambieis,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2014,"This is my favourite chill spot... Have a Smirnoff or Bintang at Frank's Bar (on the beach outside Jayakarta), watch the sun set and listen to the boys play the guitar and bongo's. The beach can be super crowded and you will definitely be hassled to buy things."
tony532015,"Bunbury, Australia",Jul 2015,"Fine dining in nice location, opposite the beach the water is only a stone's throw from the restaurant. Wonderful food at affordable prices "
mylovelybie_1316,"Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman",Aug 2015,a nice place to relax and get your skin dark. many place along the beach if you want to hire a long chair. and also if you want your hair to be done like bob marley:) many restaurant around too.. lunch or dinner will be perfect while you enjoy the brezzee of the sea
Ayu_wida,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2015,Love to relax on the beach while enjoying the street meat ball soup and hang out with friends. Stunning sunset would complete your day
Michael C,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,Fabulous to watch the sunset from Bar or lounge on the beach.Sitting listening to the music and watch the sun go down is surreal.
edwardorusfid,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2015,its one of a great beach in the same line with kuta beach. but its more better than because its more private. several cafe around with live music and its cool. this beach is one of option beside kuta beach in bali
babybushka,30 contributions,Aug 2015,"Great beach, loads of small stalls selling ice cold drinks and food, lot's of people selling goods which can be a hassle at times, water was pretty clean and some nice surfing as well."
gloria f,"Mandurah, Australia",May 2015,"Great hotel ,just perfect including the staff and position.Only one problem is the very noisy club next door which is owned by the same hotel.Make sure that you book a room on the other side of this night club."
Borneo-Bob,"Hernhill, UK",Aug 2015,"We always come here to enjoy the sun and sea. The beach boys are great, very friendly and look after you throughout the day. A sunbed will cost you 50,000IDR (¬£2.50) for the day and is great value. Once you get used to the various beach sellers offering watches, sunglasses, sarongs, massage etc etc its fine. Most of them are very friendly and won't pester you if you politely say ""no thank you"". The fresh  fruit and ice cream sellers are definitely a hit though."
Ben A,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,Attached to the hotel - the beach is beautiful and you can see a wonderful sunset. For hotel guests only and you can order from the bar/restaurant - a must for those seeking luxury!
SteveFawley,"Seal Beach, CA",Sep 2014,Double Six is a iconic beach in Bali. There is so much to see. Lots of good people watching. The beach can get a bit dirty with plastic trash. There are lots of street and beach sellers which get a bit bothersome and they do not take no for a answer. Double Six is a great place to go grab a beer and watch the sunset.
MICHAELJC59,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,"Such an iconic place to laze , swim eat and people watch . We spent 5 different days here .. you can barter for beach loungers for the day but never pay more than 50k for the day per chair  "
Travellor,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2015,Lots to see and do. Be prepared for hawkers selling stuff on the beach. Lots of places to eat and relax.
Geeess,"Rome, Italy",Sep 2014,There are many beaches in Bali and its best to go to one close to you to avoid traffic. This ones a great area if you stay in Seminyak and Legian as its close to both and motorbikes can you get there quickly. They are very crowded but have nice eating places and views as well.
chis2014,"Napier, New Zealand",Aug 2015,Water was lovely renting a chair with umbrella is a great idea watch out for the Hawkes they are everywhere
jo-lee j,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,Went to the roof top bar for after dinner drinks. One of the best settings in Seminyak. Staff all lovely. decor amazing. A beautiful place.
Sebastian K,"Vienna, Austria",Aug 2015,I think the beach is not only very nice but very good to start Surfing. As I think that all Schools more or less are able to teach I Chose one and had much fun.
AyuSavitri,"Guangzhou, Guangdong, China",May 2015,perfect sunset view! love it with beers we went almost everyday watching sunset from here. La Planca is my fav place 
Joy,Mauritius,Jul 2015,"A lovely big beach which has the typical characteristics of  a busy beach. On arriving it is very littered near all the vendors. Loungers are available from IDR 20 000 to IDR 50 000 depending on the season and your bargaining ability. There are a lot of surf schools and good beach to learn to surf. You can have a pedicure, massage or hair plaited by one of the ladies who come around. "
redbeachsuz,"Orewa, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Seminyak is my most favourite beach in this area.  Especially at Sunset, with a Bintang in a Bean Bag.  Bliss"
Ian J,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,"Fantastic place to spend an afternoon and watch the sun go down. Good music, good food and cold beers....awesome."
IndianinSingaland,Singapore,Jun 2015,"unlike other beaches at Kuta or Seminyak, which are overflowing with rowdy crowds and activity, this one is a calm, laid back, soft sand beach. perfect for couples wanting to soak in the magic."
Otis Noble,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,Beautiful beach that isnt quite as busy as Kuta which is a pleasant change. Still a few people barking at you to buy things but overall a beautiful sunset and lovely temperature water to walk through. 
karen201520152015,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2015,"Liked :- Good for surfing, Disliked :- Current to strong to swim in & beach touts don't leave you alone & get really annoying! "
alexandre_delasalle,"Paris, France",Jul 2015,"bali is a paradise on earth...or could be...!( and i ve been around more than 50 country in my life,)  i remenber some freind show me picture from long time beofre the first time i came to bali in the early 80' a stuning paradise this beach was., it's been a disaster since then...! the all dirty water of 1000' of hotel and restaurant from kuta to legian go directly to the beach water... it's insane!  who really want to swim in his own poo...??? i wonder why the baliness as a comunity don't take serious mesure to keep bali clean (i mean like just the minimum) please it's never too late, do something!"
Carol250342,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,"Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! Amazing , different decor. Fabulous service. Incredible food !!! Brilliant pool !!! Loved everything. Don't miss the Sensorial spa experience !"
Sjalina,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Although its more crowded than the eastern part of Bali, but its still a more convenient beach for regular beachgoers. Still a good spot to watch the sunset along the strip."
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,"This is the 'happening' beach of this island. Great for watching sunsets while enjoying an evening out. With the number of bars, restaurants and clubs here, the evening will be a lively one. In the daytime, you can enjoy the beach in peace on a deck chair or go horse back riding, learn to surf or join in some beach activity."
Colin616,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"Our hotel was just across from this beach it is great for families with a wide expanse of sand which is kept clean each morning there is a beach patrol with flags denoting safe areas to swim in the surf , there are a number of beach cafes and small bars along the beach at night the beach comes alive with live bands and you can relax on the bean bags provided and enjoy the music, great fun."
Bryan R,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,I recently stayed at a hotel close to the beach and went to the beach each day.The beach had swimming flags which a lot of swimmers swan between.The problem was that lots of surfers also kept moving into the area making it very unsafe for the swimmers due to the surf boards frequently nearly hitting the swimmers.After seeing many near misses I approached the surf life savers they said the current was pulling the surfers along the beach so there is nothing they could do. I pointed out that the flags are there for swimmer safety and the surfers should not be in the area under any circumstances and besides they had all of the rest of the beach to surf. The life savers answer was to remove the swimming flags and put up no swimming signs - not a satisfactory outcome.  For the rest of my stay (9 days) the flags were not put back out. It seems that the surfers have all the rights and to bad for swimmers.I love the Bali beaches its just a pity safety isn't taken a little more seriously but I suppose that's Bali for you.
jdb339,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,Much better beach than Kuta. Was clean and not that many hawkers. Great place to kick back and have a few Bitangs and grab some food. Nice sunset's also
Chris F,"Warragul, Australia",May 2015,Loved the waves either for just watching or for catching. The water was walk in warm.The only drawback is that the beach is not as clean as the beaches in Australia. They do sweep the beach in the morning with a tractor but following behind there is still a lot of rubbish left. The colour of the sand is quite dark.
1954Elizabeth,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2015,"Seminyak beach is very clean at the moment,  We are here in July 2015. Seminyak beach is a lovely long beach to walk along. There is always plenty happening from local soccer games, kite flying, horse riding, surfing and plenty of music. There are lots of beach restaurants and bars to choose from."
richardkesper,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,We found that this side of the beach is cleaner than Legian or Kuta...Lots less rubbish and lots less hawkers... The gay area is great for a bintang too !!!!
Annika C,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jun 2015,This time we had no rain so the beach and water was beautiful and clean.  The water temperature was a bit cool.
MelS64,"Echuca, Australia",Jun 2015,Beautiful beach with comfortable chairs and umbrella to hire. Loved having a cocktails st sunset after a day sunbathing and then finishing up with dinner in one of the quaint little restaurants right on the beach.
Lel1Perth,Perth,Jul 2015,"A great night out and excellent value with its 2 for 1 drinks offer every Tuesday. The drinks are accompanied by some very good jazz from a live band who play from 7pm to 10pm. We ordered food including sate,vietnamese spring rolls to share and every dish was good. It's was luxury at an affordable price. "
2015megs2015,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,"we are a family of 3, and it cost approx $13 AUD to hire 3 sun lounges and an umbrella for a day.  The young guys set it all up for you and keep an eye on your belongings.  As with any of the beaches in Bali, you get people coming up to you all the time offering shorts, sunglasses, manicures, massages etc.  We were there during bali school holidays, so the balinese kids are being dragged around all day by their mums, hoping that you feel sorry for the kids and buy stuff from them.  The sunsets are great.  You can hire surf boards and boogie boards and do surfing lessons as well. The surf is usually pretty good.  There are plenty of restaurants around for lunch or dinner. "
FROMManny,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,This is a new hotel and rooftop wine-bar with incredible design with  great cocktail and food options. Sip a cocktail with a view and watch the waves rolling in over Seminyak in style.
Rebecca B,"Broome, Australia",Jan 2015,Great cafes along the beach with bean bags out the front. Could easily spend a whole afternoon chilling out! 
Ramadhan Harya,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"This place is rather good in sunset time, live music, restaurant to chill for sunset is very good, i can stay until midnight sitting near beach, looking at stars and hear live music. In the day, this place is not that good, rather dirty :/ "
Nev B,Elanora,May 2015,"we love going to the beach, hiring some lounges ( Andy Bar),sitting watching the world walk by, conversing with the vendors ,we are getting to be regulars , so no real hard sell...eating fruit, reading, having a Bintang, local food from the beach......overall, just relaxing "
Ginanjarr,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Nice beach, we can use the sun bed without renting it (not like any other beach). The waves is good for surfing and there's a lot of restaurants to pick if you're hungry. Would give more stars if it's easy to find toilet and car parking lot."
BSWAustralia,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Jul 2015,This a great beach for learning to surf (lots of surf schools here). The beach has darker silica in the sand so it has a black tinge but it's really fine and soft. The water is clear and appeared clean without refuse or pollution. Importantly the beach is patrolled with uniformed competent lifeguards and no savage rip or undertow that we could see or feel so a good kids beach. Lots of deck chairs for rent if that's your thing and no hassles from hawkers with friendly locals all around. Located at the end of double six street.
Kristy L,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2015,"Nice beach spot, very popular! Great restaurants along the beach. Sun beds and umbrellas cheap to rent ($5 AUD) for as long as you want. Sand is black. Beach has a bit of rubbish from people but I've seen balinese trying to clean it, not bad though. "
RizaL Sulaeman,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,One spot in bali to have a sun tan and also have a little message on the beach. Meanwhile others surfing for the boys who enjoy surfing or just simple lying on the beach to have a sun tan.
noviam s,Indonesia,Jul 2015,nice.i enjoyed an fun. Very nice spot for drinks..watched the sunset in a cabana. The beach is clean.
The-Swain,"Dandenong, Australia",Jun 2015,It was right across the road from the hotel. Good waves for trainee surfers. There were lounges for hire and plenty of room. very popular with locals and holiday makers
John Le Raye,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Jun 2015,"A must do. Watch the sunset, then lines of planes coming in to land at Denpassar. In the distance fishing boats after a nights catch. not the cleanest of beaches, swim back at your Villa instead."
Billyhatescustard,"Newport, UK",Apr 2015,"gorgeous beach, you can even shop from your sunbed, and the sellers are friendly and will go away if you don't want to by anything. You can learn to surf, our friend did and loved it, I even had ""a go"" but not standing up!!!! Getting on it was hard enough. The sun is hot, the sea is clear and warm, and the sand is absolutely boiling so ear your flip flops down to the wet sand  or run as fast as you can. Stay under cover for your first couple of days if you are a brit- the sun burns quickly. "
Peter G,"Pacific Coast Australia, Australia",Jun 2015,"a good vibe.  the beach had an interesting mix of beach goers, restaurant patrons and kite sellers.  The beach was active all day and the sunsets were not to be missed"
Rachel L,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Nice and great place to hang out and have a walk on the beach. Can get crowded but it still has a great vibe. At sundown, head to La Plancha for some great 90's music mix and relax on the colourful bean bags and brollies with cocktails and nibbles."
Stephen O,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"Apart from the amazing view of a magnificent beach this area has a bunch of restaurants and other activities that will help you enjoy your day.   We especially liked finishing up there at the end of the day, falling into a bean bag and watching the sun go down whist we sipped on a cocktail or two.   Wonderful spot to unwind and relax."
girleen,"Portland, OR",Jun 2015,"Bali beaches still need some clean up, but this is an excellent beach to learn how to surf. Mornings are best. The waves are strong - you hardly have to paddle to catch one. I'm a novice surfer and it's one of our favorite beaches."
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"We met up with friends for sunset drinks on the beach and it was a great atmosphere with plastic chairs, umbrellas and the chilled alcohol in the eskies!"
Haikal P,53 contributions,Jul 2014,"One of my fave place to hangeout have some beer and have  some tanning ,, Nice view , i can say it the best view and the best sunset in bali , they have cafe similiar like kuta beach serving beer and goods, The famouse once is the meat ball the local called  "" bakso gerobak biru "" must try if u visit these place specialy who like meat ball beef and asian .Come at 3:00 or 4:00 pm for the best sunset ever Prefer great uv sunglasses to protect ur ayes and dont forget to bring oil tan or sunscreen cream its very hot here + easy to go by bike or car + lot of small cafe selling lot of kind of beer u need and food+ beach guard always stanby - sometime too dirty to enjoy- traffic so bad u cant move during 6-7 pm if u going by car specially weekend"
geoo1,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,"Most enjoyable evening with friends.  Food was very good, music was fun, sunset was great as usual.  Very nice spot for dinner and drinks, will certainly go back."
Missslizz,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,This place is incredible!!!! Must book a dinner on the rooftop in the booths! Food amazing! min spend $100 but very easy to do with a big group! Worth going!!!!!! you will see when you get there :)
Quinn E,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"being hassled too much by hawkers while trying to eat. La Paloma is the best on the strip, read menus well before going in "
T1NT1N,"Bondi Junction, Australia",Jun 2015,Stayed at the double six hotel beach and cafes were good sand is a little darker than other areas waves good and some flagged swimming areas along beach
Puku75,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,Very unusual and awesome venue. Loved this place. Watched the sunset in a cabana. No singlets for boys but you can buy at t-shirt for A$10 if you forget! Make sure you're there for sunset. Well worth it.
piku1980,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable."
BeachLoverNN,Singapore,Jun 2015,Everyone must go to Seminyak Beach for the most widest beach and chill-out experience.You don't have to go the expensive beach clubs to enjoy the beaches of Seminyak. Prices are reasonable.Go at 5pm is the best time to wait for the sun to set. Seminyak beach is the best experience of watching the world go by with a drink or two in hand together with loved ones.
shazmann2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"Dirty grey sand makes it visually unappealing and some places along the beach are littered with rubbish. However, the water itself is lovely and it is a perfect learner surfer beach (at least it was when we were there)."
Mimi P,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"the beach is clean, very nice sandy beach, big waves, not too crowded. you can enjoy to just walk around the beach or swimming. Also lots restaurant surrounding the beach. During sunset it very beautiful."
Lorelle L,"Korumburra, Australia",Jun 2015,"Waves at the time where bigger than what I thought they would be, not a beach for a non confident swimmer. Lots of activities going on like, fireworks, hirers of equipment, deck lounges for hire, hawkers trying to sell you stuff. Nice view "
Clive G,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"Double Six Beach is located between Legian and Seminyak. I guess about a kilometre strip of beach. During the day it is the same as any other beach but toward sunset and into the evening the place begins to buzz. There are numerous bars along the beach each offering some sort of seating, food and drinks and live music. All at inflated prices with plus plus to cap off the price. BUT if you go you are there for a sunset and balmy evening on the beach. Best advice I can give is to monitor your bill as it can too easy get out of hand. Food is at best ordinary.  If you choose to swim be aware there are quite large waves (Dumpers) which form in very shallow water. Be aware of the rips that form quickly and the odd idiot on a surf board out of control. For all that a very pleasant evening can be had here if you are carefull."
DocDanG,"Berlin, Germany",Jun 2015,During daytime it is like any other beach. But for sunset the bars but out nice chairs to enjoy a dirnk or two ;) listening to live music.
Jess K,"Nagambie, Australia",Jun 2015,"Fantastic place to spend an afternoon or sunset. Relax on a day bed for a very small price if you negotiate, have fresh coconuts and beers brought over to you, get a massage and a pedicure whilst working on your tan with friends, what more could you ask for!"
Melissa C,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Jun 2015,"This hotel surpassed all expectations. The staff were wonderful, very helpful & their uniforms were very nice. Our room was exceptional, really really nice. The shower was powerful enough to wash my hair (not too common in Bali) and the accessories (Hermes) and mini bar were very impressive. The in house Restaurants were all great and the spa was wonderful. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough."
Brooke C,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2015,Double Six is much cleaner and quieter than Seminyak Beach. You can easily spend the day there sunbaking and swimming without being hassled every five minutes. If you fancy having a go at surfing there are lots of cool people there more than happy to show you the ropes. Overall great beach only five minutes away from Seminyak. 
Kristi E,"Northern Territory, Australia",Jun 2015,"Excellent view, great service, very classy. Food was lovely. Cocktail was one of the best I had in Seminyak. Seating and tables were great for large groups or couples"
Rahuli786,"Rohtak, India",Jun 2015,"lots of local restaurants around,lot of surfing activities,visited around 8 beaches in bali found it to be best beach ,Highly recommended."
Ali B,"Joondalup, Australia",May 2015,This place is suited for couples or groups with table service provided for all drinks and food. Tapas was good and staff really helpful and friendly. Not the cheapest place but if you time it for happy hour it helps! A good night out and great view of the beach and sunset from some of the booths.
mmhsydney,sydney,Jun 2015,"Loved watching the waves and the surfers all looking for that great wave.heaps of bars along the beach where you can buy drinks and cheap food. Sand is very black and not nice to sit on without a deck chair, which can be hired for a reasonable rate"
snake43,"Victoria, Australia",May 2015,"Fantastic beach for sunset and dinner and just to relax, many restaurants on the beach and awesome music to listen to. Arrive about 5.30pm for sunset, pick a beach restaurant to sit at, jump on a bean bag, relax and enjoy the sunset and just take everything in while you are being waitered on by the friendly staff.  Most beach bar's have live music about 8pm, We felt safe to sit their till about midnight, much safer than kuta beach at night. It's about $5.00 in a taxi from Kuta or $3.00 from Legian, just ask to be taken to double 6 beach, they will drop you off at the end of the road near the cocoon club just walk across to the beach....Pure magic"
LizT55,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"Nice to look at at the different times of day and tides. Dig dumping waves often. Someone drowned one night when we were there.Black sand, very clingy. Tractors drive around each morning. And people ride horses - watch out!  Not a good beach. "
Daniel P,"Seoul, South Korea",May 2015,"Just like any other beaches around this area, the waves are quite high thus making it suitable for boogie boards and surfers. Fortunately it is cleaner in general compared to Kuta Beach where at times it can be filthy from the trashes of the tourists.I think it will be a great place to hang out if you have time to spare!"
Liachaterina,8 contributions,May 2015,"just 5 mins walk from seminyak area, jogging-friendly, and nice sunset! crowd is good, many restaurant offer food and beverage to enhance ur sunset experience."
NatB1,79 contributions,May 2015,cleaner than most beaches in Bali and close to the new double 6 hotel which has great dining and nightlife
Emma B,"Perth Hills, Australia",Jan 2015,"Of course we are spoilt for beaches in Australia, we can't compare. But the fun, cheap massages and surfing lessons is great! Still love it, great atmosphere that can't be beaten anywhere."
stephen w,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Excellent food, good wine and to top it off, free bar snacks during happy hour.  The bar on the 4th floor is over rated and tries too hard to be hip.  Go to the W or the bar at Ayana if you really want a treat.Overall"
Lourose73,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Love the fact you can lounge on a beanbag, order food and drinks, and just watch the sun go down listening to live music. Just superb. The hawkers trying to sell their wares can become annoying, but if you are firm and friendly with your ""no"", they will leave you alone"
Ian B,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2015,Beach dining was excellent and it was just amazing to walk along such a clean beach especially at sunset.
Essy G,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,This is one of my favourite beach as it very relaxed and has all the cafes with the outdoor bean bags during the evening. During the day there is day beds you can hire from many places as well as the small beach bars that sell drinks. You still get every one comign up to try and sell you anything from sunnies to ice cream but its not as full on as kuta beach.
Enlightenedlyn,"Torquay, Australia",Apr 2015,Beach had a lot of rubbish and smell there was an outlet from the street. I would not recommend swimming there.
VirginiaRoss,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,I walk down in the early morning and while this might look ok at night it's just very ordinary in the daylight. I hate nothing more in Bali than seeing signs for COLD PISS. Don't bother
Sandy B,Melbourne,May 2015,"Just great have a beer, enjoy something to eat whilst relaxing in a bean bag, listening to live music and just loving life Fantastic loved it"
Puzzo P,21 contributions,Feb 2015,"The sand is not white, but very long and wide with beautiful waves and spectacular sunset I forget the color right away. "
fudgie55,"Rockingham, Australia",May 2015,"One of the best places in the area of Seminyak a must see and experience . We have just returned and held my husbands 50th Birthday on the Rooftop bar we had a group of 20 and all our guest were impressed with not only the venue the sunset and the staff all out done themselves we booked our table from 3pm -8pm then we moved on to the VIP room one level down from the rooftop again a showcase presented room our Erving kicked on to the early hours thank you Double Six I will definitely be returning. On this holiday to Bali I visited Double Six 3X that's how much I love the venue the selection of restaurants, bars, and the whole ambience is just amazing.. A must visit travellers üëç"
gitzgitz,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2015,"If you feel lazy to go to another beach near Uluwatu to catch the sunset, then this beach is okay too. A lot of beach bar. You can swim a little also if the wave is not too big."
Courtney J,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,"Grab a beanbag chair and watch a stunning sunset. As the sun goes down, most of the bars have live music on the beach. Drinks are well-priced - we found for as low as about $2.50 beer. Lots of options for food along the strip."
Leisure93,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2015,Compared to Kuta this beach is better for a swim and surfing. Much more cleaner than Kuta beach. We enjoyed the beach.
Gerald2463,"Mangalore, India",Apr 2015,Nice beach with grey sand and blue water. Lots of food joints. Better than Kuta beach. Good place to relax have a massage on the beach while sipping on Bintang or Cocktails.
Sarah41KL,Malaysia,Apr 2015,This beach is cleaner and quieter than Kuta beach. Sand very refine and smooth but big waves when we went so we could not swim. This is also good place for surfers. Recommendable.
miztraver,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,Very dirty beach. There are also a few sewer outlets running into ocean. Would never use it. Rubish strewn all over the sand. Black sand.
hendrikh413,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Double six beach is located in Seminyak area ( Jl. Double Six ), not too far from Kuta and Legian. The beach is more interesting than Kuta Beach. Have lot of food shop and cafe nearest from The beach."
Melissa S,"Mackay, Australia",Apr 2015,Great waves for learning to surf as well as the avid surfer. The sand isn't as white as that at home in Oz but that is to be expected in a volcanos area. Plenty of cafes along the beachfront also. 
Steve c,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,Lovely large beach but grey sand.I didn't think water was as clean as could be.If going to the beach and just sun baking all day is your thing then maybe its great. 
Charlie X,NSW,Apr 2015,The Italian is worth a visit the food is the best italian I've been to around the world.Also make a point to visit the roof top the view and finger food is awesome.Tuesday & Thursday nights 2 for 1. Our next visit in Jan 2016 we will be staying here after inspecting the rooms.
Carmen L,"South Australia, Australia",Apr 2015,"Clean, I was expecting to see a lot of rubbish along the beach in the morning as per pics on the net but a tractor comes every morning (you can't even hear it) to clean anything on the beach."
Bronwyn B,Brisbane,Apr 2015,"By far the best beach in the Kuta, Legian,Seminyak region. Chairs are cheap as are the Bintangs. Always easy to get to regardless of where you are staying."
338joyce,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,Not the best Bali beach. Sand black.  Rubbish in water but they do try to clean it.  No bins around to put your own rubbish in.
Simon_Carter77,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2015,It was okay. Liked the multitude of thrown together bars on the beach. Water was warm and not many hawkers at this part of the beach.
Sheena C,"Victoria, Canada",Apr 2015,"I hear it's mostly due to the time of year but the amount of garbage was disappointing. Unless you are directly in front of a nice resort, parts of the beach were filthy. Even then, standing in the waves, a plastic bag wrapped around my leg, and I certainly watched other human debris float by. Other travellers we spoke to had similar experiences. If you are travelling between December and May, I would definitely chose a different part of Bali for beaches. The waves look lovely, but its a different story close up. "
David S,5 contributions,Apr 2015,A beautiful beach once you run the gauntlet of enthusiastic beer and sunshade vendors.Great in the evenings for younger holidaymakers with live & recorded music in several places.Very popular with surfers. Lifeguards were on duty.The only thing that spoils it a little is the bogans who leave their rubbish on the beach. You carried it down there - carry it back!!!
weeflea,australia,Apr 2015,Music on the beach at bean bag bars! Great way to start your evening. Half of Melbourne and a lot of Bali will be there!  
lonevol,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Great music and items are well priced. Great place to watch sunset. Lots of folks coming and sell items, but they are friendly bunched. Would recommend to come here if you are feeling casual."
Jo B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,Not the cleanest of beaches constant hassle from vendors but if you like that sort of thing then you will enjoy. Good for learning to surf.
Deb05213,"Kuta, Indonesia",Oct 2014,"Loved this new hotel at the end of Double 6.  Got a great package deal with Luxury Escapes and wished I had of purchased more.  Our room was divine, and the service and amenities were 6 stars.Loved the location and the swimming pool was amazing.  Restaurants in the complex were amazing and the food amazing."
Trinity S,"Island of Malta, Malta",Mar 2015,I'm not a surfer so maybe surfers would enjoy the waves but for people who just enjoy sunbathing on the sand and go for a paddle avoid this beach. It is just very dirty and unappealing.
Lisa210,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,Lovely to take a walk along the beach at sunset. Have a beer sitting on a coloured bean bag in one of the beachside restaurants.
Megan S,40 contributions,Mar 2015,"I quite liked Double Six Beach. It was a bit grubby with a bit of litter around etc but still a nice place to hang out, particularly at night. I hired an umbrella lounge for $5 and was soon approached by one of the many massage ladies who sell along the beach. They sell bracelets, sarongs, do manicures, massages, you name it, they do it. I had a great massage by a lovely older lady. She was very nice and it was a good massage. I paid about $13 Australian i guess which is probably more than the going rate for a beach massage, but i thought she was worth it. Bit annoying to have other ladies come and try to sell you things when you clearly have your eyes closed in the middle of a massage, i just tried to ignore them without being rude. Often they would go and get a little child to come back with them to see if that improved their sales tactics. If there was something i wanted to buy i would not have minded but how many sarongs and bracelets can you buy in bali??? This beach cafes etc were not really open during the lead up to Nyepi Day so we only got to go down there our last night. La Plancha was very popular with all the umbrellas and bean bags on the beach. We decided to go to the little place one up from them, i think it was called the Juice Park or something like that. Bean bags, not as busy and cheap drinks, we were very happy to hang out there and would certainly go back. Much quieter than La Plancha and we even had a foot massage on the bean bags, how cool is that. We stayed at the gorgeous Double Six Resort but next time would not waste my time drinking at their rooftop bar or their expensive pool area. At $16 for a very average cocktail i would rather drink cheap drinks on a bean bag on the beach any time. Especially with someone massaging my feet! Doesnt get any better than that in Bali! "
Nicole D,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,"A great beach with lots of little bars on it. Bean bags everywhere. Lots of balinese eager to sell there goods or a neck massage, pedicure, manicure while you enjoy a cold drink."
mick6068,27 contributions,Mar 2015,The best spot to sit on a beanbag and watch the sun go down.The peddlers were a bit too much but after a lot of saying no they finally got the message
radenayu,Bogor,Nov 2014,"You can enjoy sunsets on colorful beanbags, or take your dog here. One of the most well-known cafe at the area is La Plancha. On some nights you can also enjoy live music at several bars."
Washolovestotravel,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2015,Very disappointing.  I was told it was due to the recent tides but the amount of rubbish was incredible
JacJac2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2015,Private beach and surf was great.  Able to access the beach fast and also surf board are always avaliable
BaliBrian,"San Francisco, CA",Mar 2015,"Get an umbrella, relax and the beach boys will bring you cold drinks all day. My favourite restaurant the Zanzibar is across the street with terrific reasonably priced food (plus a toilet)..."
nevanov,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2014,"nature and party. that all you get. also there are many restaurant here. from local food to western. If you planned to enjoy sunset while drink some beers, double six will be the best place."
lynda k,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,"Hotel fantastic, wonderful food and service 5*only negative is noise from outside nightclub and noisy air con "
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,The hotel is brand new and very luxurious with fantastic balconies and one gigantic pool. It also has an bar on the beach with live music played every night.
Keggfish,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,"Back in Bali again we have been stunned by the amount of rubbish on the beaches on the Legian side of the island in the morning.  Whilst admittedly there were a couple of storms last week, the amount of rubbish washing up on the beaches should be making us all terrified about the state of the planet.  We al went fishing from Benoa and the teIl of rubbish extending miles out towards Nusa Lembongan was horrifying.  Our 15 year old grandson was most upset and it really made an impact on him.  The authorities do clean the beaches but they need more equipment and the rubbish needs to be removed.  However leaving the above aside, the beach has a good atmosphere and there are It's of little spots to sit and have a cold drink, rent a lounge, umbrella and some great little beach shacks serving great cheap food and cold drinks.  The beaches are not a patch on those we have in Western Australia, nor the water quality, but unfortunately we appear to have an unbelievable aversion to allowing people to build small restaurants, cafes and the like to service those whom wish to use the beaches, something the wonderful Balinese do not."
Drexy C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"the beach is quiet and peace, but unfortunatelly sometimes the beach become dirty when the sunset time, because the visitors sometimes tossed the garbage everywhere"
kenrick w,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Feb 2015,"more for surfing and the contact game,not really good for swimming.the dining along this beach are great. Zanzibar is great for elevated sunset drinks."
Pat B,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,"Nice beach, lots of people and kites and waves. Sun beds for rent and many cool drinks available for the thirsty traveller"
Hebbie,"Western Australia, Australia",Feb 2015,"The hawkers on the beach drove us nuts! Only went once as we went there for a peaceful swim! The hotel did take us there in their buggy, which was nice."
DebraJaneC,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,"Double six beach is a nice clean beach, good for walking etc.At night there are a few bars on the beach with bean bags to sit on which look great.The bars all have live music but I think they try and compete with each other so you can hear the music from the other bars as well so that I didn't like.Quite loud too.The sunsets are amazing so would still go."
denise H,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2015,"When we were there the beach was clean, water was great! Lots of fun in the waved!Fun atmosphere, Lounge rentals $5, bintang $2.50 - some hawkers-have to kind of ignore...fantastic sunset!! Surf lessons available"
Muru_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2015,My family and I enjoyed to be at the Double Six Beach. It is clean. Enjoy the sunset in the evening. So beautiful! In the evening there is a live music and we sit enjoy the music.
Carol-Anne E,"Hobart, Australia",Feb 2015,"Recommended to us by previous visitors to Bali. After a walk along the beach our family dined here for lunch. Whilst it appeared to be the slow season, many diners were taking advantage of this popular venue. An up market expereince with a reasonable priced menu. Service was very good, did not wait for our food for very long. Indonesian and western foods available. I had the Pasta Carbonara, very delicious and made to order. The restaurant is part of a very large accomodation complex right near the beach, visitors enjoying the pool experience as we walked through to the restaurant. We will look to stay here next time we visit"
Pancakepie,Europe,Apr 2014,"The place in Bali i saw the most of street vendors and people trying to sell you something.I have never said ""No Thank You"" in one place more than i did in Double SixBut after 8 pm it gets bit quieter and pretty chill actually. Cocktails are good (especially the ones served inside of a coconut - sometimes you have to tell them to serve your cocktail in a coconut and for extra 0.5 AUD thy will do it)But for my taste (when i was there while the sun was still up) double six is not a nice place to have a chilled drink with your misses. Extremely touristic and allot of people under 20 away from home who had more drinks that they could actually handleTake a scooter and some time and go to Balian beach instead. Cheers"
CDN_GUY_40,"Raleigh, NC",Feb 2015,"The beach has dark sand and very popular with locals and tourists. It was a great place to relax and work on your tan. There are many plsces to rent chairs, order food and drinks.Local ladies will come and offer spa services right at your chair. Not as busy as Kuta Beach but just as nice!"
Dianne980,"Evans Head, Australia",Feb 2015,"The beach is a great position , the food is good,  drinks are cold and a little shopping while there."
Roni G,"Darwin, Australia",Feb 2015,"Double Six Beach is the last part of the good beaches between Kuta and Seminyak. The further you go towards Seminyak from hear the beaches are crap. This beach still has all that the Legian beach has to offer but a bit more secluded. There are restaurants on offer with the usual coloured bean bags on offer, it has a trendy party feel with different restaurants to choose from, some on the beach and some over the road behind the beach. Everything is close by...."
Colin B,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2015,"My travel partner and I had opposing views about Double Six Beach. I had been disappointed by Seminyak beach just farther north of this one, whereas he had liked Seminyak's ambience. I liked Double Six's feel and nearby places, but he found them less desirable. Beaches are such a subjective thing, but I quite liked this one, as Bali's beaches in this area go. None of them were great compared with the beaches down to the south end, e.g. Nusa Dua."
FassoMark,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,"The beach is filthy the water smelled of sewerage after the rain!litter all over the beach from drains,"
Chrisinasia,Asia,Feb 2015,Nothing to compare with the old time 66 beach. Still comfy and a great place to watch the sunset. Bars now are quite pricey and vendors pushy...
Donna B,"Greater Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,Unfortunately the beach front in Seminyak is not that clean and the volcanic sand doesn't add much!  Great  to take a morning walk along though!
Robert G,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,"Each morning after breakfast, my wife and I took a walk on this lovely beach. Warm water, clean beach and great views!"
SamChopra,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2014,There are loads of restaurants and hotels by the side of this beach. Easily accessible. Better to take a cab. You will find many shacks on the beach also. The all serve alcohol. Its a busy beach.
Alan W,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2014,Lots of different Beach Restaurant's and at night many of these have live bands. Sitting on the beach at night on beanbags drinking cocktails and listening to live music.
James P,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Very clean near our hotel and hotel umbrellas for our use. Never too busy and close to cafes and restaurants 
Daninsydney2065,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"Good music, great views, awesome location. Amazing for the younger set, (music) but still very enjoyable"
Paula M,Figtree,Feb 2015,"This is a magical place to chill out on the beach as the sunsets. Grab a beanbag at any of the cafes along the beach, grab a drink and listen to the music. Watch all of the action as the sun sets. Bliss"
missscoward,"Wolverhampton, UK",Feb 2015,"Not the greatest beach I have been to, I understand the currant was bring a lot of litter onto the beach which was a shame."
Paul R,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Sunsets were great and the music from the local cafes was always upbeat and modern. Nice to see people happy and enjoying themselves.
uktraveler2015,Singapore,Feb 2015,It had such warm water it was like walking in a bath. The only bad thing was the hassle from the beach vendors but once you'd said you didn't want anything a couple of times they left you alone.
Beach Bum B,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"This is an extraordinary beach from Apr-Dec when the current runs west from Bali; flat, clean and welcoming.Mid Dec-March the current flows from Java and Sumatra towards Bali and the beach is loaded with anything and everything you can imagine; not a nice place to play.They try to clean it but seem to fail more than succeed!The west coast from the airport to Canggu is pretty much all the same at this time~~~Indonesia needs to work on Environmental awareness or tourists will stop coming during those months.Today, 4 Feb, the beach was a mess.Beach Bum Bill"
Nadia S,9 contributions,Jan 2015,"Compare to Kuta beach, this beach has one of the most beautiful sunset... I am sure will go back there..."
Genevieve A,59 contributions,Aug 2014,"Beach and surf great and restaurants very good especially ""Sea Side"" We got lounges and umbrellas on the beach very cheap and it was good they had the flags to swim between for safety. The beach is kept very clean and ""Ari"" looked after us each day with a good price for lounges. The Ice Cream boys were great on the beach especially ""Echo"" and Frankie."
BeatBop66,"Tiwi Islands, Australia",Jan 2015,"Amazing view on the balcony, sitting in the sunken lounges surrounded by water, over looking Legion Beach, sipping delicious cocktails. Sweet and attentive staff."
Sam9922,"Medellin, Colombia",Jan 2015,"Plenty of vendors trying to sell you things. Not so clean, Much better other beaches further towards Cangu"
Simon R,Glenside,Jan 2015,"We spent last visit at this beach and found it a refreshing change from Seminyak Beach. The beach vendors are very friendly, check out the candlit beach bag sing fest from around 7 everynight. Check it out on your next visit. "
Olivier B,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Oct 2014,"Ask for Kani he will teach you how to surf in 2 hours.around 5pm, they start playing football, you know the game with ball and your foot."
Jane,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2015,"watched 2 awesome sunsets at this beach, clean and well maintained.  A relaxing way to spend the day or evening."
LagsFamily,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2015,"Some nice bars and cafes but spoilt by all the rubbish washed up on the beach. It was a shame to see so much human rubbish along the beach including syringes, plastic bags etc. Not a safe place for kids to play."
VTik,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2015,"Pro :- Nice beach with ocean view.  Good view for sunset.- Lots of cafe, restaurants and bars fronting the beachside.Con:- Extremely dirty beach during the monsoon season (Dec/Jan) when the rubbish from the rivers got washed to the beachside."
Lawrence H,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,"The amount of plastic , logs , bottles that was floating in the water was very bad and disappointing very very dirty. "
Dolphindream,"Byron Bay, Australia",Oct 2014,Just too many sellers on the Beach - not so Clean - but if your YOUNG and Looking for a DAY VIBE - lots of Day Beds on the Beach to meet others very Social - but I don't like the Vibes for Families with Kids - Too hectic - didn't feel comfortable leaving Stuff on the Beach to go Swimming - Like a Mini Kuta
karthickn123,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Good beach, but need cleanness.Got lots of cafe, bars and beds to hire. Great for kids and viewing sunset. Water is bit warm and bit tides for surfers."
Kimkortekaas,Bali,Sep 2014,"Double Six Beach is okay. I think its a nice beach if you want to learn surfing because most of the time the ocean is very wild. It's not a good beach to go to with young children because swimming is a bit dangerous. If you are going with friends, reading a book or you just want to sunbathe it's fine to go here.  "
freedomwheels289,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"stayed over the road ,so many great little bars and food places from all kinds of taste,great beach bars and music every night just got love it here!"
Ika P,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"One of my fave beachto watch the sun goes down.Though you maybe have to avoid to come here in weekends, very very crowded.And looking for parking spots is another problems that you will faced."
Kezzas27,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Bean bags on the beach with a cocktail and watch the sun go down. where in the world can you do that. This is a great way to spend the early evening and watch the sunset. Service is a wee slow but worth the wait. There a few to choose from along the beach front.Cheers
charly1684,"Krefeld, Germany",Jan 2015,Compared to last year (2014) this beach has strongly deteriorated. Unfortunately there's rubbish all over the beach and it is not a pleasure any more to stay there. Let's help the local people by showing more responsibility and keeping the beach clean.
josiewolff,3 contributions,Dec 2014,We had the best Christmas Day lunch ever at the Penthouse Restaurant (top Floor). the food was fantastic as well as the service and the view was incredible.
R0sie1,"Lombok, Indonesia",Dec 2014,Fantastic bar and restaurant right in the beach . The best NEw years eve ever! Inexpensive . Fantastic staff and loads of fun.
Shane Zieck,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"This beach/road has been a destination for beach goers and night clubbers since the 1970s'. I have been there so many times I have lost count. Recently the clubs have returned to their glory days and are a lot of fun. Not the place for a quiet getaway, rather one of the hubs of daytime and night-time action. Leave it to you to decide..."
TravellerTeale,7 contributions,Dec 2014,"The sand looked brown and dirty and rubbish was all over the place. However, the restaurants along the beach looked nice."
Phase N,7 contributions,Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are are awful. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourist come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are pristine paradise.p so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc.  I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer.  This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built  over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person.  All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.   These bars also seem to be populated with pretentious people staring at their smart devices and taking selfies particularly 'la  Plancha'.  You're better off buying some bin tangs and go further up where there are no bars and enjoy the sunset on a towel with some quiet."
Jayne I,"Dongara, Australia",Dec 2014,"The Rooftop at the new Double Six Seminyak is the ultimate In rooftop bars. Views, service, the kids cinema section,  layout and design tick all the boxes. "
Giboos,Western Australia,Dec 2014,"My husband and I met up with some friends of ours for a night at the Double Six Rooftop Bar.What struck me was that we were asked before being advised of directions to where the bar was located what our names were, as though there was a door list (which there was not) and the bar was barely half full.The cocktails are super expensive and are no where near as good as others I have tried, Potato Head's cocktail list is much more extensive and better executed.The clincher was the food....My husband and I ordered the ""Big A$% Bucked of Chicken Wings"" which mentioned on the menu that it would be enough for 3 people at least - we are NOT huge eaters and what we received was a ""Big A$% Bucked of White Rice"" with some chicken wings on top - this was not good enough in my opinion.Service was slow - the waitress had to be chased down at times so we could order.I can see what type of ambiance that is being attempted here at the Double Six Roof Top bar but it is not been executed well at all.Food and beverage needs some work and service needs tidying up.Also nothing is more off putting that trying to fake elitism with pretending to have a door list when one does not exist - people don't want to put up with this kind of pretentious rubbish when they are on holidays - in fact no one should have to put up with it ever.Sorry to say but we are heading back to Bali in 2 days time and I don't plan on returning to Double Six at all - there are great little bars along the beach with plenty of local people who are friendly, welcoming provide great food and beverages at a reasonable price and certainly don't have door lists.... steer clear "
Dalla11,"Middle Dural, Australia",Dec 2014,This is a fantastic hotel. The staff are lovely and always have a smile for you. We had Christmas eve dinner in the new plantation restaurant and had a fabulous time. Then Christmas lunch in the Italian restaurant was once again great. Spa centre is amazing. Rooms are great. And kept emaculate  the manager is exstreamly welcoming and doing a great job. We can't say anything negative about this hotel
asri testiana m,22 contributions,Nov 2014,"This beach is so comfortable, amazing sunset view, love the local food, and the people is so friendly. Best place to spend the day at the beach with view budget. "
Koula D,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,A beautiful beach spot with all you could ask for in the way of eatery's..sit back and enjoy the Bali sunshine..Great mix of people..very relaxed indeed 
MerryMegsy,"Lara, Australia",Nov 2014,"As with Seimyak and Legian beach, the best time of day for double six beach is sunset.There are loads of little makeshift bars with locals selling beers. Possibly a bit less refined than Seminyak beach where you can sit in a restaurant/cafe and watch the sunset, double six is more for hanging with the locals, grabbing a beer and sitting on a deck chair or bean bag.Tends to be more Aussies here and it maybe a bit more laid back."
Finda Ayu,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2014,"My fave closest beach from kuta. Left side from entrance road is great for breakfast, there are a lot of restaurants serving nice and affordable breakfast. In the evening, the right side will be filled up with bean bags on the beach. You can enjoy the sunset while live music been played. Nice!"
Lynley T,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2014,"As an Aussie, I deem it my responsibility to go to one, or more Bali beaches for a Bintang and watch the sunset each trip.  On this occasion, I had guests staying with me at my Villa and I had assured them this should be ticked off their bucket list!   As always, several ""Beer boys"" descended upon us and I ordered 3 chilled beers, as we were ushered to some rather old and grubby looking laybacks.   As they were uncomfortable on our backs, we requested chairs.  Anyway, the beer was chilled to perfection.  As the beers were delivered I was advised that it would cost each of us IDR to sit on these chairs, about which I was most embarrassed in front of my friends.  I paid the bill when we left and added IDR for the uncomfortable laybacks, making it perfectly clear that such demands are damaging the image of 66 Beach and people will go elsewhere for their beers.On top of that, Taxi's were asking IDR100,000 to transfer back to Seminyak because of 66 being 1-way!    I said we would use the meter, and received the normal response ""meter broken"".   Who is going to tidy up this place and take it back to the happy and fun place to have a beer & watch the sunset??   I'll go back then."
whitejen,singapore,Sep 2014,Double Six Beach is good for swimming. It is not big waves and love cafes for drink during sunset. But i don't like when it too touristic. 
rsalas06,"Spring, TX",Dec 2014,"Black sand beach that could be nice if the trash, dogs and vendors were not everywhere. Our first day in Bali and we went down to the beach to let the kids play. I sat just to relax and couldn't do that because I was interrupted by a vendor every few minutes to buy something. There are tons of stray dogs and lots of trash probably coming up from Jakarta. "
diane cunningham,Edinburgh,Dec 2014,We wanted to sit and watch the sunset but there was rubbish music blaring out of speakers most of the way along the beach. Then we found a nicer place and sat on bean bags and watched the world go by and it was very entertaining with Hindu dancers to football games to kite sellers and the usual sarong ladies. Fine for one night but I'd hate it if it was every night. Taxi drivers try to charge a fortune to get back to our resort but you just have to keep trying till you get one that's fair price.
kingauto,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"Brilliant location if you can afford the outside rotunda.Great atmosphere, food and beverages pricey but well worth it for a night out."
GinaT99,"Whangarei, New Zealand",Dec 2014,"The beach is really dirty. There is rubbish everywhere, bottles, broken glass etc. There is some attempt to clean in front of some hotels but the rubbish comes down open streams onto the beach and is everywhere. I would not swim there although the water is warm and there were a number of surfers out everyday. Sad as it is a long attractive beach but would not stay there again for the beach."
Cooker850,"Fremantle, Australia",Dec 2014,"Went here at about 4.30 to relax and watch the sunset. Unfortunately the weather did not allow us to do that, the skyline however was still pretty special. Bit hard to complain about a fairly neat beach, beanbags on the sand, music, cold drinks and a general happy atmosphere without being harrassed by vendors like at Kuta beach. Ended up moving into Capil bar when the rain started..live music..interactive..enjoyed it very much. "
Irma S,7 contributions,Nov 2014,The beach definitely better than kuta beach. It is well maintained and lots of restaurant around the beach area. You can seat at the relaxing bean bag and order a very cold beer. Enjoy the view without too much people around you.
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Long walks on a clean, organised beach.  Beach hawkers but not pushy at all.  Plenty of choice for bars and/or restaurants all along the beach"
Alilen,"Damascus, Oregon",Nov 2014,"Warm gorgeous blue water. Shallow a long way out. While not the worst we've seen in our travels it is sad to see such a lovely beach with so much plastic and litter. ""Hawkers"" selling trinkets, ice cream, fruit etc were overall friendly. If you were not interested a simple but firm ""no thank you"" was sufficient. On average about 50,000 reps for beach chairs for 2 for two people the day. "
Kelvin C,128 contributions,Dec 2013,"I really liked the Cocktails plus the cool night breeze but would not go to that area in the day , it is too hot and crowded then . For the Afternoon I recommend Sanur ."
Suzie O,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2014,"This beach has lots of live music that starts around 6pm so,you,can drink..eat and watch the sunset."
138JoeS,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,not too much hawking. Plenty of beach side cafes   Like the bean bag dining.   Dry close to our hotel and walking distance to Gado Gado restaurant. Close to a wide choice of places to eat.  
mibial,"London, UK",Aug 2014,Pick your spot very carefully as distinct smell of sewage on parts of the beach! Whilst we were there it was extremely windy with HUGE waves so large parts of the water were out of bounds...a bit disappointing.
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Nov 2014,This is a really nice place to watch the sunset and have a drink while watching. Many places have nice music and a great atmosphere.
rayj1011,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"the roof top bar is spectacular and if only for this you should visit the double six but i would recommended you visit the seminyak italian food restaurant as well. the food , sevice and wines are great. the setting is relaxing overlooking the pool so do go "
monalizzahl,The Netherlands,Apr 2014,beautiful stunning sunset <3 lots of cafe with good price. can relaxing have a drink or two while watching the sunset... what a beautiful life :)Double Six Beach is not really crowded and busy compare to Kuta Beach.
SoloSenior48,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2014,Great place to chill at the end of the day with friends or alone sipping a beer and watching the glorious sunsets.  The guys who run the little bars are very friendly and love to stop for a chat.  Great atmosphere
E113N,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Nov 2014,"It is not the best beach in Bali, but it is quite nice to see sunset here. Lots of restaurants and cafes around."
Fauzia B,"Depok, Indonesia",Oct 2014,"The beach is not so crowded, not so many sales woman/man who force us to buy their things. The cafe's are colorful, I love the umbrellas and the lazy beach cushions to sit comfortably. It's a perfect spot to spend times watching sunset while drinking juices or beers (with not so expensive prices).. So relaxing."
JulieD2011,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,Freshly made in house pasta. Tuna was fantastic. Prices were reasonable for the quality and service. Drink prices were reasonable and the choices huge.
spotswood2014,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Good beach,  with warungs on sand.  Bean bag sunsets with cocktails,  very relaxing.  Capil Beach hut,  great iced coffees and rum and cokes..."
Hollioccky,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,Great stall shopping. Great Italian pizza restaurant opposite double six cafe too. Some stall owners were a little too pushy when just browsing
tony h,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"What better way to watch the sun go down then having a few drinks at the beach, the part of Bali i love the most"
Debra W,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,It is located right on the beach and is the sister resort to The Breezes so you can also access the resort and go in a golf buggy.
mizztic,"Moscow, Russia",Apr 2014,"Hot sun, big waves, relax, surf if you want, coconuts, massage, etc. Great fun with Acong's team! We miss you, guys!"
mcnairn2014,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Oct 2014,"Beautiful hotel. Beautiful people. Service outstandingWhat is disappointing is when you look beyond the facade, you notice that the bottom of the showers and toilets have cracked tiles, where dirt piles up. Hard to believe this place has only been open a few months - already looked quite tired in places."
Jan P,"Darwin, Australia",Aug 2014,"We spent most afternoons on hired beach chairs until the sun went down, the breeze is so refreshing, its great to give the samll beach chair owners business, and you can purchase ice cold Bintangs for 20,000 each brought to you, tell you will be back and make sure the Bintangs are ice.  Relax and have fun with the Beach hawkers dont take it too seriously."
SamWeinstein,"Mosman Park, Australia",Sep 2014,This beach and the Ocean are extremely clean. The rip is not to bad and the waves are usually manageable but also big enough to learn to sure or have an ok fun surf. It is patrolled by trained lifeguards and has sweet ladies to massage you for about R50.000 to R80.000 of course they will ask much more. We like to rent the little lounges with umbrella's and then eat across from the Beach at The Blue Ocean Cafe where my fav is the Blue Ocean Salad and the pasta dishes but the seafood is also fantastic. We sit inside at the elevated lounges. It also has a little shower to wash the sand off.
GSewell85,Birmingham,Oct 2014,"It depends on what you're into but we got the shock of our lives when we arrived in Bali. We expected, quiet, idyllic And picturesque, instead we got busy, bustling and quite dirty! If you're a surfer, rasta or hippy this might be the beach for you, it's extremely crowded, with vendors, bean bags, surf schools, reggae bars, etc etc. However if you want some peace and quiet with calm seas go for the beach at Sanur which is thirty minute cab ride from double six."
avidtraveller,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2014,"Don't expect pristine sand - it is very dark grey and gritty walking along....also lots of sand in the waves on the water's edge. The water however looks stunning from the beach, the breeze is lovely and glorious sunsets.There are lots of dogs on the beach in the early a.m. - we are assuming with dog walkers - they often have four or five beautifully kept dogs in tow."
RichardConnery,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2013,"Don't forget your surfboard and relax with an ""on the beach"" massage between sets. Step up into one of the numerous hotels with direct beach access for a coffee or bite of lunch."
Snoopras,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Double six had great reviews but we found it a little lacking particularly in the bed availability around the pool - a struggle every day, the music late at night and the breakfast service."
Tracey H,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Oct 2014,Tried surfing for my first time with Wayan Tembok.  Super fun.  Genuine nice guy. He also apparently works as a tour guide.
Jadeyp91,"Carrum Downs, Australia",Sep 2014,"I have been married on part of the double six beach near the Jayakarta and learnt to surf on another part near the padama! love the clean water and the locals are great as well! Love that I can shop from my seat, it can be a bit hard getting some of the sellers to accept no as answer but overall I rate it highly!"
Tony_mc27,"Liverpool, UK",Sep 2014,"My wife and I had a half day beginners surfing lesson here after travelling from Ubud for the day. The beach was clean and had a plentiful selection of bars and restaurants.Yes there are hawkers and yes they are a pain, but this is common on every beach across Asia that I have been to. I found as long as you said no and were polite they would leave you alone. The waves were great for learning to surf and as long as you follow the rules of the flags it is a safe place to swim"
gurugheryl,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2014,"Current music, sunset, Bintangs in bean bags without the ++. Surf was quite huge as we watched the surfers."
LouFran76,"Wodonga, Australia",Jul 2014,"Definitely better beaches for a swim down south.  An example of why most villas have pools.  If still undecided on going for a swim, take an early morning stroll along the beach and see the rubbish washed up!"
RodSutt,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"We have three kids under 5 and this beach is perfect. Heaps of sand, a little bit of white wash and plenty of food options. The new Double Six hotel also looks nice, we ate at Cocoon and the food was great."
Susan R,6 contributions,Sep 2014,Double Six is one of the nicer sections of Seminyak Beach.  Great water play for little kids with loads of beach to play on.  Surfing great for older kids.   Grab yourself a banana loiunge or beanbag and spend the afternoon there - you will have to order drinks and food to stay on the furniture but believe me you will want to.  Stay for the sunset and listen to the live music whilst waves are crashing - what a better way to spend a casual evening.
mjw_au,"Brighton, Australia",Aug 2014,Surf too big to swim on 1 day but ok the other. many service providers to rent surfboard hie - prices vary but quite cheap
rosemaryVenusBay,Venus Bay,Sep 2014,"This place is supposedly renowned for it's pasta dishes - over our stay, we had three different pasta meals, and all of them were quite ordinary.  However, the raw tuna with pomegranate, and the delicious calamari entres were excellent.  Service good."
JamesSharpe,"London, UK",Sep 2014,"Its a real let down to find such an idyllic setting ruined by litter, raw sewage and soiled nappies / sanitary products.  I know this is a developing country, but the local authority would do better to clean the beach overnight. On the plus side, plenty of loungers and bars to rest at, Bali Joes, is fun and beer is cheap and cold!"
Susan W,Kuta,Aug 2014,Recently I visited double six beach and very surprised to see it's very crowded.So many new caf√©s / restaurants and equipped with bean bag on the sand.Quite relaxing and fairly economical if you like to sip your coconut or something stronger while watching sun set. The view is nice and nobody will bother you if you stay a bit long with only one drink.
Belinda B,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2014,"Loved this beach, even the beach sellers are gorgeous people.Mer many a swim buddy, shared many stories and Bintangs, sunset memories"
Zimmer1973,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"This was a fantastic experience, as soon as you walk along the path you can hear the house music, smell thew food in the air and as soon as you are there with the drinks and the beach it is a buzz, the vibe is party and you will feel it straight away"
ltanudib,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2014,The beach is crowded. Lots of drinking place nearby. much like the kuta beach. Suggest to go here by taxi as walking from seminyak without knowing the way will be a long long walk. 
NararaToni,Narara,Aug 2014,My favourite time here is in the late afternoon and evening with the lovely lit umbrellas and the beanbags. Sit and sip your cocktail and enjoy the live music on the beach. Totally relax with a foot massage as well. Sunbaking and surfing is over rated!
MartinC4,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Aug 2014,Meal was tasty and service good.  The pasta was slightly undercooked but overall the meal was very enjoyable.
siamsabu2014,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,Nothing really to dislike here..you can take a leisurely stroll and find a very affordable place to eat along here..having a meal while sitting on the beach in bean bags is the way to go..
brightl,Victoria,Aug 2014,"Safe, magnificent waves, friendly, lots of eating places on beach, Bintang in a bean bag watching the world go by! Or watching planes arrive  and depart"
Jodi78,Gold Coast,Jul 2014,"I always stay here every trip, much cleaner than it used to be and no whee near as many dogs. Service offered here with beach lounge rentals is always great and happy to help you. Can't go past sunset drinks here. "
Nicole L,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Feb 2014,the sea is full of rubbish. but my first surfing experience was great! around 15 mins walk from my hotel. 
Roger F,"Tiburon, CA",Aug 2014,"Thinking of taking a surf class here which would be cool, as waves are plentiful and fast but not immense. But this isn't a beach you go to for sheer beauty. Sand not great and some trash about. Seminyak beach not beautiful either but wider and some nice chill caf√©s with music, right on the sand. Looks best at night. "
Regina W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Great place for Sunset drinks and watch an amazing sunset ,especially from the roof top.A little more pricey than on the beach,but a must do whilst in Seminyak "
leaguegirl,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Aug 2014,"The lifeguards here are very friendly and there's no shortage of sarongs and beads to buy from the hawker ladies (can get a bit overwhelming at times), beach chairs for hire and cold beer for sale, if you want it (I didn't).The beach itself is pretty ordinary when compared with say Langkawi or Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia. It's a bit grubby and there's way too many people. You will be hassled to buy sarongs and beads. Luckily the ladies are nice, but they are persistent."
Oli422,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,Enjoyed morning walks and hanging out watching spectacular sunsets with great music from surrounding warungs.
chelsren18,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2014,Picture perfect with lots of day beds to hire and perfect sunsets. Alot cleaner than Seminyak beach.
Edmond C,"Bellagio, Italy",Aug 2014,"Lovely beach but remember to negotiate for the umbrella and seats.  Prices could varies up to 100,000Rp."
J S,23 contributions,Aug 2014,"I learned surfing here on baby boards. A lot of fun, although it has little to do with real green wave surfing."
Isabel C,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2014,It's a wide sandy beach and the waves are great for surfing! We rented a tent and loungers and spent the morning relaxing and watching all the various beach activities.
Andrew G,"Brooklyn, New York, United States",Jul 2014,"Not a quiet place, but it's an amazing setting. We stayed in more laid-back Sanur, but traveled the 20 minutes to double-six to take surfing lessons (at Rip Curl -- awesome place!).  There's a bit of traffic and lots of folks on the beach in July/August, but the weather and the waves were great.  Lots of places to get out of the sun and get a drink, too.  This beach reminds us of some of the places in Thailand, but it's actually cleaners and the waves are much better (for surfing)."
Kirmatt,"Mansfield, Australia",Jul 2014,A very relaxed atmosphere to sit in a bean bag and enjoy the sunset while sipping on a cocktail.. :)
BenMiz,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2014,"When the swell and tides are right double six has a really nice little beach break. The last 3 days of our stay I manged to get my 5 and 7 year olds standing up and surfing in the perfectly sized kid friendly waves. It's not always like this however and small kids under 5 should be watched at all times. The beach itself is your typical volcanic sand, it was relatively clean and there are some nice little restaurants that you can dine at, sitting in bean bags dining at sunset on the beach was great. I had some nice service of Mahi Mahi there washed down with a few cold Bins you couldn't go wrong. "
saverioca,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"I like the warung (little restaurants on the beach) but since five years ago waves of concrets are destroyng part of the beach with new ""luxury"" hotels ...but the atmospere is still nice and you can walk in the afternoon looking for the wonderful incredible everyday sunset ."
joe036,perth,Aug 2014,"Well, This amazing restaurant is set within an amazing hotel. The hotel is awesome enough but wait till you taste the food. I had the squid ink tagliatelle which I swapped for what was originally served with rice, The flavours were amazing. The starter was a bruschetta, traditional and perfect. Do yourselves a favour and try this place foe a reasonable price."
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2014,Even if surfing isn't your thing...head down jalan double six until you hit the beach. I prefer the area to the right of that intersection. Now hang around until after sunset. Many of the beach cafes bring out bean bags for you to slide into and watch the magic. Its a photographers dream. |This is an ideal place to learn to surf as well.
adit3005,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2014,"Like - Nice sand and strong waves for an interesting swim.  Nice bars with live music in the evening on makeshift stagesDislike - Constant touts for foot massage, drinks, fruits and trinkets.  Could do with half of the number of requests "
Jacaydan,"Moranbah, Australia",Jul 2014,"Our children did surfing lessons on double 6 beach with one of the local surfing groups. I highly recommend this experience.  There is a strong current in some places, but the surf instructors are very helpful reminding people where the best places are. (They looked a bit intimidating when we first met them, but they were lovely and incredibly helpful). The sand is black sand rather than golden, so it looks dirty... but you get used to the look. There seem to be a lot of dogs roaming along the beach, but they were well behaved. I definately recommend purchasing a cocktail or  Bintang from one of the beach front eateries, hiring a chair / umbrella and sitting back to watch the surfers and the sunset."
Scott F,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,Double Six is covered with beach umbrellas and full of holiday makers.  The water can have a strong undertow but it has a gentle sandy bottom.
Nocky-1961,"Margaret River, Australia",Jul 2014,"Looks Dirty compared to Kuta Beach and some sleazy characters hanging around, eating places look ok but the rest is a let down, not for us"
Penelope3110,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"So many tourists are fascinated by the famous Double Six Beach and is called ""five star beach"" but seriously, the place is completely packed with tourists, and domestic tourists. The domestic tourists makes you feel so uncomfortable cause all they do is stand in front of you and take photos or videos of you sun bathing or running. And not just one person does this, it's a whole group of men! There are so many other great beaches on Bali! "
Monica A,2 contributions,Jul 2014,"I liked that there are a number of restaurants along the shore, where we could have a few snacks and drinks.Hotel Horison (our hotel) has a designated lounge area here, which was good for us. It's a quick 5-minute walk from our hotel.What I didn't like was that there were so much plastic garbage (food packaging) in the water. I lost interest in swimming. I wish government invests in coastal clean-up so tourists can appreciate the beach more."
Veronica H,"Perth, Australia",May 2014,"Best meals while over the ocean, such a variety to choose from.loved them all tried all restaurant s , "
Michelle19682014,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"Visited this beach a few times... deck chairs always available to hire for 50,000 rupiah for 2 ($AUD5) and plenty of fully racked eskys to purchase a cold Bintang! Surfboard hire was popular with the kids and great value for money - just check the board thoroughly beforehand as you will have to pay for any damage such as lost fins etc. Though too many hawkers, the women attack you from all ends - hair, nails, adorning your body with jewellery - so much so you don't know what you have/haven't paid for - and they get grumpy if you don't buy from them at all - be stern when saying NO! Pity there were no set up for massages on the beach - you can get one but you have to ask until a random lady drops her bundle and offers - you can probably get better and cheaper elsewhere but if that's what you need at the time then... Late afternoon sees the beach converted with bean bags for cocktails and sunset watching, gets quite busy but the scene looks great!"
hickles74,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2014,"Cheap, lots of activity going on and cocktails a few hundred metres from the ocean's edge at sunset - worth a visit."
daCoach420,"Boracay, Philippines",Jun 2014,Double Six is one of those laid back beaches with a surfer culture vibe. Nice little restaurants and bars dot the beach front and there are surf schools everywhere. It's just more upscale and less crowded than the beaches of Kuta or Legian.
Aussa2012,"Richmond, Canada",May 2014,"They are a loud pub like place, fun to watch a game but the food is only ok. My partner and I both had a burger and it was alright. They had delicious onion rings but the portion was really small for a side order."
Omri B,"Paris, France",Apr 2014,the beach is becoming more and more dirty. Atmosphere is not what it used to be. I don't go there anymore.
adrian_stevens98,"Riga, Latvia",Jan 2014,"Great location, not many people. Love the food and bean bag bars. The drinks come in the most awesome cups."
nogenmania,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2014,Beach was quite crowded when it comes to sunset. Very beautiful. love it! Perfect for sunbathing or just relaxing enjoy the view.
SunSeeker S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,"Double six is a great beach to relax and watch the sunset.There are many bars and restaurants on the beach to chill out in, relax and listen to music.Double six is less hectic than Kuta beach and many Balinese come here to socialise.Nice way to spend an evening, drink a cold beer, eat pizza......without breaking the bank."
Adele R,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,Andy  is wonderful.  Very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  Very cheap hire of sun lounges for the day.  $2.50 or can sit on the bean bags and watch the sunset while having a Bintang or Smirnoff.  
chrisraywhitebali,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2014,"Great beach for sunset, relaxing and less touristy like Kuta beach.Could spend every day there if only they had wifi so I could work!"
frizi1,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2014,"Sunset and Bakso (meatball soup), sitting on a comfortable beanbag with a loved one... Nice!!!! Very crowded on a Sunday after 4 pm so they may run out of soup by 7 pm or hard to find a seat unless you share a coffee table with others."
angiegala24,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"We sat on the chairs here on  two occasions during our stay in Bali.   We were actually staying closer to Potato Head but found the beach calmer and the life guards more alert in this area.  The people hiring the chairs out were nicer- and didn't keep on asking when are you leaving.  We paid $5 and stayed here to watch the sunset on one occasion.  The massages were cheaper here and you could also buy any type of fruit- pineapple, mango, dragonfruit, mangosteen etc etc.   you could buy beer, sprite and chilli butter corn.   The people selling bracelets, sarongs etc were friendlier and not overly pushy.  I did a lot of my sarong and bracelet shopping here.  The atmosphere was GREAT and FRIENDLY."
markymark40,18 contributions,May 2014,Plenty of places to sit on the beach and watch the sun set.breathtaking views plenty of familys and couples a must see 
Hazcom,10 contributions,Mar 2014,"great place to catch up with expats from all over , great feel with familiar people great information found here on what to do and what to watch out for!!"
Bali777,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2014,"We have travelled to Bali every year for about the last 15 years in March/ April. Sitting on the beach with a cocktail or beer, listening to the waves break & watching the sunset was romantic & relaxing  before strolling to one of the beach side restaurants for dinner. Sadly our sunset  experience this year was totally ruined by by the absolutely  deafening Afro American music blaring out from Double Six making it impossible to talk to one another let alone hear the waves. We had to walk a fair way to find a restaurant along the beachfront where the thumping music did not intrude. We are not against the  music per se but the volume should be kept within reasonable levels so that everyone can appreciate whatever they have come for. Happy hour by the pool with duh duh duh music is fine for those who enjoy it but it should not be so overly invasive & spoil the evening for more peaceful beach  sunset lovers.   The sunset magic has been lost.......we won't be back."
PeggyPesik,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"I love this beach!I go to Double Six beach almost every day ^_^I like the wonderful sunset view, lovely people from all countries, and lots of bar."
Jacki B,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2014,Great  place to watch the sunset pre dinner.  Live music - great cocktails!!.  The Bean Bags come out later in the afternoon so you don't really get a feel for the night life earlier in the day.  Champlung (chinese umbrellas) has good service and fantastic music!!  I can't recommend the food at any particular place and would probably recommend you eat elsewhere but it is well worth the visit just for a few drinks!!
Jasb10,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2014,"Rubbish every where along the footpath, beach crowded yet did not look inviting.  Hawkers blocking the way to the beach overcrowded with hotels - makes Sufers Paradise look like heaven and I try to avoid Surfers P!"
Sarah W,"Adelaide River, Australia",Apr 2014,"We stayed a small walk from double six beach, regularly we would walk down there. Beach was fairly clean and looks good, not as amazing as some beaches. Good for a swim and lots of keen surfers. Good atmosphere, especially around sunset. There are a few nice restaurants and places for a cocktail while there."
SaigonGal,"Liverpool, UK",Apr 2014,"Beach was fine with sunbeds and places to buy drinks. Sunsets amazing. I was not so happy to see that dog seems to have been trained to toilet in the shallow waters, and in fact the number of dogs toileting on the beach makes you wonder what the children, and us, are sitting,walking in. Still, it's nice to see that the dogs are looked after!"
Mandy B,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Mar 2014,"So enjoyed the atmosphere of kids playing, sunset cocktails, music and a great meal. Awesome!Its a short walk from Double Six street all of the little bars and restuarants service great food. They don't look like much but they are just fab."
Kanuctraveller,"London, Canada",Mar 2014,Great weather and waves but they need to rake the beach often because of garbage in the water. We paid $10 for 2 chairs and umbrellas each day. There are a to. Of vendors who ask you to buy their stuff.  Buy something and they stop. 
BrianJay2014,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",Jan 2014,"Bali has lost its romantic and exotic touch. The beach is crowded and noisy. Rubbish and people gather in the evenings to see the sunset. Water is never clear, chalky and waves too dangerous to swim. My sister's best friend's husband drowned and died in those waters there. The best thing is the untouched sunsets that fortunately, mankind cannot abuse it yet."
Ninja_Cats,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,We came here to see the sunset and it was absolutey amazing. However sadly the beach is littered with so much garbage. Still i would come here again. Right next to the beach is restraunts and hotels.
rickyrose,"pasay, philippines",Mar 2014,"No white sands, plenty of trash, not a good place for kids.  Better beaches in the Philippines and Thailand."
Maria P,"Perm, Russia",Mar 2014,"Unfortunately,i should say that water and beach became full of gabbage and plastic!This change happened just in one year and i don't have any explanation why.Many people got sick because of this water and got a ""bali belly' or ear infection!This beach still have good waves for surfing and its beautiful that's why i hope local goverment will do something!"
Karina,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2014,"Went here to hunt sunset. The view is awesome but it wasn't clean beach. Lot of plastic bag, and somehow stingy in some spot near Legian Beach."
June W,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2014,Much better than Kuta Beach for sure. Less crowded and cleaner. Rent a bodyboard for some good fun. For 2 beach chairs and a bodyboard we paid IDR 50 000. Make sure you bargain because they will always start with a ridiculous price. The waves are quite strong which was great for bodyboarding but it's not a place to just chill in the water. 
John250255,"Parkwood, Australia",Feb 2014,"The beach host left nothing wanting.  Great lounges and beach umbrellas, food and drinks easily available, all at a great rate. "
Xinni,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2014,"Rode to double 6 beach on a bike. The beach does not have crystal blue waters but it has beautiful waves for surfing. The beach is lined with beach chairs for tourist to suntan. There are many small shops selling souvenirs, clothes & paintings along the streets before reaching double 6."
Kris G,Walvis Bay,Jan 2014,"A great beach to visit , clean for indo , liked the a fine chilled atmosphere. Didn't really get hassled either. "
vee_vita,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Aug 2013,"I like to hang out in the sun beds provided by cafes in the beach. The beach is not as dirty as Dhyana Pura (Seminyak) beach which is the neighbor beach of Double Six. If you want to surf, it's not a quite great spot because the tides is not as good as in Kuta Beach. But it's great place to hang out with plentiful cafes at cheap price."
geromam,"Geraldton, Australia",Jan 2014,"The beach was strewn with rubbish and looked absolutely dreadful. I would not walk bare footed along here never knowing what was laying beneath the sand. According to locals trying to clean up, the rubbish drifts on the currents during storms from Java. I was impressed with the young lad I spoke with trying to clean up his ""patch"" for no wages. I have been to this area when it was clean, but avoid the area in January and February."
Sarah Abd Rahim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2014,A quiet beach away from the crowds of Kuta. Great for an afternoon jog along the lengthy stretch of beach. There are a number of cafes along the beach that have tables or bean bags for you to chill at and enjoy the sights. Surfing lessons also available from the locals. Great for sunsets!
Michelle T,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2013,"Well kept beach, with a super long stretch of white sand. Bars and restaurants overlook the ocean. You can rent a sunbed for a small amount of money on the sand. Lovely for an evening stroll. Watch the sunset here!!"
MariaSushi H,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Dec 2013,"When we where there beach was filled with empty bottles, plastic garbage and beach huts did not look inviting."
Andrew K,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,"The beach after it has been cleaned daily is ok.  Not quite what i expected early morning walks to be with all the debris washed up on the beach.  Afternoon and sunset it was like a totally different beach, clean and lots of activity"
Diana T,Quito,Dec 2013,"There were a lot of souvenirs stores in the Jalan Arjuna street at Double Six Beach, Seminyak.  Coming from South America i was not that impressed by the souvenirs.  In fact when I travel to a country I usually like to get souvenirs related to the traditional hand crafts/products of that country, but at Jalan Arjuna street most of the products I found were t-shirts/tops of football/basketball famous teams and very few handicraft and affordable products.  Most of the sellers have a rude and not kind attitude if you just have a look at their products and don't buy anything, but if you end up buying something they set prices waay higher than what the products are supposed to cost.  Anyways, I walked several times through this street and I found out an alley at the right side of Jl Arjuna if you face the beach, right before 66 Corner sign, so the third store had a good and fair seller, he was kind, not pushy and he even gave me a good discount, so if you are around this area and want to buy souvenirs and don't want to feel any pressure to buy anything you may want to give it a try to this store."
mhrani21,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2014,"I went there around 2 pm, there are lots of cafe and hangout place by the beach. The beach is not that clean tho' unlike the Petitenget beach. but the wave's great, nice view. Great place to spend your afternoon and just chill to watch sunset"
Danella C,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2013,"This beach was full of litter, both in the water and piles or rubbish on the beach itself. I had hoped for a swim but I'm not a huge fan of being covered in floating garbage. Very disappointing."
Jill K,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2013,Love the people on the beach. it was the wet season while we were there so it was mostly locals on the beach
JohnDaglas1,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2013,Good Close Beach which is normally busy on good days-But except soccer rackets ect A place to visit and swim in but Much better beaches available in Bali. SEARCH AT INFO STAND AND MANY FANTASTIC BEACHES FOR SAND LOVERS.
Dawn C,"Perth, Australia",May 2013,"This beach is quite nice as far as Bali beaches go.  Being from Scarborough Beach in WA it doesn't compare.  Ari Lobre is a local surfer who managers the lounge chairs right in front of the O-CE-N Outrigger and his service is awesome, not to mention his friendly conversation and gorgeous smile."
Jill D,"Nerang, Australia",Nov 2013,"An amazing experience, relaxing in a beanbag with a cocktail watching the sunset, a must do while in Bali."
Gabbi66,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2013,"Since our last visit in May, this time around, the beach was a lot cleaner, enjoyed a nice long stroll and with life guards on duty, this gives peace of mind to families traveling with kids..."
David W,"Viti Levu, Fiji",Oct 2013,"Double Six Beach is the most convenient beach to access if you are staying at Seminyak and appears to be very popular judging by the number of people who use it. There are a number of bars and restaurants along the beachfront but they are only of average standard based on our experience. At least the bintang was cold. There are plenty of beach chairs for hire and plenty of hawkers selling hats, sunglasses and other tourist items. This is a surf beach and is well positioned for the sunsets which can be really spectacular. One word of warning, you may have to wait a while to get a cab back to your accommodation from the beach, especially around peak times and the cab route back to the main street in Seminyak is not the same as the direct route to the beach so therefore costs more. Also some of the entertainment attractions that used to be at Double Six have been dismantled to make way for a new hotel/apartment development."
dani73Melbourne,melbourne,Nov 2013,Walked here from my hotel in seminyak a couple of times . Had to dodge dog poo and various rubbish items . Up on pathway rubbish piled every where . Would never swim in the water as there is sewarge spilling in to the sea
JalanJalan69,156 contributions,Nov 2013,"Surf: Waves just close out on you most of the time.Beach: Mostly dirtyBars: Lots of friendly bars on the beach -- the main attractionRestaurants: Mostly crap. Good food is in SeminyakClubs: I wouldn't go to any of them there.........Hotels: I wouldn't seriously rate any of them all that highly, they have location, but quality is generally lacking.Most annoying is the parking ticket sellers who at best are highly agro and try to rip each person who enters the beach off. Even people who they know they still try to rip off. From the time of entry to the beach there's a sense of a need to be on your guard, and that's true.The beach is full of rubbish piled up on the road.The beach is packed full of corrupt beggars who are mostly enslaved children, who will do anything to get a buck out of you, and steal your wallet or phone if they can, and swear you down in a second if you don't hand them the money that they expect from you.Other than that it's a great place to visit !!!!!!!"
Kbazi,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2013,"Was quite filled with restaurants along the beach, many seemed to have tax on the higher side and lots of locals with scooters, otherwise beach is nice lots of tourists!"
Fatmadcat,"East Drayton, UK",Oct 2013,Took surf lessons here... better to come at night when you can't see how filthy the place is - there is a whole lot of bars and restaurants lining the beach and the view is so much better... cos you can't see the debris!
Pat S,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2013,"Had enjoy a morning walk on a great beach unspoiled by crowded like Kuta ., is a peaceful beach n if you go early in morning you can see local woman praying n offering laid on the beach"
22jenny22_12,"Hunter Valley, Australia",Nov 2012,"its like bali, sunset,beer and shopping or just relax....its up to you....I liked it ...its what you want....say no if you dont want it.....pay no more than $3-00 to $5.00aud for sunnies otherwise tell thm no and mean no...they are nice but we need to tell them our price and thats it, cos they will come down....make sure yr not arguing with them,,,,,cos sometimes its like 20cents to us.theres a guy called woody woodpecker....sellling carvings...( loved them but he started out at $50,,,,I said $20 and he left and came back 3 times,,,,He is very funny....I brought it for $24 and had it shipped back at a local post place...only about 15$"
Lily A,"Birmingham, UK",Oct 2013,"As far as beaches go Double 6 beach is a true Bali experience in itself. The sunbed guys will try and rip you off by saying 2 beds are 80,000 when you can get them for 50,000. Then once you've actually settled on your sunbeds which granted are very comfy, half of the hawkers in Bali will descend on you and offer you anything from tattoos to pedicures to ice-creams (he was actually a favourite). Even pretending to be asleep doesn't work! We are pretty laid back so it didn't bother us too much but when two balinese families set up camp behind our sunbeds and kept knocking into them we were starting to wonder if we were on Punk'd. The beach itself isn't that pretty but I could people watch all day and there are plenty of beach dining and bar options if sun bathing gets a bit too much. The sea is great for surfing not so much for swimming but there are a few guys offering surfing lessons along the beach if you want to try it."
Ffteo,15 contributions,Sep 2013,"Similar to Jimbaran, along the stretch of Seminyak Beach.If you're looking for a place with less crowd. Dive, dine, enjoying sunset, jogging n etc"
Janet H,auckland,Sep 2013,"Lovely beach for swimming, surfing or just lazing on a beach chair and watching the world go by. Hawkers start to get annoying by mid morning, even when you pretend to be asleep! The ice cream man was always welcome though.Surf school was popular. Very busy at night with music, beanbags to lounge on and lit up cubes for tables and fireworks going off."
David S,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2013,"The sand is white and clear. The beach full of resort and restaurant. So many people jog and play soccer in the evening time. The wave is not that high, safe for the children to play. It used to lot quieter 6 years back when this beach wasn't that popular. "
John F,Perth,Sep 2013,"Black like dirt and smells like sewer. The sewer creek drops into the ocean making the beach even more smelly and unpleasant. And then people are wondering why they get ""bali belly"" Do not swim there as you literally swim in sewer."
tonyoneteam,"London, UK",Sep 2013,"Take a bed, let them serve you a drink, watch the learner surfers fight the waves, water is clean, locals touts friendly, easy access, great for sunsets too.."
sonbeth,perth,Sep 2013,"Dirty beach with a constant sewage smell.  Don't know why people spend their days on the sunbeds here.  Too many stray dogs and hawkers.  If you want a beach holiday, don't stay in Seminyak."
londobali,"Legian, Indonesia",Sep 2013,"It's a very nice beach to learn surfing as the waves are very forgiving and the sand-bottom is not as dangerous as coral bottom.. or just to chill and sun-bask... or to see the sunset..Lazy chairs and big umbrellas for rent everywhere, as well as boogieboards, surfboards, beach-tennis, etc.. soft drinks and beer, and a few local food stands are there.. For western lunch, try one of the restaurants on the otherside of the streets.. some even offers beach-deliveries.. :)BUT:- could be very busy on weekends, specially on high season. TIP: go to the very ends of the street, and you'll find less crowd there..- on those busy weekends parking can be a problem. TIP: DONT GO THERE in car, take motorbikes or bicycle instead. Some (usually local tourists) insist on going there with their (rental) car and makes it a total mess, as it's a dead-end street. - local government/village could make a fortune if they would make a pay-shower booth and pay-toilet there."
Ashley V,"Brighton, Australia",Sep 2013,"Warungs are right on the beach with coloured lanterns and lights and bean bags to lie down in. It is an ideal place to hang about and watch the sun go down whilst paying reasonable/cheap prices for Bintang and cocktails and ""maybe"" listening to some decent music."
Haydochick,"Ascot Vale, Australia",Sep 2013,"another nice beach in Bali, however Kuta still was best re: sand quality and surf.Many places to relax, but haggle hard for you beachfront piece of lounge.    Do not allow any peddlers to come to you  - allow one, you attract many.....  arghhhhh"
Farfaraway1972,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2013,"This was the second time we had visited a beach in Bali. In July 2012 we went to Echo Beach, which is nice, but not good for kids. Just for surfers and a great place to eat & drink.This time (Sep 2013) we visited Double Six Beach, which was nice, but your could smell the sewerage, which was not so great. Not too many people ""stalking"" you with ""crap"" and after politely saying no, they went away. It is pretty clean, not too much rubbish, and the kids had a ball"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Aug 2013,"A great spot to watch the sun go down whilst sitting in a bean bag with a bintang.Can be quite dirty with rubbish / drains in places along with the steady stream of hawkers trying to sell their wares.There is however some excellent eateries just up the road on 66 street , this end seems to be going through a transformation with new building and renovations happening in the vicinity."
Paul M,"Munich, Germany",Aug 2013,"Great beach for surfing or enjoying the waves, but avoid the rip-off sunshade and loungers - they charge up tp 250,000 rupiah. Most other places in Bali charge nothing if you eat at their restaurant. "
jaylowe,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2013,"Many surfing coaches teach classes here, so that it's quite busy. There are two big drains that pour smelly water into the sea... So, we didn't really swim there. The sidewalk around the beach smells like urine. I guess it's okay to sunbath and watch people surfing. But if you're picking a nice secluded beach, go somewhere else."
joeyjoeo,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2013,"This is a nice beach if you can see past the garbage.  Like the title says, this is the Dirty end of town.  The beaches further south are much cleaner.  The footpaths here are very bad also.  The area seems very popular for some but not me.  I could not wait to get out of this area."
sara m,"Saint Louis, MO",Sep 2013,"After reading all the reviews about the Seminyak area we booked 3 nights at Villa Kresna in Seminyak. The villa itself was nice but the Seminyak beach and area was dirty, difficult to walk around in (poor sidewalks and tons of motorbikes) and the shops were expensive. This area seems better suited to younger patrons who like to party on the beach. The beach itself was not clean and at various points sewage water came into the ocean from the land. The streets of Seminyak square were so busy with cars and scooters that you had to watch where you walked to not trip over the small edge of sidewalk. The food at the 6 restaurants we ate in was typical Bali, wonderful and inexpensive but you don't have to be there. We have now been in Sanur for 6 nights and are so much happier. Clean beaches, wonderful sidewalk on the beach and in town. Lots of choices for the wonderful food and generally a more relaxed, beach vacation."
markbutt62,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,has really nice restaurants but will cost you for parking and needs public toilets but so does most popular beaches in Bali
KLWebb,Rockingham,Aug 2013,Absolutely a must while in Bali. Sit in a bean bag on the beach with a cocktail or two and a bite to eat and watch the sun go down. This is always a highlight and a must do when your in Bali.
Pieces of P,5 contributions,Jul 2013,"We had planned a pretty last minute exchanging of vows with just family and close friends and we were recommended by Alam Warna Resort to get in touch with a wedding planner, Mita, who understood that we were on a tight budget as we just had 2 weddings already. She still obliged in providing a restaurant with an affordable and fresh seafood dinner set and set up a romantic table with lanterns for us. It took all of us by surprise as we arrived at the location. It wasn't too overly crowded and the service was superb. The seafood was so fresh and well cooked. If you ever go to go to Double Six Beach, look for Amazing Bali Cafe (ABC). And if you're look for a wedding planner or event organizer for weddings, anniversaries etc. do contact info@batikbaliwedding.com and look them up at http://www.batikbaliwedding.com/. Had an unforgettable time. It was perfect! Coincidentally they had fireworks which just added more 'wow' factor to our little reception. The only regret was that we didn't make the reception during sunset and didn't have enough funds to get a photographer and other services from the full package."
Mia R,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,started off very quiet - we were the only people there and we going to leave. Decided to stay for one more drink and once the band came on - we realised that this could be the making of a good nite - it turned out to be a fantastic nite!
MirantiKemala,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2013,"I particularly like this beach in the morning. Not too crowded as Kuta. Morning run from Double Six - Kuta, or Double Six - Seminyak is a good track. Try running with your feet and feel the sand and the breeze!"
AliyaCHL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Aug 2013,Don't find it spectacularly beautiful - but the beach is clean and probably not as crowded as Kuta beach. 
johnberndt,"New York City, NY",Jul 2013,12 noon till 3am this is the beach where all the action is. grab a bottle of wine and walk up and down the strip.
Fraser G,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2013,Beach is great and is home to some really cool bars with music at sundown. Mixture of cheap bars and really trendy (but still pretty cheap). Beach has everything you would want it to have and is right next to Legian markets etc. Worth doing!!
Mich_Vintcent,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2013,"We came to 66 beach because the branded surf schools (rip curl and quicksilver ) are here and our children wanted to learn to surf. The surf conditions are relatively safe here most of the time compared to beaches further north, but you do need to be on high alert at all times because there can suddenly be strong currents and rips. What I disliked most about this beach was the constant harassment from beach hawkers. If offered something once, and you decline it, and they go away, that is fine. But many times they won't accept a single 'no, thank you' and the same person will come back 5 or 6 times in the same day! Some kind of intervention is required because the beach hawking is out of control. "
Sarahyoung28,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2013,"We took our young children down to Double six beach to swim in the afternoon and it was quite nice on the sun lounges, but by 4:30-5:00 pm the beach was full of drunk Aussies with young indo women and it was an awful place for a young family. Would never go there again. Slightly further up the beach in Seminyak is much nicer, with bean bags on the beach and great cafes with yummy woodfired pizzas, not to mention a much nicer family atmosphere. Double six beach is dirty and sleazy YUK!"
Liverpool051,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,"A massive and very busy beach. Sand was nice, and sea is shallow and water is clean.  Good to learn to surf. My 8 yr old and husband paid $50 (US) for a 90 min lesson. Make sure you stay in the yellow and red flags though as it can be dangerous.  There was a report in the paper of a tourist drowning this week.  We paid 270 rup for 3 beds and drinks all day ( beer and water) and 2 surf boards too.  This was at the far end of the beach where the vendor has Bob Marley decor.  I think it's called One Love.  The constant sellers of silver tat, bracelets, CD,s, DVD,s, magazines and fruit are very annoying when they do not take no for an answer. I did not like about 5 of them gathering around my bed and not moving. I found the best way to not get hassled was to wear sunglasses and a hat and pretend they did not exist.  It's a pity there are so many wild dogs roaming around too.  I know some of them may be rabid, which made me fear for my children's life - literally.  But they just poo on the beach and no one clears it ( or any other litter up).  I would have happily paid the seller's to pick up the poo and tidy the beach, instead of trying to sell me tat. The bars and restaurants along that road are ok, but nothing special."
lkpoli,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2013,"It's crowded long beach with many seas activity!You can get most of the top notch restaurant on the beach, having your cocktails or meal with the great sea view!"
ABAAJacobs,CPT-South Africa,Jun 2013,"there are always people.It is very busy and lost of hustle and bustle.There are shops and restaurants on the main road opposite the beach.There are always people wanting to sell you something,or braid your hair, or give you a massage etc.A little pricey with the goods they try to sell.Great hotels on the strip."
KayvD,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2013,"What better way to end a day than sipping half price cocktails, sitting in bean bags, watching the sunset and listening to the waves. Make the effort, it's bliss."
breadlovesbutter,"London, England, United Kingdom",Dec 2012,"Whenever I visit my friends in Bali we use Double six as a meeting point. The cafe's along the front perfect to sit after your morning dog walk, or after a day at the beautiful beach. Have your nails done whilst your sunbathing from one of the local girls (help them to survive!). Sometimes the beach vendors can be annoying so it's good to know how to say NO!! or Suda (If spelt correctly means ""already""). Great place to people watch and if you're lucky enough to be there on a Sunday to watch the sun come down you will also experience the locals coming out to play football or just hang out with their children and friends relaxing - This is a wonderful people watching area."
Missykatz,"Pismo Beach, CA",Sep 2012,"Had fun surfing and relaxing, but it is a beach full of people and vendors.  Not a quiet private beach by any stretch."
cheung w,"Seoul, South Korea",Jul 2013,"In addition to learning to play surf here, you can also enjoy the beach atmosphere while enjoying dinner. Because in this area that provides many restaurant for dinner."
SenyumDunia,"Brussels, Belgium",Jun 2013,"In Bali, we have several address that we keep. Double Six area is definitely one of them. A street full of range of restaurants and cafes are ready to welcome you. "
PatBintang,"Lanzarote, Spain",Jul 2013,Years ago the beach was quite clean down here but now the sand got more and more grey. The little creeks flowing through the beach from inland with the invested stinking water makes it even worth. Water quality must be really bad with brown foam on the surface where the creeks hit the ocean. Shame for Bali and lot's to clean up.
Katya R,Arusha,May 2013,"I was hoping my husband can learn to surf there, as I remember it being nicer than Kuta, and quite fun with all the little cafes and not overcrowded. The parking personnel asked for 2$ per hour parking fee, we went out of the car and were hit by the smell of sewage running into the sea, there pedestrian walk was filled with tourists, and coming out on the beach we just saw mile and miles of sun beds with umbrellas, and herds of hustlers selling you everything from sarongs, cheap bracelets and massage. We spent 5 minutes there and ran away. We ended up learning to surf on a lovely beach next to OM restaurant in Canggu and had a great time."
travelexpert w,"Tokyo, Japan",Jun 2013,"Very nice beach in Bali, there are lots of things to do, surfing, soccer, tanning, sunset. will be back"
Steve Herman,"Alexandria, VA",Jun 2013,Nice surf and sand but can become very crowded and the roaming touts are almost as annoying as on beaches south (Kuta and Legian). 
Magdala79,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2013,Quiet beach with many unique beach cafes. Pretty quiet even for the weekend. Beach is clean too. Only downside is the ladies who would offer their services to you. Remember to bargain the prices. Check out the prices in their massage parlour before hitting the beach... 
Eat1Drink2Travel3,"London, UK",Jun 2013,"Double six is bang in the middle of Kuta and Seminyak and a better beach than either for a number of reasons. It is more relaxed than Kuta but livelier than the end of Seminyak which is just a backyard of 5 star hotels. Th beach shacks provide sun beds, beer and great satay. What else could you want? Oh, some shallow water bathing could be nice, but it's all big waves. So bring your shades and enjoy watching the surfers dance on the waves."
cindychng77,Singapore,Jun 2013,"Am an amateur surfer, and Double Six beach, although popular, is not too crowded that I cant get on a surf. I usually rent the board from Andy's beach near the Lanai entrance and spend the day on the deck chair sipping Bintangs and catching some sun and surf - definitely a great way to relax! Food around the area is only so-so but the chicken wings at Lanai are good!"
Fio ng,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2013,I like the fine sand and the long coastline. We took some great pictures there. The beach is not as crowded as Kuta beach.
whitstar,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",May 2013,"Look it's Bali, I know, but when I go to the beach, I like to relax. You just can't here. You are constantly, and I mean all the time, bothered by the street sellers who do not take a polite no for an answer. One sat down on my sun lounge trying to convince me to buy a pirate kite. The only way we could get some peace was to pretend we were asleep and that still didnt stop them. Witnessed a few dogs doing number twos in the ocean. Apart from that, cheap sunbeds, cold beers and awesome waves. Enjoyed the soccer match, except when the ball hit me on the head when I was asleep :)"
dekanggit,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"My favorite place to do daily sport like jogging, volley beach, sunbathing, learn to surf, etc. The beach and sands was almost same with Kuta. But double six beach more quiet. Beside doing some sports, people also enjoying party on beach, chillin with their pets, enjoy the sunset, etc. But must be carefully beacuse I had bad experience. It was two dogs in double six run down for me when I was jogging."
Jayson C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2013,"Cool Beach, Food's are available. the chairs cost 30000IDR, cant really swim our far as the guards will warn."
WiestGabi,"Florianopolis, SC",May 2013,"The beach itself is like Kuta, grey sand and grey sea, but the beach clubs are the highlight of the place. It has a lot of them, very cozy and with a really nice chilling out area. The drinks a very expensive but it worths to have a drink to see the sunset."
Lorraine P,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2013,Loved the small fee to have the use of a large sunbed and umbrella for the day!  In the afternoon a local soccer match was set up and was also enjoyed by the spectators!  Sunsets are unbelievably beautiful and seem to last for ever.  Vendors are persistent but one can't help liking them and even be-friending several.
stephanieosigli,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2013,loved the beach for just a small price of $3 AUD you can rent a banana lounge and be serviced cold drinks but the lovely beach.other then people hassling you to buy things was overall relaxing!
J0insing,"Medstead, UK",Apr 2013,"The Good:It's Bali!  The sea is warm, the sun is shining, the surf is fantastic, sunsets are epic, the loungers and umbrellas are cheap(ish), there are endless ladies to massage your back or do things to your hands and feet, the beer is cold.  Beachboys are keen to teach you to surf or just to hire you some boards - and everyone is happy and having a great time.  The beach bars come out at night with beanbags to relax on and watch the sunset - whats not to like?The Bad:Well - there ARE a few things not to like...1) Some days, the smell of sewage is strong in some parts of the beach.  That's a bit alarming given how much of the water goes up your nose, in your mouth, if you are as bad at surfing as I am2) Along with the smell, there was a suspicious looking brown scummy foam in some areas of the beach3) Two days of our stay, there was virtually no safe swimming area due to the size of the waves/rip.  The small area that was available was, you guessed it, right in the brown scummy foamy area"
mlock2000,"Tacoma, WA",Apr 2013,double six was the first beach we went to during our stay in Bali. it was a short taxi ride from where we were staying in Seminyak. upon arriving we notices the sewage smell right away. it was not goody. we walked as far as we could down the beach away from the smell. it was easy and cheap to find chairs. i even rented a boogie board for 3 bucks. the waves were amazing and we had plenty of fun! its not the cleanest beach along this coast but for one day it wasnt bad. there are little cafes and restaurants all around and some good shopping too!
1NZfamilyof4,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Nov 2012,"If you want to be in the heart of the action, see, hear and smell the epic waves of Bali this is the place!  It is full to the brim of life and love!  I love the fruit lady!  I love the beach chairs! I love everything about this place! If you only have a few days in Bali aim for here!!"
FEbulous,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Feb 2013,really crowded but I'm enjoy with that. I've seen beautiful sunset from this place. I visited this place with friends and enjoy some drink while see the sunset... pretty good !!
AngelinaK656,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2013,"The beach was very nice to spend time with family. After the activity on the beach we can enjoy local cuisine to foreign countries. And at midnight, we are also able to simply drink while meeting colleagues, because in this place many cafe / pub until closing late at night."
583RS,"Tokyo, Japan",Mar 2013,"I found this beach to be moderately dirty - lots of trash around.  Surf is great - but wouldn't visit again.  Shopping around it is good, though"
Jamie,"South Australia, Australia",Mar 2013,"Loved just walking up the beach and grabbing a cold beer and beanbag, watching the locals surf, play football, volleyball and relax."
Mylene A,"Montreal, Canada",Mar 2013,If you love surfing and amazing sunset ... this is the place!Love it! The beach is clean and somehow very quiet.Sparkle by small lovely bars ... perfect for the apero for the sunsets!
hmpbpd,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Double Six beach is a Seminyak Staple. It's filthy during wet season (January and February) but the fine sand and flat surface make it perfect for exercise. It's particularly smelly at the end of Jalan Double 6 where the river dumps into the ocean. But the sand is fine and nice on the feet.With this and all other Bali beaches, keep your expectations realistic and you will have a great time. "
kormensandiego,"Manila, Philippines",Mar 2013,"Legian Beach, where Double Six Beach is, is actually a middle point between Kuta Beach and Seminyak Beach.  Double Six is just near the edge of Legian and start of Seminyak.In terms of crowd, you can see less of a crowd here than Kuta Beach, although you can still see lots of umbrella lounges for you to sit and enjoy the beach.  There are quite a number of surf schools here, so you can see some beginners trying to learn to surf.  This area is definitely not for swimming as the waves are strong.  But it's a nice place to stroll around the beach and hear the waves.There are some warungs around the area too, where you can get some food.  And there are a couple of bars just off the street parallel to the beach, if you dig the night life.You can see locals selling their wares, but they are not pushy as I've read about.  They sell jewelries, watches, kites.  The kites were actually quite nice and intricate, I saw one they were flying which was a pirate ship with many sails.  Actually I was just walking along, they offered 200,000 at first then even without any reaction from me except a smile, they lowered it to 100,000.  I figured I could get it for 50,000 if I haggled, haha!  But I didn't intend to buy it since it was too difficult to bring home anyway.The sand is ok, but it's brown.  There are also some garbage along the beach, plus patches of them along the sides, which is really a waste of the beauty of the beach.  I don't mind the brown/black sand as long as the beach is clean.  My friend told me Kuta Beach is even worse.In the evening, you can see a lot of local folks who have come to enjoy the beach.I was excited to see the sunset, unfortunately, it was raining that day, so I missed it.  Instead, I had a walk under the rain with my umbrella on the pathway just parallel to the beach, which was also nice ;-)"
Angan A,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2013,"Two and three years ago, this beach still offered a peaceful ambience, as not really much hotel were built. Compare to this year, that we found it hard to find car park though you have to pay for parking retribution. Food seller is not much like in Sanur. Unless you bring more money, better eat in Goodys or some resto besides it."
James Q,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Beach is great, just dont go in the ocean! Very visible sewage / oil in the water. Lots of litter; paper, cups, bags, etc floating in the water and washing ashore. A real shame. Bali must clean up its act!"
Guillaume P,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2013,"This beach is covered of plastic bags on the beach and in the water. It is really disgusting. And if you date to go in the water, you will feel some tiny little things (cant see, they are too small) biting your skin. You got 2 sewage areas on the beach too, which doesnt help... Just avoid the place!"
Lil-Bali-Traveller,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Nov 2012,Great sunset and sunbathing placeLove this beach and the sceneryWe always bring our client here also to enjoy the horse riding and to visit our favorite cafe
Clarissa11_11,"Sydney Olympic Park, Australia",Mar 2013,"The water was lovely, but the beaches and the rubbish is a real turnoff. I've been to many other third world countries, they have always appeared to keep the tourist areas somewhat clean, but not in Bali, disappointing."
SandeepBalaji,"Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India",Jan 2013,A bit dirty but then thats the case with a lot of Kuta and Seminiyak with the tourist explosion. Nice beach to chill and watch the sunset.
jessica m,"New York City, NY",Jan 2013,"I remember that was a nice beach near my hotel when I went to seminyak, Bali. Very nice sunset when I enjoy it in that beach. Nice bar too around there. Good place for enjoy the sunset"
Adhy76,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2013,It is a great beach to walk and play around. There are several cafes near the beach to hangout and see sunset from there.
Latitudes-Longitudes,"San Francisco, California",Jan 2013,"I love going for sunset drinks to the bars on this area, the black sand and colorful cushions create a nice atmosphere.Is a pitty there is so much trash floating ashore from the currents coming from other islands.This ruins the view and experience of a ""romantic"" moment.Still, nice to go for a drink the rest of the year."
Lina Jasin,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2012,"The best place to hang out and go crazy a bit, get drunk and dance, if you feel hot then go to the beach for oxygen then comeback, go with friends or your love one, its fun to release our stress after too much works"
Bhavan45,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2012,Went down here late afternoons for a beer. Lots of hawkers who you learn to ignore or joke with. Good if you have a family as the kids can play. Pleasant walk back to Seminyak.
ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"The Primo photo op spot on Nusa Penida! Crowds of tourists and influencers flock to the well worn outcrop above this beach to take a selfie. The best experience remains to be had on the sands below. The path to get there is steep and will require a certain stamina to retrace your steps back to the road. When you finally reach the shore, its paradise!"
Florencia M,"Palembang, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"It was last year when I visited Nusa Penida, Bali. At that time I thought Kelingking Beach is only beautiful at photos. I wasn‚Äôt expecting too much, but when me and my family arrived at Kelingking Beach I was speechless and it‚Äôs beyond my expectation! such an unforgettable memories and it‚Äôs an honor to me that I can visit this place, I would recommend you 1000000/10 to visit this place someday! even tho the weather is hot, but it doesn‚Äôt matter! You also can swim at the beach by walking down the stairs and maybe it will take for about 30 minutes to reach the beach. But trust me, it‚Äôs all worth it!"
John Jackson,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,"Well, I go to nusa penida island at lest 2-3 times per year with friends!So I will highly recommend you to rest before you go and have a good lunch!It will take a lot of time and effort to go down and back! I always enjoy it but Its not easy especially If not everyone in your group do work out every day ! So just get ready for people start crying!Its sunny so put some sun cream!  You can carry your water and etc but surprise surprise you can buy drinks by the beach too! Its soft drinks places so you can carry drinks or just some cash!Too about 1 hour down and back! Some people much longer!note: its no private or parking area so people just leave it anyhow! And its not easy to find this place so i will advice you to get a private guide! thats why my friends always asking me to join hahahaWe usually will racing with guys! Enjoy your day!"
Raymondale,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2019,"Visited here last year in June,it is the landmark of Nusa Penida,kelingking means pinkie finger,the famous pic of this place is the cliff form in the shape of pinkie finger,thats why the local called it kelingking(pinkie),you will be exhausted if you want to go down to the beach.but it is worth doing so.once you reach the beach,you will feel so relaxed,and want to stay here longer.but the waves is strong,so not suitable for swimming. along the way to the beach, sometimes a bit dangerous,so take care of yourself.i should stay here longer, but sadly due to limited time,have to go up to meet my driver.will come again."
TravellorNewDelhi,New Delhi,Dec 2019,there is a lot of walking to do here. but it still really amazing. At the time we went the place was quite crowded. 
Mariana Lucas,"Croydon, UK",Jul 2019,"One of the best spots in Nusa Penida. Amazing views, make sure to get there early. Luckily we got there around 10 am and there was no queue, only a few people walking up and down. Make sure to take some comfortable shoes. We took flip flops and we had to be very careful. If you are looking to go all the way down to the beach it will take you around 30/40 minutes so be prepared for the time of your life. The stairs going down are very narrow and you have to watch your step. The stairs are pretty crowded with people coming up and going down. If you are afraid of heights or if you don't have good balance I wouldn't recommend. This does require some level of fitness but once you get down, you will encounter the most amazing sand. Just watch out for the waves as they are very strong and they can pull you in. I would not recommend swimming in these waters. Perfect place for those Instagram pics! "
Daniel Makuso,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2019,You should try to come here. Want to come back again üòò. There is most people to take picture. You will see the monkey group also there üôà
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2019,"The T Rex shaped cliff side at Kelingking Beach has rocketed tourism into the sky with its natural beauty. Thanks to social media, Instagram especially this viewpoint is now top of most people‚Äôs list of attractions when heading over Bali. The beach itself is secluded, white sandy haven surrounded by turquoise waters. "
Otmane R,13 contributions,Sep 2019,"This spot should be on everyone's bucketlist, I've never seen such a beauty, it's worth a one day visit.If you go there just be bold and do the hike (it's tiring but not dangerous)You should just mind to have a suitable footwear, sunscreen and a cap.Be careful ! if you drop your phone you'll never see it again üòÇ"
TheHumbleTravellers,"Greater Noida, India",Nov 2019,One of the most iconic beach in the world and no doubt why it is so. We visited this one our one day tour of Nusa Penida.Its nature's paradise.
J0andChris,"Dewsbury, England",Oct 2019,"Stunning views, can get very busy.We visited via a private tour using Warung Coconut, great value tour and extremely helpful guide.   It is quite a steep trek down to the actual beach if you decide to venture down.  The views from the cliffs above are absolutely beautiful.  There are a selection of cafe bars at the top.  Well worth a visit if you are on the island. The roads are very narrow to get there, so highly recommend using a private tour."
rolf_the_viking,"Stockholm, Sweden",Dec 2019,The trip down and up is the main thing you will need to taka swim to cool down after the walk. Reserve enough time for this if you plan to go down to the beach
Elang Prima Tours,"Flores, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"Nusa Penida it,s the best place to visiting. Beautufull panorama beach make every tourist will be come back again. You can going by Fast Boat Cruises 40 minuts from Sanur harbour. One day for visiting many place at Nusa Penida its our service."
ivani,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"I really love this beach especially if it could be a little bit quite. It is really worth to go down and do the trekking, it was like a treasure for me. "
Blefourie P,"Vancouver, Canada",Dec 2019,"The view itself is beautiful! But take the time to hike down to the beach. It's super steep but so worth it! You won't regret it! Go there late afternoon, less people and not too too hot! GO!!!"
LiesL27,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,We went there in the afternoon so it was super hot. Better to go in the morning or in the afternoon i think.Next visit i would like to climb down the white sandy beach.
Diana Satari,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"the best time to visit is in the afternoon, the less crowd, the best time to enjoy the scenery especially the sunset"
Samuel Pasaribu,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"This is the best and most famous spot in Nusa Penida. Nusa Penida can be reached by boat from Sanur Beach Harbour in 1 hour. From Buyuk Harbour in Nusa Penida, Kelingking Beach is around 30 minutes by car. From the car park we must take a walk for around 100 m. There are some viewing spots. Try all to take best picture from several angles.In holiday season this spot is very crowded. And in December also very hot.The very unique is the shape of the cape looks like t-rex head."
Steve B,"Cairns Region, Australia",Dec 2019,Always a great spot but has become a tourist Mecca in the last couple of years. It‚Äôs as good as the Instagram pics but get there early before the dayboats arrive. It gets hectic after 9am. Watch the monkeys too. No eye contact or they‚Äôll go you. Our second visit and no doubt not our last. Will aim for sunset next trip. 
Sacha Schwarzkopf,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"The Views, awesomeThe landscape, stunningA bit of traffic going there since the streets can get very narrow.  Once there the crowd does make one a bit anxious as the first few photo opps along the stairs too are narrow.  But chill enjoy take a deep breath it‚Äôs lovely.If you wish to take the harrowing journey all the way to the beach, you really should be in good condition.  Strong legs, good knees and such.Despite some drawbacks, it‚Äôs worth the view!"
Tosia1988,Warszawa,Dec 2019,Totally amazing place. A lot of people like in every tourist places. I recommend go there as earlier you can. 
KatrinJ_est,"Tallinn, Estonia",Dec 2019,"However, its totally overcrowded. Also there is very hot, so we didnt hike down... it wud have been noce to swim there üôÇBut view is nice, it was worth the visit."
Casy Ang,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,"This place is famous for the instagram-worthy picture and expects more crowd. We went there on Friday around 12pm. The place is crowded with China tourists. You have to walk around 5-8mins from carpark area to the Kelingking Beach entrance aka stairs. The stairs are quite narrow, ground not even (mud surface) and the hand rails are made from trees branches. Must be extra careful when you walk down the stairs & not to fall down because the side is high cliffs. We didn't walk all the way down because our driver said it's quite long way to hike down to the beach and bit dangerous for us. So we only stop half way and spot few picturesque views to take pictures. You might need to queue up at famous photo spot. Overall, we take around 40mins at that place. "
Victoria L,9 contributions,Oct 2019,Beautiful! This place is spectacular. The steps down to the beach are treacherous so be prepared. Part required scrambling on all fours. It was worth it for us 
A.B. De Castro,Philippines,Dec 2019,"Kelingking Beach would definitely mesmerize anyone upon seeing the natural formations. If you really want to get to the beach, you need to climb down thousand of steps that are very steep. You'll also need to allot 2-4 hours so that you could enjoy the beach because once you get finished, you'll climb the thousands of steps whence you came. If you'll stay at the top and take pictures, make sure you bring water as it is very hot throughout the day."
Kenai Drift Anglers,"Soldotna, AK",Dec 2019,"We went here twice and would recommend the same to you. We went for the sunset, parked and walked to the view point, we didn't have to pay for some reason, I think the people went home. However, we caught the sunset at perfect timing, I believe it was around 5 PM. A lot of people at the viewpoint and a lot of people walking up, they seemed so tired. Which made us a bit nervous about our next day. However, we didn't have any issues with the trek down. Take it slow! Don't get discouraged with all the people at the view point hardly anyone was actually walking down! Best time to the hike is later afternoon when it's not so hot and then you can walk up at sunset! Best way! Maybe 20 people on the beach. We would recommend not doing it in sandals we had Keen water shoes that we great for the trek! This is a must!"
calm999,"Kuta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"Breathtaking place. I was one of the few people who went down to the beach. It was not easy at all, so be careful if you are not fit enough with good health. I found one guy on his way back laying down and can't breathe well or move, so many good. People help him restore his energy.Not to scare you, just do it if are fit and prepared well.Fore me something to remember it all my life."
Yoke,Malaysia,Nov 2019,"Amazing Sunset view! Estimate travel time around 1 hour from the port to reach here. Even is not far but the road condition will slow you down.I'm so happy that we have come here. it feel like so blessed to have this nice view together with your loved one.We bring some beer and light food sitting down and wait until sunset start. When sunset start it will be very fast, we are so happy that we able see it!True is, this place is dangerous. Once wrong step then you will say goodbye to the world. Please be careful if you have kids. It is extremely dangerous if didn't watch closely.You can go down to the beach but it is dangerous. The strong wave actually bring down few life before. The light is limited at this island. If you are not familiar, please rent you driver."
Lena,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,"Pro - nice scenery, windy, beautiful beach. Cons: only if the steps are fixed properly. Advise: You can spend longer time here and trek down to the beach, I believe it has awesome wave. "
Ktong002,"Hong Kong, China",Nov 2019,"Getting up and down to the beach not impossible, but tiring for sure (esp under bright burning sun). If you simply wanna take photos of T Rex from all angles, you dont need to walk all the way down. Instead you can go along the cafes and there is a farmland nearby where there are plenty of quiet but nice viewpoints of T Rex too."
bigwik,"Budapest, Hungary",Dec 2019,Beautiful Cliff formation thst surroinds a beach. Make sure you get there as early as possible to beat the heat and the hundreds of turists. Prepared for the bumpy roads
Cristine_02,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Love it so much. Nice sea and cliffs . It Super hot but worth going. Expect to climb up n down to get a great view 
Elizabeth S,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Dec 2019,It‚Äôs not easy getting down and back up to/from the beach but it is well worth it. Not overcrowded and just stunning. 
timgiang,"Yucaipa, CA",Dec 2019,"This was by far the highlight of our vacation. While it is a crazy hike down and up and the heat is sweltering, the picturesque views at the bottom are well worth it. The sand is perfect, one can cool off in the water and the beach in general is isolated. If you‚Äôre on a tour of Kelingking, billabong beach, and crystal bay, be sure to spend the majority of your time here as the other locations pale in comparison."
Luke,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2019,"Be warned, exercise is a must :)The journey down the stairs to kelingking beach is quite difficult, so if you get exhausted easily, don‚Äôt try, as you need to go back up and it‚Äôs very steep. No other way except for the steep stairs. Half way down the mountain the stairs stop and it becomes more of a mountain climb but it has a handrail the whole time to assist in going down and back up. The beach down the bottom was totally worth the journey though as the water was perfectly clear and great for swimming in. There is a shop at the bottom that sells drinks and snacks also, as you will need refreshments after the exhausting climb down. "
Krystyna L,14 contributions,Dec 2019,"So your trip begin with the place where millions of people try to take the best photo of them, you may think that there is no place for you, but it‚Äôs not true, people do it very fast and you at least take a photo , a view is incredible for sure. Then you have an opportunity to go down to the beach , but be ready the way to beach is not for children ( I was surprised when I saw 8years old boy with father, it‚Äôs crazy) and people with health issues, because it‚Äôs a way under the sun for 30-35 min . When you go down or up you meet the people behind and front of you, the way is too narrow , so please be careful and put hiking shoes on. Don‚Äôt forget about water!!!!Finally when you already reach your destination point , it‚Äôs worth it, because you are in paradise with amazing view and enormous waves .So, you can do it, but be careful and stay positive "
Abhi5684,"Jaipur, India",Aug 2019,"The view point is quite picturesque and is simply one of the best views one gets in Indonesia, but is so much crowded that you wont feel like staying for a bit and is close to get spoiled sooner. One would struggle to get a picture with clear background.Expect a lot of driving, through bad roads, to reach to the point and is quite a walk to reach the view point."
Henry T,15 contributions,Dec 2019,"Incredible natural formation with crystal blue water and a flawless beach. Those expecting to swim in the water beware! Tides and currenst are extremely strong and not recommended for swimming. The hike down toward the beach is strenuous, with no shade available. Bring water and appropriate shoes and a small umbrella if you can!"
GRtravelling,Seattle,Nov 2019,"Becoming a definite tour destination with a crazy amount of motorbikes, vans and cars pouring into the area on narrow challenging roads.Once there, through the crowds it is a stunning view."
Loca_Lisa,"Meridian, ID",Sep 2019,"If you're thinking of motorbiking here from anywhere, rethink that and get a driver. The road is seriously bad and 15 miles turns into a hour drive to avoid the pot holes. Get here super early. As crowds get here around 9 am and parking is hard to find as well as getting a decent picture of T-Rex rock or the beach . The view is stunning, the water is the most beautiful blue. There area has few view vistas to get your picture, however lines can be long and you can easily wait 15 mins for your 15 seconds. I stayed for about 15 mins before the crowds were overwhelming.There is a few warungs located here so food and drinks are plentiful. The hike down to the beach is around 30 minutes from the top but we opted not to do it."
Irina H,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",Aug 2019,What an experience to be able to get to this place and finally be able to lean over the cliff. The pictures are amazing but do not do any justice to the actual view. Good luck going down :)
Arney,20 contributions,Nov 2019,"Breathtaking. A must see for the world traveller. To walk down is for able bodied experienced walkers and swimmers. Not for the faint hearted as is it a sheer cliff of several hundred metres. 30 mins down, over an hour back up. Those not able or wanting to go down can still get the best photos of their lives from the top. Cold refreshments available near the car park."
Louise,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Nov 2019,"We came at 8 AM and there were o ly few other people. Lovely view. We didn't go down, because I've heard you have to slide some of the way down. They had new roads so it wasn't a problem driving scooter all the way there "
ditchthislife,"Regina, Canada",Nov 2019,"We arrived at Kelingking Beach early, before all the day-trippers, which I highly recommend. The view is absolutely stunning! We hiked only about 1/3 of the way down. The stairs are very steep and uneven. If you want to go the entire route they say it takes about 40 minutes to get down and an hour to get back up.Make sure to check out the view to the left of all of the restaurants. You can also get stunning pictures from that area."
MoNiKa D,"Witten, Germany",Nov 2019,"This trail will not be any easier, this trail will be rocky and difficult - this is absolutely perfect for kelingking beach!  If you want to get down in the heat and get back up - it has to be really good and fit, but it's worth it!  However, climbing is announced here and is not without danger!  So not suitable for everyone.  away down we needed 30 min and high 20 min.  exhausting but who made it, can be proud of itself.  The view from the top is of course unique and must be visited, if you are on Nusa Penida."
Madnesss,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019,"Firstly, the road to get to this place is very reasonable compared to many in Penida.  That‚Äôs a bonus.  So you could scooter from the harbour to hear no worries. Now this place was just to beautiful.  There are many viewing spots for this place.  You can pay a 5000rp donation to go up to a viewing platform which I did and stayed there as it was magnificent.  I launched the drone from up there too.  I did lose some gps a bit when I went high so had to bring it down a bit.  Plus I am not a very experienced drone pilot. There are monkeys here too so if you‚Äôre scared get someone to shoe them away for you.  There‚Äôs plenty of warungs to eat or drink at.  Parking tip - they charge and then point you to a parking area, however you can ride closer down and park elsewhere.  This is an absolute must see in Penida.  We did not go down to the beach, however I believe it takes about 30-45 mins down and same up.  On sometimes vertical track where you have to slide on your bum.  Not for me.  You need to be super fit to go down to the beach. "
Chris S,"Gamlingay, UK",Nov 2019,"We went in low season, but even then it was busy with Instagram warriors queuing up in sweltering heat for once spot at the top of the cliff. Ignore these clowns and walk about 100m down the cliff for the same if that's what you're there for.The preparation part: if you want to actually go on to the beach it's roughly a 25 min, relatively intense walk/climb down. Do not attempt in flip-flops, and bring a bottle of water each. There are choke points where you'll have to wait 5+ mins for people to go up/down, and it is very steep at points. Essentially they've tacted barriers onto quite a sheer cliff face.It's well worth the climb however. The beach was relatively quiet (note again low season), has a shop for drinks and light snacks.The waves were powerful. It's not a beach for chilled floating around unless you swim past the sand bar and break. (Which is totally do able). Also be aware there is a strong rip tide.Had a great time, it's very clear water aside the sand being churned up and refreshingly cool."
Marco A,"London, UK",Nov 2019,"I have to admit, having been in Nusa Penida for a few days I couldn‚Äôt be bothered to do the 45 min trek down to the actual beach itself (what people who had just done the trip told me) having done so many of the hikes for the other stuff on the island I was just happy to look over the stunning view. The beach looks insane, so kind of gutted I didn‚Äôt go down! No one was in the water and the waves seem too powerful to swim.... which is what the below reviews also say. Absolutely stunning view and a must visit. "
iamkayoh,472 contributions,Nov 2019,The view at Kelingking Beach is stunning!The place is quite busy with tourists but not overly packed. You can choose to descend the steep flight of stairs to the beach itself. But make sure you leave enough energy to climb back up! üòÑNot much activities here to do there except to admire the beautiful scenery. 
Pam R,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2019,"What an amazing spot!  Water colour is stunning. White sand. Clean beach. Waves can be rough so you need to be careful. The climb up and down is for the fit otherwise it will be a struggle coming up. It is very steep and can be narrow in parts. Most of the track is made from clay so it isn‚Äôt man made ‚Äòstairs‚Äô. We wore thongs going down, not a good idea! And we put our joggers on coming back up. If you have joggers definitely wear them. Take water a large one with you in a backpack as you will need both hands free for the climb. There is water on sale on the beach but I believe it is expensive. Only toilets are at the top of the cliff none on the beach. Do this as early as you can as it is very hot climbing. Definitely worth seeing. "
Shayan_723,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2019,Hands down one of the most beautiful places one can see. The colors of the water from up above the cliff is mesmerizing to say the least.A must visit place when in Bali/Nusa Penida. Just come prepared with good shoes and water as it can be too hot. 
Happypuppy13,2 contributions,Nov 2019,"Our trip in Nusa Penida was unforgettable moment, thanks to Mustika Nusa Penida Tour especially to Sir Dewarai, very accomodating and he knows the good spot for picture for instagram ! Super thank you kuya ! You're the best ! I will recommend this Mustika Nusa Penida Tour can speak english and very accomodating"
Asriani H,"Makassar, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"The Second time, this still recommended Beach. Clean Beach, Nice Beach, Nice Sunset in Here. Must try to go down. "
Fibaritziamo,"Nympsfield, UK",Aug 2019,"Kelingking Beach is absolutely stunning, but the hike down the mountain path is not for the faint hearted or the unfit.The path down starts of reasonably easy, after 20 mins or so it takes a turn back on its self and then the fun really starts. It was very busy and often grid locked as people are trying to come up at the same time and it is at times very tricky and you have to have 3 point contact. it took us 1 1/2 hrs to get down due to the amount of people coming up. Make sure you take water as on the cliff face it is very hot and if you are like me you is gonna sweat!There is a little stall on the beach selling water, Now foolishly I only took a small amount of water for a family of 4,not very clever! so I had to buy the most expensive water in Bali at 100,000 rps for 2 litres.The beach is stunning and you certainly feel exhilarated when you get to the bottom. The waves are huge and very strong so be very careful.The climb up was quicker as later in day and not many coming down, but one hell of a work out. My leg muscles ached so much I could hardly walk for 2 days. But one of our most memorable days out and we had some great days in Bali and Nusa Penida "
Bodil Fjellrosa,6 contributions,Nov 2019,"It's just to stand in line and wait to have a overlook down on a beach it takes one hour to go down to, in the heat! Overrated. You see it actually better on photos."
federico z,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2019,"Over booked by tourits, abandoned by the local people. The place is just for pictures in the corniche, behind is garbage !!I visited with my parents and they got disappointed cause the entire island doesn't have roads or ways in good shape. The trip for each please takes lot of time, full traffic, roads in bad condition and the worst is there is only 1 sense in the way!The are not clinic or hospitals in case of emergency. Really, this place is a lost town in middle of nothing. No authorities. My suggestion is avoid it at all cost you will spend more time traveling in the car instead of the beaches. "
Catarina Brito,United Kingdom,Sep 2019,The views are beautiful but the roads are super bumpy to get to Kelingking Beach. I would not advise to try and drive a scooter. 100% recommend hiring a driver which is the safest option.It can be very overcrowded and the access to the beach is not in the best condition. We did not go down to the beach but we could see a few people going down the cliff. The driver that was with us suggested that you would need roughly 45 minutes to go down and other 45 minutes to come back up.Be aware there are monkeys on this beach and they are not very friendly.
Weronika J,"Tychy, Poland",Oct 2019,"Worth visiting! Hot as hell though ;) ü§©ü§©ü§© really nice view. Worth the trouble, signs to the place every 1km, nice view point on the left"
Omer sim,"Tel Aviv, Israel",Mar 2019,"Over touristic, but beautiful beach. I didn't go down to the beach itself just took a pic from the cliff."
Mishy On The GC,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2019,"Would highly recommend visiting here if it‚Äôs on tour bucket list. Definitely instagram worthy. The photos don‚Äôt do it justice. We didn‚Äôt do the stairs down to the beach due to personal health, however I‚Äôd you‚Äôre fit and up for it, then it is a must do. "
Liz T,22 contributions,Sep 2019,If you have little time - skip it. Such an overrated trip. Too many tourists and the experience is not worth it - unless you want to go down the beach (very very steep and dangerous and will take you at least an hour)
Nini,Male,Oct 2019,The natural of beauty is always make me feel happier and surprised. If you have chance to visit this land please must be come here and please keep the natural don‚Äôt disturb! 
Indra Yulianto,4 contributions,Oct 2019,amazing place and would like to say thank you to mr fadjar ( mansago travel ). he convince me about this trip.  i choosed 1 day Trip and me and my partner love it.. i will try to stay here for my next vacation. thank you
Tamer Alphonse,9 contributions,Oct 2019,Nusa Penida is such an overrated trip! The boat takes you 45 min from Bali to arrive to the island and you take a car and drive another 45min in the most dangerous and rocky road to just arrive in busy place so you can only take the famous picture! People with kids are highly not recommended to take them all! Avoid this trip by all means!!!
rachana bhapa,"Kullu, India",Sep 2019,I will definitely recommend this place to travellers visiting Nusa Penida. You can combine your tour with angels billalong and broken beach and then head to kelingking point and beach. It is important to note that it is very very steep so wear proper shoes with grip not flip flops and if you have bad knees and then dont get down to the beach. You can go halfway and then come back. Because at some points the steps are very high and narrow and supprted with wooden rails built by travellers on the way. The all the hike is worth it. 
Piyush Thakur,"Pune, India",Oct 2019,"Its a long review but here is what I feel There is a lot of debate on whether you should trek down to the Kelingking beach or not. Lot of vloggers have posted their videos online on the same topic and there are conflicting views on it. For me it was the trek which made all the difference. I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 9:30 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly. Every 5 minutes take a pause and just look around the surroundings , then you will realise why I am asking you to trek down. Once you reach down then you will see an absolutely gorgeous beach with so strong waves . This is what I am talking about. .. This was my best part of Bali trip and I'll come back again to spend atleat 4-5 hours on this beach. Photos don't justify the beauty of this place "
deecorrigan,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2019,A must see if your in this part of the world. Absolutely stunning. The road to get there is terrible. Take plenty of water.
FredBadass,4 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing beach, a must seen place. Hard to acces but 100% worth the effort. Wear shoes, not flip flopes and carefull with childrens and old people "
Andrew S,1 contribution,Oct 2019,"So crowded, long as sketchy hike down to the beach, look at  Instagram or try to go by boat. Everything on Penida is packed with tourists all taking the same photo and the roads are horrible to get everywhere. "
ThomasArabia,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2019,"First of all, its off course a breathtakingly beautiful beach. But that‚Äôs exactly the problem. Its super crowded. The hike:it looks very steep from the top. But its really doable. The first half downwards are proper albeit big steps with proper handrails. That part is safe, although already somewhat exposed. For people who feel a bit afraid here it‚Äôs probably better to turn around at the end of the proper steps, because its getting much steeper afterwards and one needs to scramble down some rocks. There are still handrails, but further down they consist of some lose bamboo sticks only. Overall its not technically difficult, but not for people who are afraid of hwights. It takes around 20 min up or down, if it would be empty. But with people in flipflops (!) and traffic jams it will take longer, and its hot! on the beach is a little kiosk to buy refreshments though."
Amy,64 contributions,Oct 2019,"It took us more than an hour to reach the beach via scooter from the harbor. The road is SKETCHY! Not all of it is paved either. I‚Äôm really glad to have seen this amazing view, and equally glad we got there and back in one piece!Once you get there, there is a pathway that takes you all the way down to the beach. It‚Äôs not an easy trek. Make sure you wear some decent shoes. "
Stefan R,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2019,"My wife and I visited Kelingking as part of a day trip to Nusa Penida during our honeymoon in Bali.Nusa Penida is not as developed as the main islands so be prepared to the tight roads, bumpy roads, and less than stellar views when not at an attraction or sightseeing spot.**Kelingking disclaimer, if you are planning on climbing down to the secret point beach, come prepared with proper shoes, water and snacks for the treacherous trek down and back up the cliff** My wife and I are both fit and avid hikers to the trek down and back up for us wasnt too bad, but you can tell why alot of people either dont do it or get injured going down or coming back up - especially coming back up in the heat or without proper hydration. Overall, it was worth the trip! "
Sophie Rosbill,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,What a gorgeous lovely beach when you‚Äôre down there after going through the steep dodgy steps.. hidden gem indeed!! Worth visiting üòäüòâüëçüèª
333kimberleys,21 contributions,Sep 2019,"Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins) and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot... This is dingy with rats on the rafters and you can select from 2 meals being the cheapest on the menu... This part was private as it was just me and my mum with our driver. Please take travel sickness tablets with you!!! The roads are next level horrible... I've travelled a fair bit and I have never seen roads this bad... I got car sickness in about 15 minutes... And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us. It seems noones safety is considered on this trip and in this day and age it's disappointing that so many people's life's at put at risk to make some money."
treenavel,50 contributions,Sep 2019,"Awesome view, clean great small beach, worth every effort for you to get down and enjoy.It's the most awesome and only place on earth with such beauty!To all able bodies...this is a must visit place once in a lifetime.Plan ahead, arrange car and driver as well as hotel to stay in. Cheap travel by far in comparison to other island but the view alone is worth it!"
looby29,"Carlisle, UK",Nov 2018,Had the pleasure of visiting 2018 was the most amazing place breathtaking.little tip wear good footwear
J.Bas,"Austin, TX",Aug 2019,"breathtaking scenery, awesome blue beach and white sand! Sure it is hard to get down to the beach, very step traditional stairs but once you get there, it is AWESOME"
pip112017,Singapore,Oct 2019,"Absolutely gorgeous views from the top, amazing to watch the sunset from. It‚Äôs definitely do able to hike half way down where there are physical steps to the picture points and get some nice shots. However BE WARNED once you get past the main bit (you will know when) the trail gets INCREDIBLY steep and there are no longer steps, you are from that point on literally rock climbing down an almost upright cliff. In hindsight I would not have gone down as we fell multiple times and was extremely exhausting on the way up. I have cuts on my knees from where I had to essentially crawl up. The beach down there is amazing but you could get access to a beach equally as amazing without the near death experience. If you‚Äôre physically fit and enjoy the thrill of hiking / mountain climbing then go ahead. If you‚Äôre an average person - YOU‚ÄôVE BEEN WARNED!! "
Emmelinem,Emmelinem,Sep 2019,Stunning scenery bit I would recommend going early. We kept getting told off by tourists that we were in their photos. There are way too many people.
Maria Klepikova,3 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing!  One of the most beautiful places of I've seen. It was complocated to get there,  but it worth it"
Cristopher V,"Antwerp, Belgium",Oct 2019,"Incredible view from the cliff, absolutely amazing.From the harbour to Kelingking beach takes 45min-1h by car.Roads are not ready for this volume of tourism. Half of the way was on a too narrow asphalt road, other half was on an even smaller bumpy sand road.Arriving as usual on a parking, local shops leading to the cliff.No safety regulation nor fences to protect you from falling from the 500ft deep cliff.Didnt go down with the stairs as it was too crowded."
Jesel Santos,Philippines,Oct 2019,"The road was terrible, but the view was worth the bumpiness and narrowness of the road. A bit scary if you‚Äôre on the top but once you see the photo you‚Äôll feel relieve. I didn‚Äôt try to go down since i was so scared of the heights. "
L√∂vis G,21 contributions,Oct 2019,"The narrow path leading down to Kelingking Beach challenges you because it is very steep and I wouldn't recommend it for people who are afraid of heights, carry children or don't feel stable on their feet. But also the view from the top of the cliffs at the beginning is very impressive. Ingeneral, it is so rewarding to see the beach, it's thundering waves rolling up unto the sand and just relax in the beautiful white sand under the trees. There are locals selling refreshing drinks and some food which is really nice. You can't really swim there, though, due to the super strong current. Still, if you feel comfortable enough to hike down, you won't regret it!"
Karl Englhofer,Indonesia,Sep 2019,"Hey guys, watch out when you climb down. The climb is not that difficult, but all the other tourists make it dangerous! I went there at sunset. Made a big bonfire and stayed for the night! Milkyway, Shooting stars, waves, Monkeys around. Amazing solo experience. Oh...mind the waves. they took my fire and almost me at 3 am in the morning. So make sure you sleep close to the trees! There are is also a small cave. but i preferred the sky with the stars. :) "
traveljamo,"Watford, UK",Oct 2019,"Absolutely love this place, as soon as i laid eyes on this place it instantly took my breath away, I stood at the top for a good 10 minutes taking it all in.,i got there nice and early about 9 before the mass tourists got there and it was enjoyable, me and my girlfriend decided we would venture down the beach below and wowwww! what an experience it was, my girlfriend doesn't really like heights or hikes so she found it overwhelming, there are certain parts of the climb down which are vertical with big drops which she didn't like.... me on the other hand took it all in my stride so it really does depend who you are with and your fitness level, we got down in about 40 minutes and then spent 2 or so hours on the lovely beach below the waves are massive so only swim if you are confident and strong enough,ild say the climb up is harder than going down... mainly because the heat from the midday or afternoon sun, the amount of people coming down aswell at that time is greater so there's a lot of standing around waiting for people to pass on the tight trail down   there is a bamboo hand rail that goes all the way down, be careful tho in some places this isnt sturdy and its loose!overall I would give this place 9 put of 10,  just be prepared to work for paradise üí™üí™"
paddlepop p,Singapore,Oct 2019,"We came around 10am and it's filled with tourists. Good to come earlier.There are various nice spots for photo taking... There will be queues around it. If u come with your tour guide, they will queue for u.The guide told us it will take 45mins to reach the beach.. At my speed I'll likely take 1.5hours... Hence, I gave up.. And the o it if u intend to spend some time swimming at the beach. There are eateries there.. Just make sure u get all u need before u make the long journey down. "
Jessica C,"Media, PA",Sep 2019,"By far, my favorite tour while in Bali. The view was the most beautiful setting I‚Äôve ever seen. Definitely wear walking shoes. It‚Äôs not exactly a short walk, and if you plan on actually walking down to the beach area you‚Äôre going to wish you can comfortable shoes. Also make sure you have some cash. There are places to purchase water and snacks along the way, and you might need both after climbing the steps in the sun. Overall, amazing...breathtaking...don‚Äôt miss this. "
Teodora,"Bucharest, Romania",Oct 2019,Better off seeing the pictures from Instagram. The road there is very bumpy and dusty... would go again to Nusa Penida...
Larushca F,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2019,"This is one of the most beautiful places to see on nusa penida, it truly is as picture perfect as you see it on the internet. "
Bouy TorQue,"Pattaya, Thailand",Aug 2019,absolutely magical spot. It is very steep at times but slow n steady wins the race. Well worth the effort.The views will blow your mind. Great photos to be taken.
Traveler1234567890,8 contributions,Sep 2019,"The place is spectacular but the climb down to the beach is truly dangerous and takes 35min just to go down. If you plan to go down, do it well before sunset, wear proper shoes and carry enough water - and be really careful! There are some really narrow and steep sections in the trail. The views are great from the top too so you don‚Äôt miss too much if you decide to stay there :)Note that also this nature attraction has an entrance fee. "
Harry Nugraha,"Banjarmasin, Indonesia",Sep 2019,this place is totally awesome!!ride for 30' from GM Bungalows. you can use car with local guide but the road is small. 
satish k,"Hyderabad District, India",Aug 2019,"I had booked for speed boat from sanur for 3,50,000 IDR to reach Nusa Penida . The boat journey takes around 40-45 minutes and i arrived in Nusa Penida around 10 am and i rented a motorcycle for 70,000 IDR and started my ride towards Kelingking beach . First the road to reach the beach has some terrible potholes and some places there is steep slopes so its always safer to ride your motorcycles wearing helmets and also ride at decent speeds . You have to pay parking ticket once you reach the beach to park your bike . The view from the top is simply stunning . It takes almost 30 minutes to go down and its very tough if you are trying to do that around noon time in hot and humid conditions so its advisable for people who want to go down to the beach to carry lots of water to keep themselves hydrated . i was struggling with dehydration when climbing back as i didn't carry water bottle . Few tourist just take pics from the top but the real beauty is the beach if you had made all the way to the top then take that extra 2 hours and go down to the beach and have the best view ."
Fioo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"To be honest, this beach is one of the best beaches i‚Äôve ever visited. Kelingking beach has a super beautiful view with white sands. You guys definitely use sneakers to hike down, because the path is too steep. I don‚Äôt recommend you bringing children or parents as cliff very dangerous. And you need to be healthy. Don‚Äôt forget to bring much water. Five stars for Kelingking Beach!"
Tim,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2019,"One word for this spot, FABULOUS!It‚Äôs possible to go down all the way to the beach. Approximately 30 minutes down and 60 up again. Be there early to avoid the massive crowds."
Natasha U,6 contributions,Sep 2019,"Usually crowed! but if you have a tour guide they just know what to do, just give them your camera  üòä There are restaurants/cafes close by so you can spend a good amount of time there or maybe catch a sunrise here...the beach is just as magical"
Joyce Van der Auwera,"Tremelo, Belgium",Sep 2019,"It was an amazing view! You have to walk a little bit higher and further away from all the tourist and you have an amazing silence view! You can walk down too a very nice beach! We didn't do it because there was a line to get down.. You have to go early! Friends off us did it, it would be a 30 min walk. Also would recommend to go from a boat and take a tour around the island then you can see tis rock as a T-rex very awesome! "
Sebastian,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"It was fun, worth going down and climbing up. The beach is literally the most beautiful one i've ever visited.Feels like having a leg day.Go for a swim there. Its so refreshing"
putuhariw,6 contributions,Sep 2019,I recommend this to be your trip.The service is very satisfying.This is the wonder of the world.enjoyy
travellorandy,"Mainz, Germany",Oct 2018,"Although it was a bit crowdy, it was an awesome experience and adventure. The trail to the Beach might be a bit dangerous but its definitily worth it."
taggmontreal,"Tucson, AZ",Sep 2019,A must see if you are visiting Nusa Penida. Just be careful when there‚Äôs lots of people could be dangerous. I didn‚Äôt do the hike down to beach as it‚Äôs 2 hrs up and down with very steep steps. 
Jillian B,"Victoria, Canada",May 2019,"To start, go early... like seriously the crowds are extreme and I get it. It was magical place but the hike itself is quite treacherous!! Now not everyone at the top goes down (1 blessing) most turn around once they have snapped their shot and go back up... but if you're going all the way to the bottom, go early in the day!** PLLLLLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, don't do this in your flip flops or your cute little instagram worthy wedges. We saw you, you looked cute but hell its not worth falling off a cliff for!I would advise against this if you have any fear of heights. One of the girls in our party was and the trip back up was even harder than the way down. We even picked up an extra in our group when a girl started to panic and her friends left her. The path is super narrow (passing is not always an option). its not flat and well ""groomed"", this is Bali not Hawaii! I mean I was impressed with the handrails they had half the way down, until they stopped and the original ones that don't hold a fly started again. I 100% think it was worth it but as long as you know what you are signing up for, but I don't think it would be worth the another trip back down. I don't feel like testing out my medical insurance. Now the beach, the beach is absolutely gorgeous and I'm a strong swimmer but even that was deceiving. So if you aren't a confident swimmer, don't go in... again your on vacation stay happy and safe!"
AmigaSL,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Sep 2019,Amazing view. Bit dangerous. Make sure to wear shoes. Dusty. Highly recommended place to visit in Bali Nusa Penida.
MJL,"Brooklyn, NY",Sep 2019,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn. Beautiful as it is, this attraction is going to make headlines for all the wrong reasons if responsible action is not taken soon."
Diana Klimova,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Aug 2019,Very nice place to see - ocean & view are breathtaking! Highly recommended place to visit! Just be aware - it‚Äôs very crowded place & monkeys are hiding around so keep eye on your belongings. 
combat_wombat86,"High Wycombe, UK",Sep 2019,"Our tour guide bought us here - of course we were familiar with its image on Instagram already but also knew about the dangerous hike down.Few photos, couple of temples and the odd monkey. That path down though - I‚Äôm scared of falling so hated seeing the edge or my wife near the edge.  I chickened out early but I‚Äôm sure the climb down would be worth the climb up.We walked round to the other headland where you can take yet more photos if you have the time Worth going to - shame so many of us tourists are around to spoil the view!!"
valerie k,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"It was the hardest descent I‚Äôve ever had, and I was wearing a dress (bad decision) but the beach is so amazing. You should go down if you go here, I personally recommend you to spend a day here, and go back up after sunset "
Ezra I F,"Bontang, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"I cannot say enough about the spectacular view of this place. Even from one place to other is hard to reach, the view is worthed it.Did not try to go to the beach but from above it is look really clean. Too much tourist and people taking photo make this place less natural I think."
Andrea,6 contributions,Sep 2019,Amazing experience. The beach and the way down was so worth it. Be careful though. And wear comfortable shoes. 
Anupam S,47 contributions,Sep 2019,Went to the beach in the evening. It was more than beautiful. Couldn‚Äôt go down to beach as we didn‚Äôt have much time. But the view from top is awesome. Endless blue water and crystal clear white sand beaches. But was little crowded due to people busy clicking selfies and photo. Nevertheless one should definitely visit. Just be wary of the roads.
Martijn89,"Hulst, The Netherlands",Sep 2019,"It‚Äôs a beauty, it truly is. But to be honest; it‚Äôs better on photos. It is so busy that it‚Äôs hard to find a good spot to enjoy the view. And a true magnet for insta-photographers trying to add an ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù selfie to their album. Coming early really pays off. Soms restaurants and toilets nearby, nothing really special or clean. Fee to get in was 5000 idr per vehicle which is cheap, but make sure you have it on you. "
chins01,"Brooklyn, NY",Aug 2019,The view was beautiful but I'd recommend going somewhere else as the island has a lot of beautiful views and beaches. When we went there were hoards of people who came purely to take instagram photos and not to enjoy the actual location.¬† It was so crowded with people posing for photos you could barely walk. We ended up leaving quickly and heading to a different beach instead.
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"We went to Kelingking as part of one day tour to Nusa Penida Island so we had limited time for this place unfortunately. I would have rather skipped cristal Bay and stayed for a swim here, however the tour guys have organized the trip in a different way.You do need half an hour maybe to reach the beach down and half and hour to go up. But it‚Äôs worth it for sure!!! "
Raimonds R,"Riga, Latvia",Sep 2019,"Very nice beach for making photos. Rock, stone, some sandy parts. Country roads with pits leads to this beach. Roads under construction in many places. No dislikes. Liked everything."
Charlie W,"Bundaberg, Australia",Aug 2019,"This view is insane. Just as it is seen on Instagram the view is incredible. There was quite a few people but it didn‚Äôt stop anyone from taking any photos and there was no queuing.Some people were waiting to get down to the beach, but the view is what you must come for. It takes a while to get here because the roads are too narrow for 2 way traffic, so plan to have enough time."
Natalie C,"Hinckley, UK",Aug 2019,"Advise going earlier to this location as it can get very busy but it was a beautiful view and people were generally very patient, even with a friend that was quite afraid of heights taking her time going down the stairs. "
Sam B,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,Beautiful spot. Make sure to look at the surrounds as well as the main attraction.The road into any Penida attraction is really rough so be prepared but it's lovely
Em23,"Essex, UK",Aug 2019,"Be warned this place is hard to get too only come by scooter if you are experienced with hills and turns, lots of pot holes ect we saw 4 separate accidents on the way people with bleeding legs, fallen off the bikes The views are stunning didn‚Äôt hike down as there were 100000‚Äôs of people taking photos making it unsafe as they have no idea what‚Äôs going on around them and could easily make you feel uneasyLots and lots of restaurants I believe they all only take cash It‚Äôs more expensive up there 15,000 for water 30,000 for ice cream 5,000 entrance / parking fee Stunning views very busy!!!Around an hour from nusa penida harbour to here and It‚Äôs another 30 minutes drive roughly to Angel‚Äôs billabong afterwards with even worse horrendous roads and for long stretches."
han5da,"Leoben, Austria",Aug 2019,Crazy as hell when the the people start shouting at each other because they want to take a photo. The beach is amazing but tourism is going to destroy everything near this breathtaking location
Rose Kuruvilla,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,"This is probably my favourite view of a beach in Nusa Penida. It is shaped like a t-rex. To take photos, your guide will offer to climb a tree to snap a shot of you and the beach. Simply stunning. We didn't get to go down to the beach as we had a 2 year old and the hike down is difficult. So we just enjoyed the view from the top."
Varghese N,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Jul 2019,"Blue sea with giant fish tail like island Recommend to spend a whole day in this island, 1 hour trekking down and up each, take some food and drink Goethe day when you go down, extremely clear water and beautiful sun set "
aries_92,"Bournemouth, UK",Aug 2019,"Very beautiful destination to visit but just prayed on tourists. There‚Äôs restaurants and ice cream shops all over the place which kind of takes away the beauty and natural feel to this place. I understand that Balinese people are going to make the most of tourists here, but it just wasn‚Äôt what I was expecting. You are charged for everything, parking/photos/toilets etc. We didn‚Äôt do the walk down to the beach as it was too busy. But looked beautiful. We watched manta rays from the cliff which was amazing. "
Laurent B,"Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre, France",Aug 2019,Incredible view... And the gift : monkeys... But it's not so easy.Never try to swim here... It's to dangerous due to hudge current.
catrine law,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2019,"amazing trip while in Asia, an unspoiled place with beautiful scenery, don't forget to visit this place if you visit nusa penida.100% I recommend."
loveylavazza,"Padangbai, Indonesia",Aug 2019,Definitely worth seeing. Very beautiful coastline. Can pay 50c each and go to look out for best views and photos. The road to the beauty spots was terrible. Not tarred and very corrugated rough road
Inge R,"Mechelen, Belgium",Aug 2019,"Pretty sight... if you are willing to stand between 100's of tourists, just for a pretty picture. Don't go there, spend your time somewhere else and look up the picture on instagram, there must be plenty of them..."
Viviana Marin B,44 contributions,Aug 2019,One of the beautiful and unique places of Nusa Penida. The view is gorgeous. If you really want to go down you will have to be prepared physically because it is not for everyone. The way up and down can be hard. So it can take time. But if you decide to stay up the view makes the visit more then worthwhile. 
jamesbolton,2 contributions,Aug 2019,great viewpoint. I recommend to go early in the morning before it gets too bussy and specially if you want to go down to the beach
Inwanderment,"Leamington Spa, UK",Aug 2019,So many steps!!!! We went down one flight and then skipped the others haha! But the view is beautiful and you can get some amazing photos from the top :) 
Audrey C,6 contributions,Aug 2019,"The hike is not for the faint-hearted, but the beach once you get down is a million times worth it! The most beautiful beach I have ever encountered, we were greeted by huge waves and just an absolutely unbelievable location. An absolute must if you are on the island and fit enough to complete the hike. "
Daniel W,30 contributions,Aug 2019,"Yes the view is amazing... BUT ... this place is very very dangerous. You have 100s of people on one thin path along the edge of the cliff.  There is only a makeshift wooden fence tied together with string to stop you from falling.  I would not recommend going.  It's terrible that people are willing to take more and more tourists every day, but nobody is willing to take action to make the place safe for people.  In addition there are monkeys up there running free which isn't ideal when you are so near to cliff edge."
Billie_Gin,"Athens, Greece",Aug 2019,A perfect view - crystal clear waters and white sand. If you want you can go to beach (downstairs 45 minutes upstair 1+ hour). The stairs were extremely busy but this is to be expected at such a popular attraction. Many people and tour guides who takes them pictures.
Lina robert,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"the best tourist destinations in Asia that I have visited after Thailand and Japan. There are still many other places that I have not visited, according to the beach or the information is also quite good and worth a visit"
Thubelihle N,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"Perfect. I enjoyed the hike down took about 45 min it can be less if you fast. And coming back up took 20, the view is majestically. Really loved it very advisable just wear good shoes for good grip coz it‚Äôs steep and a Lil slippery "
Inspiration607193,3 contributions,Aug 2019,"A stunning view - crystal clear waters and white sand. The stairs were extremely busy but this is to be expected at such a popular attraction. Also, the area is good for monkey watching if that‚Äôs your thing! Lots of Warungs to eat also. "
mickl,Germany,Aug 2019,"a natural and beautiful place, like living in heaven, you can go down to relax accompanied by the waves and the sun"
Paulina Perrucci,"Los Gatos, CA",Jul 2019,"I thought getting there at 9:30am would have been ideal, but there were so many people.  It is one narrow little path way to a stunning view point. You can even see people walking on the beach.  Since it is right by the island port, it's a very popular tourist attraction.  I would say go early in the morning."
JKain21,"Orewa, New Zealand",Aug 2019,"Such a beautiful beach! We visited as a part of a tour and I wish we had just made a day of this so we could have made the hike down to the beach, our guide told us it was 45mins down and 1.5hours back up. We got to see dolphins and Manta Rays swim past, so cool! The only sad thing is the road to get here, it very dumpy and I would not recommend using a scooter especially with 2 people. They definitely have set the island up for tourism. "
SabySG,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2019,"I've been hearing so many things about Nusa Penida that I decided to give it a try, but I'm really not sure why everyone is so excited about this, it's overcrowded wherever you go and you have to pay to just enjoy the view, e.g. for Kelingking, which is a total rip off. The road there is super bumpy and it's a long ride, and at the end you have to queue to take a picture - ridiculous! Will not go back and don't recommend it. I really don't know why people make such a fuss about it, I think it's not worth it - stay away! Also, it's super dirty, lots of plastic everywhere you go. Sad."
Loekito1824,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Must visit place when go to Nusa Penida. You won't be disappointed with the view. Great Place to take picture too. Regardless the road is very bumpy and quite far from the jetty, it's worth your effort. If you have much time you can walk down to the beach, need around 45mins to go down. However the path is not good and quite steep. You have to walk slowly to avoid any injuries. It's a great experience if you have time to go down, because according to the local guide this beach if the best beach at Nusa Penida. The water is clear and the sand is not rough."
storm s,37 contributions,Aug 2019,"We were taken away by this beautiful t Rex shaped beach in Bali. The beautiful sand,  clear blue waters and mantas made it an incredible experience. Water gets deep quickly, with big waves and current - perfect if you love body surfing.  Beware!  Getting to this beach is not for the faint hearted and requires a decent level of fitness to get up and down - as the track is underdeveloped and some places you need to rock climb to get back up. Well worth it though!"
Khaulah Naadiya,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jul 2019,"The view of Kelingking from above is amazing. It‚Äôs getting better once you go down and play in the beach. The water is so blue and there isn‚Äôt that many people since the way to go down is quite extreme. There are spots where you only have a space for ur feet so i think its better to go there in pair or ask people on the way for help. Going up from the beach is another story, its practically rock climb. But its all worth the pain!"
emma,World,Aug 2019,"The road to kelingking by motor or car is rough anyways, I can say that 70% of the road was fine and the rest was unpaved rough road. The scene is definitely very beautiful, simply amazing. From the top you can see amazing views of the beach and you can even spot manta ray fish, we could see at least 4. Then we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so we can swim in beautiful turquoise sea and play in the white soft sand. However, there was almost no stairs, it was more similar to climbing a rocky mountain, it was very steep, long, and challenging. Wearing a shoe for this hike is a must. The first half of the broken stairs was fine but the other half was definitely harder, no stairs, only broken rocks to step on. I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs. After finally reaching the bottom, it was all still beautiful, but the sea was also rough, high waves and strong tide, so it was hard to relax in the sea. In the beach there was only one small place selling some drinks and snacks. Overall, it was definitely very beautiful, the view and scene was amazing. The challenge is a bit hard but worth it and we all felt great after doing all this. I would give it 5 stars if only it was better maintained (stairs and facilities) considering the amount of tourists that come to this place. Otherwise its beautiful."
Heena Kapoor,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2019,"The place is located in 'Nusa Penida', an island almost 45 minutes from Bali via sea route. The water is three brilliant shades of blue... The beach is absolutely beautiful!"
nailaatikkhan,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jun 2019,"The views of Kelingking from the top are amazing. But it can be really busy at points, which takes away from the tranquility. You will be surrounded by lots of people taking photos and dangling over the edge for the shot, which can get a little unsafe. The beach is not easily accessible."
Pioneer826629,"Madrid, Spain",May 2019,I came here with my boyfriend and we found it amazing. I would say it is a bit dangerous for children but if you are adventurous this is your dream beach.
krys_k,"London, UK",Jul 2019,"Great view from the whatever angle you look at it. One thing that I learnt from 6 days on Nusa Penida is that if you want to see anything without crowds you need to head of in the morning, preferably as the sun rises whilst folks are having breakfast. The alternative, as it was here, is to battle through traffic jams (on a small island!), and encounter queues (to get onto the track down to the beach). The area on approach to the entrance is too built up with business, some blaring out max volume Beyonc√© (I‚Äôm sure that even Beyonc√© wouldn‚Äôt agree). However, walking up the cliffs means you loose the crowds and get some fantastic views pretty much to yourselves. "
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",Aug 2019,"Absolutely breathtaking views that were amazing! It is extremely busy with tourists and the drive up the mountain is quite windy, but it is not to be missed. If you're coming to nusa penida I would highly highly highly recommend that you do not take a scooter. The roads are extremely bumpy narrow and even an experienced scooter driver would have trouble navigating the thin, steep, uneven roads. The number of tourists that I seen with completely scraped up legs arms limbs, literally bloody from accidents was unbelievable. Take the safer route drive up the mountain with experience locals in an AC car. Honestly these views were something that took my breath away it was so unbelievably beautiful. Taking a picture here makes you look like a professional photographer without even using any filter, Etc. That is how beautiful this place really is!"
DaHappyCat,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"The lookout spot you see in all the typical photos is about a 4 minute walk from the carpark. If you have a tour guide / driver they will be happy to take all the photos for you. They even climb trees to get the best angles. On the day I went we waited about 5-10 minutes to get our photo, but assume on super busy day (or in a couple of years when it gets more popular) it will end up taking a long time to get the photos. You can walk down the stairs to get to beach as well."
Stuart D,"Birmingham, UK",Jul 2019,Amazing beach .... it's a long way down (cold take 45mins down the steps) but amazing experience. highly recommended
Juan Juanes,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2019,"Beach and view was amazing.It was bit adventures to get in to the beach from top. But we did it !!!Spend time enjoying, great time. one of best experience we had in our holiday in Bali !"
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,"No words to describe this place...just serenity at its best...The beaches in Nusa penida are so unique,you cannot miss anyone of them. Do visit and enjoy .The trek to Trex is quite tough,only for daredevils...but the green turquoise color of water just makes your travel memory set apart."
Umang A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,The view from the top is amazing here and you see the t rex head. Walk is difficult and suggest to avoid flipflops.
Seema,"Pokhara, Nepal",Jul 2019,You have to take a cruise to Nusa Panida to see this place. It is very nice- different kinda of beach I have ever been to. I was told takes 2 hours to get down and back up. We took picture from up as we did not had much time. 
Darcy Gomas,"Paris, France",Jun 2019,It was an amazing experience during our holiday in Bali. Island and scenery was so nice. We had a great time. My kids enjoyed a lot. Recommended for families and all type of visitors.
Aswad Miah,"London, UK",Sep 2018,"I would recommend anyone to have Nusa Penida Island tour as a must day trip activity if you visit Bali. The whole Island is amazing however, when we visited it was a little bit overcrowded. "
Franko A,"Acapulco, Mexico",Jul 2019,The view is incredibly amazing in every spot but the path to get down to the beach is very dangerous and it takes a long time to get out of it.  
H M,84 contributions,Jul 2019,"We were staying in Seminyak when we took a day trip to Nusa Penida. It was easy to get around with a driver, but getting from one place to another takes a long time. We were able to go to 3-4 places on the island, and Kelingking was one of them. It‚Äôs better in person than in pictures... the colors of the water are incredible. But there were a lot of people at the top taking pictures, pretty much from the same spot. Some people climb down, but the way down is not the safest/easiest."
Ryan,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jun 2019,"Keling king beach is as crazy beautiful as any of these photos show. It's rather crowded, with everyone trying to get a good Instagram photo (as much of Bali is these days) but it's still off the radar of most travelers. And the rest of the island is even more so - most people still visit for a day trip. And that's their loss. Nusa Penida lacks the amenities and entertainment of Bali, but it puts Bali's beaches to shame. Absolutely great for hiking, sight seeing, and quiet relaxation. I strongly suggest staying on Penida and touring the island for a few days. Just be careful getting around as the roads are in dire shape."
Zahra Prem Akasha,"Paris, France",Jul 2019,Its a wonderful and magic view... be carful with the stairs but to visit absolutely if you go to Penida 
Mochamad Dwi Ergianto,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"This one is my favourite beach all around Bali. Not so many people try to go down to the beach, the track is quiet hard and long (10-20 minutes)."
Inga029,"Vilnius County, Lithuania",Jul 2019,"We really enjoyed the view, but it was very crowded. If you want to go down it‚Äôs not the easy path. So we ended up just viewing from top. "
Nishadi L,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2019,Beautiful views and great photo opps but if you want to get the beach (climb down heaps of stairs) you‚Äôll have to wait a while because this location is always so crowded. I preferred the east coast of nusa penida because there were less people (especially if you go there early) and you could have the beach almost all to yourself 
Rahmat,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",Jul 2019,Kelingking beach one of the place recommended to visit. Even far from Bali but Everything is paid after you be there.
Miriam V,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2019,"Went to see this spectacular view because it‚Äôs so known. Did not disappoint! Just had about 20 minutes since we only had one day to do sightseeing on Nusa Penida, so we only got to see it from the top. Used my drone to capture some great pictures, so it was fine in the end. The roads to get to this place is awful, the road is really bumpy and takes about an hour from the harbour- but in the end the view is worth it. Crowded, so would recommend you come early. "
Ashakani,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2019,The road to this beach is very bad.four wheeler is better idea to go there.the upper view of the beach is spectacular.we can go down the main Beach area for feeling the water but it's a 45min hike down
Matt C,"Bury St. Edmunds, UK",Jul 2019,"View aside, the journey just to get there is quite something. Not for the faint hearted if driving round blind bends is not your thingBut be assured once you arrive it's unlikely you'll have seen anything quite like this place Very very busy and the route down to the beach is tight and equally as busyKeep an eye out for the monkeys too!!"
Stephanie M,"Belfast, UK",Jul 2019,"This view is amazing! We even saw manta rays! We didn‚Äôt go down the steps to the beach though because it was far too busy and no one was actually moving on the steps! The roads to get to it are difficult to ride a moped on, and I assume a car would be very bumpy too! But the view was worth it in the end!"
Joe M,160 contributions,Jun 2019,"take the famous instagram and facebook shot here in kelingking beach. With several walk from the parking area, you can already pose in the famous scene. if you have time, do take a quick tracking down the cliff. worth the time and penny. catch the sunset here and leave memories behind. "
Chris H,"Bournemouth, UK",Jul 2019,"Nusa Penida as an island is beautiful, Kelingking Beach is something else. The most mesmerising place I have ever visited. The height of the cliffs, crossed with the sculpture of the land and that blue ocean just creates the most perfect view. We stood and watched as Mantra Rays swam just off of the beach. Simple perfect I would travel to the island again just to see this!"
Irma Andyana,"Pontianak, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"it's in Nusa Penida Island near Bali.worth to visit when in Bali. Great view, fresh air, and new experience. but you have to queue to take the photo haha. if you traveling with tour guide he will help you take the pic. I didn't go down to the beach, but i will love to someday."
Rickard L,"Kungalv, Sweden",Jul 2019,Perfect postcard photos üòäThey have restaurants and toilets so all you need is cash (no one takes card!)
raidzwan,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Jul 2019,"-choose either package or by yourself -i doit myself-gojek from hotel kuta to sanur-buy return boat sanur-penida at idr300k-rent motorcycle at idr80k-parking for all place +- (idr 30k)-lunch at sebuluh restaurant (+- idr 100k) 1personBumpy road,small road,but great view"
Ansu Thankam J,"Vellore, India",Jul 2019,"Kelingking beach was our first destination in Nusa penida.It was quite a long journey from the harbour.We were greeted by a very cheerful guide.We reached the cliff top.There's very clean tea shop on the top, provides great tea and snacks, clean restrooms were available. The view from top is breathtaking. We clicked pics. We trekked down to the beach. However the trek was very steep and dangerous,we realized that only half way through and it was too late to climb back up. It's literally rock climbing,so be ready for a proper trek. I would advise against taking kids along. Anyhow what lies beneath is worth the trouble. We had packed some granola bars and juice packets which saved the energy to climb back. It was near noon and was too sunny and terribly hot. Thinking back now we felt it was not a safe idea,a good adventure,a great memory."
fayemurphy,"Cork, Ireland",Jun 2019,"We arrived here at approximately 9am and were one of the first groups there. By the time we left, 45 minutes later, there were significantly more tourists, already making it difficult to enjoy the beauty of the place without an elbow in the face. Members of our group weren't keen on walking all the way down to the beach but I did go some of the way down and deeply regret not going all the way. I think it is something extremely worthwhile and doesn't seem very treacherous to do. Good walking shoes are an essential if going all the way down though and I would imagine it is not very suitable for young children as it can get very steep. Also, beware of your valuables as there are monkeys wandering around!"
DaJanss,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2019,"nice to make a trip and to snorkel. If you visit the island, it's a must to snorkel to see the beautiful underwater life.One disadvantage: so popular, that it feels overcrowded by tourists"
Nusa Penida Tour,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Jul 2019,Kelingking beach located in west nusa penida need 45 minute from banjar nyuh port. But the view workit and amazing. If you go to nusa penida you must visit this place‚ù§Ô∏è
erika p,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2019,"Nusa Penida is a relatively undeveloped tourist destination, therefore roads and other facilities are in their infancy and are struggling to satisfy the needs of tourists. However the unspoilt scenery, friendly locals and spectacular sights make it worthwhile. Careful management is required to retain the rugged attractions and make access safe. Doing your homework of any place one visits is a MUST to avoid drawing inappropriate conclusions."
Jaster N,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,It's a must visit beach when you are in Nusa Penida. We went in the late afternoon by scooter and it wasn't crowd. Hiking down seriously not for the weak hearts! The roads indeed not for beginner riders. Way too bumpy and rocky but it's definitely worth it!
DiianEviita,"Kuta, Indonesia",Jul 2019,So beautiful beach..and i hope this beach still be a recomend beach in bali.because i love bali  .. Always love my born place
Mohammed M,"Manama, Bahrain",Jul 2019,"We‚Äôve reached this location after a horrendous boat ride with waves pounding the boat. Reaching to Kelingking beach required a tiring 40 minutes ride on semi-paved roads. The scene is breath taking. But overall all, I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth it. The tours also include other beaches/cliffs with the same bumpy ride that will drain you for the day. I‚Äôve wasted my time (and money) to be honest."
Susie B,"Rolleston, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Visited this beach after enduring a boat ride that had to be boarded on the beach. With the waves pounding the beach it was quite a scary encounter to get on board. To get to the beach we had a driver who took us over some horrendous roads that caused me to have a sore back for several weeks. When we got there to view the beach it was loverly but as usual crowded with lots of people. I definitely wouldn‚Äôt be going back. I felt sorry for the people who hired scooters. The roads were bad enough in the car.  The roads were horrendous all over the island. Not what I would call a pleasant visit. The boat trip going back we had to get off the boat at the beach with the same difficulty. 
MasterJohn316_,1 contribution,Jul 2019,Beautiful scenery! My guides Ketut putra & gd maha were exceptional! Couldn‚Äôt ask for anyone better.
Aakila Ayman Mohamed Ismail,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,Kelingking Beach is the main highlight in Nusa Penida. It was the most awesome beached I have ever been. Be extra careful if you decide to trek down the cliff.
tacaram,Brisbane,Jun 2019,The pictures really don't do this place justice.  The view is beautiful.  We didn't walk/climb all the way down to the beach but did manage to go part way to appreciate the amazing scenery.  It does get busy/popular but you can still get chance for photos and to appreciate the views. Recommend sturdy shoes if you are going to climb down to the beach - the walk is more like trekking/rock climbing at times.
Luciano D,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",May 2019,"please go down to the beach, totally worth it. It takes way too long (about 40 minutes) to go down and another 40 minutes to go up mainly because of the people and the very narrow pass. And of course save keep some hours to enjoy the beach. Best place in all west Nusa"
Zbenda,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,"The best experience of our holiday in Bali. You have to have a good condition because access is quite hard. But it‚Äôs amazing. Don‚Äôt be lazy, take your time and go down. But be careful! "
Colleen,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2019,"Although there is quite a journey to get here from mainland Bali, a car, a boat, a tuc-tuc, a car....a very broken beat up road and then paradise! So worth it. Breathtaking views, stunning blue ocean. Pictures do not do this place justice."
samchy,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019,"This place is beautiful, words can‚Äôt describe it. Great for walking, scenaries like in movies and most of all fun. The locals are really friendly and I am so glad I visited it. Be wary the roads in Nusa Panida are quite bad though and a lot of bumps and journey can be uncomfortable but it‚Äôs well worth it. "
Chen Wei Li,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Visit this place by yourself and be amaze üòÑ ..cheap entrance ticket only 5k idr per person, although the roadtrip to this place might be extreme for several person but when you arrive there, all r worth it"
samantha,10 contributions,Jul 2019,Our guide Maha was amazing! He used our camera better than we could to get some epic pictures. The roads were a bit rough but the driver did an excellent job and the time at the swimming beach was great. Overall I couldn‚Äôt recommend this tour enough!
Lidya Setiawati,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"It was very beautiful beach, nice view with the blue ocean. To reach the Kelingking Beach, it has to go down the cliff. Must be careful because it is very steep and slippery. It takes time about 40 minutes. But the struggles paid off when get down, because the beach is very nice."
Sadicay,257 contributions,Jun 2019,"Another beautiful view, the T rex like formation is one of a kind.The crowd is starting to pour when we came, but still able to get few decent photos.We didnt go down and just enjoyed the view from the top. There are some tourists swimming. Per our tour guide is 20 mins hike down, but going up may take longer depending on the person.For those who wanted to go down and swim, day tour is not enough."
Francesca S,43 contributions,Jun 2019,Go early as the busloads of tourists arrive around 9am. The walk down is a bit intimidating but the views are incredible. You can see mantas down below in the clear water.
suvi1983,111 contributions,Jun 2019,"We visited the Klingking beach first straight after getting off the ferry from Sanur to Nusa Penida. It was noon when we reached the beach and it was HOT. But the view was as breathtaking as one would hope. Stunning!! The view was way better than any of the Instagram pictures I had seen. We probable spent about 30 minutes there taking pictures and then went to our next destination. Be sure to wear comfortable footwear as the roads are definitely not walkable in heels ladies!! You don't need shoes, just any comfortable footwear ought to do."
Drey Liautaud,1 contribution,Jun 2019,"This was a phenomenal experience, the photos will be excellent and your insta pic will be poppin. But understand that the hike is no piece of cake so come prepared with the right footwear and know your limits. If you haven‚Äôt done strenuous physical activity in awhile it might not be for you. It‚Äôs a lot of climbing and oftentimes you are almost vertical. Unprepared travelers put everyone at risk given the way the track down is structured at points."
Nathalie DW,"Saint Nicolas, Belgium",May 2019,"must visit when on Nusa Penida !  be careful when taking scooter, the road is tricky to drive ! And in the meantime the place is overrun with day trippers from Bali but still too beautiful to be missed."
Sumedh Shinde,"Pune, India",Jun 2019,The tour is one of the best ones. The island has its own beauty. Our guide Mr. Manku Su was a very nice person and highly recommend to go with him. 
steve p,"Nottinghamshire, UK",Jun 2019,"The view from the top is amazing, the view from the beach is equally nice but it's just another blue sea photo from the beach really. If you plan to go to the beach please heed the other reviews that recommend decent footwear and clothing and a certain level of physical fitness. It's hard going, especially on the way up...and please take your rubbish with you, unlike the Brazilian/ Portugese couple today that just threw their plastic bottle into the undergrowth when the going got too tough for their Instagram clothing, make up and flip flops....people like you are a disgrace, give tourists a bad name, and are a danger to others in places like this! "
thewees,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"So after going one time and not knowing what to expect, this is our tips if we were to do it again.Pack a small backpack so you can have your fitflops with you when you hike down to the beach. It‚Äôs v difficult to do the trail without proper shoes.In the small backpack, we plan to pack some snacks a beach towel plus some water and even beer if the bag isn‚Äôt too heavy!The beach looked so secluded and beautiful from above so I think it‚Äôs definitely worth a climb down. Pencil in the whole day to enjoy this place if you already are exhausting all your energy climbing down. Everyone stops at the top for photos only so if that‚Äôs all you plan to do, go early!We took the tour from Nusa Island Surf School who organised a 7am departure from Nusa Lembongan on boat then to a car once we got to Nusa Penida. We got to Kelingkling beach before 9am, by 10, it was non stop tourist traffic.There are small warungs there so easy to buy water food and beer as well.Have a great time! It‚Äôs an absolute must to see this place :)"
Prothu,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",May 2019,"Me and my husband went there to celebrate our marriage  anniversary.The place is amazing. View is just awesome. The turquoise water attracted both of us and we couldn't hold ourself getting down the beach. It was very risky to go down, very stiff and narrow path. However we went down there and it took about 1 hour. After getting down there you will feel that yes the effort comming down worth it. The big waves and white sands are mind blowing.As the waves were big i didn't dive into but my husband went for swim. Unfortunately i was just standing nearby and feeling the waves touching my feets, suddenly a very stong wave came and just made me fall down. I was not able to getup and within a fraction of second it took me away deep.I thought i was dead. My husband came to fetch me but along with me he was also drowning. Thanks to the other foreign visitors those helped both of us from being drowned. 4 of them dragged both of us simultaneously. It was so dangerous and i was very scared. I'll never forget this accident. So guys please dont swim in high tides not even stand nearby the waves.Thanks to Almighty for saving both of us.Then all of them encouraged us and half an hour later we decided to climb up. It took 1.5 hours to climb up and was too sunny. Very hard to climp up, no shadows , no place to take rest. But the place was really very beautiful. A must visit in Nusa Penida. Suggestions:1. Pls wear sneakers /slippers whatever you feel comfort. We went down there with slipper.2. Hat/Cap3. Plenty of water bottles. Down there 1 500 ml bottle is 30 k IDR4. Chocolate / dry foods5.Dont dive into the sea. "
David C,"Antwerp, Belgium",Jun 2019,"Prepare yourself for a serious climb down to the beach! And allthough  you want to wear slippers, because you‚Äôre going to the beach, we were glad we brought our hiking shoes for the ‚Äòstairs‚Äô downwards. Halfway down the way, people are turning back, because things get tricky. As a result you will spend your time at the beach with only few people, making the experience even better... don‚Äôt think you can take a swim to cool down, cause the waves will drag you right in the water...For those who dare to take on the challenge: enjoy your view!!!"
Emelie J,21 contributions,Jun 2019,"We had the best guide going down, I have astma so needed stop several Times but my other half and guide was so patience with me ‚ò∫Ô∏è best guide ever, I recommend jpctours on instagram, contact him there. Safe and goodüëå been too Bali two Times ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
Sweta T,bangalore,Apr 2019,this is a beautiful beach with lime stone cliffs in shape of Trex head.nice place. but crowded with tourist.to go to sea one need to climb down a steep way.  
Canadian,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"Honestly, 100 times better if you go while staying on the island and not as a day trip. We arrived around 9 am. Paid 11,000 per two people (including parking scooter)There were only a dozen or so people. Plenty of space to enjoy the view and take pictures. We decided to take the grueling stairs down- I'm not going to lie it is steep! But a nice challenge, if you are looking for a good work out it's worth it. But once we got down we weren't sure the point of heading down. The beach is nice, but you can't swim. So we didn't really see the point of going down in the end. We returned to the top around 11am and there were TONS of people. It was insane, basically a line to get to the edge to take a picture. Coming back up was also brutal but only because there were so many people on the stairs. Overall take home message for us, go in the morning and don't bother with the way down. FYI there are also two other view points further down the road and again no one was there."
Kasia M,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2019,The beach is not easily accessible (we drove a motorbike for 40 minutes from the main Port) but the views are definitely worth the hustle! Unfortunately number of people pushing through the narrow path to get this ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù Instagram picture makes it very difficult to enjoy. We tried to walk down the path but it was too packed to really take to most out of it - I would recommend to go there very early in the morning to avoid the crowds 
Willwork4holiday,111 contributions,Jun 2019,"Having left from Sanur harbour we boarded the fast boat from the beach, you have to wade in up to your thighs to board the back of boat, the trip was smooth and fast with every seat filled on boat.  After about 45 mins we arrived at Nusa Penida, this was onto a proper harbour wall so didn‚Äôt get wet getting off the boat.  We did some snorkelling at Crystal Bay, Gammet Bay and GT wall in a local fisherman outrigger boat.We then got into a 4wd for a lunch stop and drove the long windy road with some of it rough, potholed and unsealed to Klingking beach.  The view makes it all worth while.  Very popular with tourists. It is then back on the unsealed road about an hour drive to Nusa Penida harbour for the 45 min fast boat back to Sanur.  A long day but great tour. "
Taylor,"Southend-on-Sea, UK",Jun 2019,"We travelled 3 boats just to come to this view, and we are so glad we did. We were blessed with an amazing sunset too. We went in the evening so it would be less busy, however where the sun was setting we were unable to hike to the bottom. Many people were coming back up but seemed quite tired and it looked steep, flip flops wouldn‚Äôt be ideal. Well worth the trip for the amazing view."
ramcinty,4 contributions,Jun 2019,"Beautiful hike! Was VERY concerned for safety of some hikers. A few tips:1) no flip flops2) carry water in pack (not in hands, you'll need those)3) yell ""rock"" if one comes loose and falls- keeps those below you safe4) this climb is wildly steep, with some class four scrambles and class five climbing."
Chandr√© B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Getting to Kelingking Beach is not easy. Although the road is being fixed, it is a difficult ride on a scooter if you are not used to driving on rough terrain. The entrance fee once you get there is 5000 IRP per person and 1000 for a scooter. You can take pictures from the the top without the climb. If you decide to descend, be prepared for a difficult climb. We arrived in sandals, and ended up going barefoot instead. Going back you need to use your hands to climb back up. My husband and I are fit, and the 800m ascent back to the top took us just under 30min. The views, and the beach itself, are worth every drop of sweat to get there and back. It really is beautiful and unique. "
Scrumpet,Australia,Jun 2019,"Good luck trying to get past the hoards of people trying to take their selfies. We arrived around 9am and it was crazy We planned to hike halfway down but couldn't get past the people determined to take thousands of photos of themselves, so only made it a quarter of the way. The ""path"" is narrow and steep, so we gave in and hiked around to the right a little for another good view. Also, the 5000 rupiah lookout point had a decent view for those wanting some space"
Melissa V,"Lima, Peru",Jun 2019,"The place is really beautiful and the view is amazing. People can go down if they want, but they have to be really careful. The walking to go down takes 1 hour aprox. I went with my fiance and we decided just to stay on the hill. "
DCozzens,99 contributions,May 2019,"The beach on a sunny day is amazing. Getting to it can be tough, especially if you go mid day. I would strongly suggest getting there early, like sunrise. That way you won't have traffic to get there or crowds to descend with down to the beautiful beach."
Michael,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jun 2019,"Best view in Nusa Penida. The road to Kelingking Beach is one of the worst i have ever seen. Small and super bumpy. Go there early. The bad roads dont allow for much traffic and they will cause traffic congestion very fast. If you are there, simply enjoy the fantastic sea view. The dinosaur-head-shaped rock formation with the golden sand below. Just great. Absolute ""must"" for any Nusa Penida visitor!"
Ricardo Tanada,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Hello allI just have a great visit with my wife to Kelingking - Nusa Penida Island - Bali Indonesia last weekWe stayed at Coco Resort Nusa Pendia and rent a motorcycle to visit Kelingking beach at 7.00 AM.It took around 45 minutes from our hotel to reach there.. the road wasn't good, we spent almost 20 minutes in bad road conditions and finally reached the Kelingking beachThe entrance ticket for local was IDR 5.000, I'm not sure for the foreign tourist price. After parking the motorcycle and walked around 5 minutes we saw an amazing view from top of the Kelingking beach cliff. It was so beautifull, you can see the hidden paradise, clean beach, blue water, beautifull cliff (looks like dinosaurus head, some people said it looks like kelingking finger)We try to go down to the middle of the cliff, it took 15 minutes, because we wasn't have enough time, finally we decided to go back to the topOur recommendations if you want to visit the beach- Prepare at least 3 hours (30 min going down, 30 min going up and 2 hours to enjoy the water)- Wear proper shoes- Go down carefully, it was quite dangerous, some people said ""few months ago one people from Australia falldown from the cliff and died""I would like to give 5 stars for this beautiful nature in Nusa Penida Island, it was amazing!Very worth to visit, and you must see it from your own eyesPicture taken by my lovely camera Olympus OMD EM10 7-14mm lensEnjoy!"
jpglemos,"Geneva, Switzerland",Jun 2019,One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen around the world.Definitely worth seeing even if the road is rough and dangerous 
hunter_travels,9 contributions,Jun 2019,Came here with friends and was not disappointed! The view is way crazier than shown in the pictures and it is an amazing spot. Beware though if you are afraid of heights because the climb down is extremely steep and sketchy. 
Mark S,2 contributions,Jun 2019,"The best sea I have ever been to !The way down was really hard and slippery, the way up was easier. It is totally worth it"
HOLISTIC_HOPE,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"It's truly scenic words can't describe it.Choose low season as during summers it's highly crowded.One needs at least 5 or more hours from harbour to this place, vv and to go down to the beach ...."
zapumal,Singapore,Jun 2019,"It can be really crowded. Went a little early and there was no one. However, around 1030-11, a lot of people turned up. The way down to the beach is rough and poorly maintained. You will need good shoes. Also you will have to stop on the way regularly as others are stopping to take photos. However, only a few tourists go all the way down to the beach!"
wardellkate,"Lismore, Australia",May 2019,We hadn‚Äôt read anything about kelingking so had no idea that there was the hilariously steep climb. The descent was harder partially due to all the instagram photo shoots happening at the top and a flip flop wearing senior citizen who didn‚Äôt let people pass him. I would recommend going down backwards in some areas and make use of the railings/ropes where they exist.The beach at the bottom was amazing . The tide is very strong but there is also a life guard pointing out the less dangerous sections. The climb up is easier than doing down.When we got to the top there were like 10x as many people as when we had started . It seemed like hundreds of minivans had all arrived at once full of people doing day trips over from Bali. If you are staying on Nusa Penida I would ask your driver to take you there early morning or after the day trips will have finished for the day. 
Ilham H,"Machang, Malaysia",May 2019,"It's challenging to go down, more challenging to go up üòÇ But, there's no regret, make sure you wear shoe or just barefoot as it's a rough way down. Don't forget to take pictures and swim there, it's worth it. Very beautiful "
jobiks,"Cairns, Australia",May 2019,The road is rough and long but the view when you get there is beautiful.  Unfortunately it is crowded and busy. There are many small restaurants that have opened to accommodate the ever increasing mass of tourists.  We didn't walk down to the beach due to lack of time. What spoils places like this are the tourists (and maybe locals) who leave their rubbish etc especially cigarette butts behind! Not to mention the stupidity of tourists perched precariously on the edge of the cliff to get that instagram pic!!!.If you are staying on Nusa Penida I think visiting early morning or late afternoon may give you a different experience.  
tessakathleen,11 contributions,May 2019,"The beach here is absolutely beautiful with white sand and clear water. The trail is very steep (nearly vertical in many places) and rough. It has steps cut into the dirt and railings tied together. I saw many people coming down with brown scraped butts and even saw one guy slip and take out the woman in front of him. This trail is not for inexperienced hikers, kids, or elderly. In many places you must rely on the railings for support and in some sections I saw the railings had fallen so take caution. Bring water as it‚Äôs a steep hot hike back up."
Kevin C,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2019,A must visit to this postcard location. Locals say they call it the T-Rex. A day trip to Nusa Penida must include a visit to Kelingking Beach. You can even walk all the way to the beach. Take a selfie stick for those over the edge photos.
amandamay245,1 contribution,Mar 2019,"What a beautiful and amazing place! Yes it is totally worth it to see. One thing you do want to do is get there early. We got there around 8:30am and there weren't too many people hiking down which was nice, we left close to 12 and there was busses of people and tours coming in. The hike down gets really steep pretty much straight up at the bottom. Make sure you are wearing good shoes. It is really not for the out of shape. The gnarliest hike I have ever done! And we are in shape. The beach is serene and amazing and worth it. Also coming back up isnt as bad but it gets really hot bring lots of water."
olivierpelloie,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"To be honest I was worried about the large crowd spoiling this beautiful place, but it turned out to be real amazing. If you want that ‚Äúwow‚Äù feeling, I suggest you go:- on a sunny & clear blue sky day. That‚Äôs when the colours are really mesmerising. - outside of the high season mid-June / September.- all the way down to the beach. Clean sand, fun waves & shorebreak. It‚Äôs very well kept compared to other popular beaches."
departedroyalty,3 contributions,Dec 2018,Extremely beautiful beach. Took a ferry and the hike was worth it! So so beautiful. A sunny day is a plus point! 
Worldexplorew,3 contributions,May 2019,We just enjoyed the view from the top and decided NOT to do the trek down to Kelingking beach as it would mean that we would have to hike back up.  Instead we spent more time at Crystal beach.
Aditya Agrawal,"Raigarh, India",Apr 2019,"We stayed in Kuta and planned one day visit to Nusa Dua. We started with the speed boat which was approx 30-40 minutes ride.On reaching to Nusa Dua we went to the Kelingking Beach, we viewed this from top of the mountain. The view was stunning for us, and we were short of time so were unable to go down the hill to the beach. We regret not being able to go to the beach.It is a nice 3-4 hours activity and the color of water was amazing.Recommended location and day trip for a relaxed experience."
Life with the Singh Sisters,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"The Nusa Penida Island is one of the best tours in Bali, Indonesia. Kelingking beach is on that Island and it is heavenly. It's like you found peace on earth."
daniramasyah,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2019,"Kelingking Beach is a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island. You can enjoy one of the most breath-taking views over the hills and small strip of white sand from atop a hill of the same name. The sight features a limestone headland covered in green, against the deep blue waters of the open Indian Ocean. This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‚ÄòT-Rex Bay‚Äô. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it‚Äôs during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you‚Äôve reached the sand, you‚Äôll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated. You can combine your visit to Kelingking Beach with a visit to an interesting temple nearby. Pura Paluang Temple is a couple of minutes‚Äô ride east by motorbike, and features shrines in the shape of cars!"
Timmi002,"Washington DC, DC",Apr 2019,"This place is absolutely stunning and amazing.  This is THE REASON to come to Nusa Penida.  Totally worth the trouble of taking the boat over from Sanur.  The views from up top are breathtaking.  Expect massive crowds as this is one of Bali's biggest attractions.  If you want to escape the crowds, hike down to the beach.  It takes about an hour to get down and a bit more to come back up.  The path is super steep and not for the faint hearted as you are basically scaling a rock face to get down to the beach. But it's so worth it as the sand is pure and fine, the views are incredible and it's peaceful because only a fraction of the visitors come all the way down. I don't recommend flip flops but most people used just that.  Closed toe shoes that fasten to your feet like water shoes, Tevas, or sneakers would be better.  The bottom is rustic so bring everything you might need with you including water and towel.  Note: I think there was a guy selling water.  Be careful in the water as the waves are crazy.  One knocked me down and I had sand coming out of my ears for days.  But it was super fun.  If you have a sense of adventure, definitely do this!!!"
LionelTT,"Miri, Malaysia",May 2019,"Spotted a manta from the top. Amazing views wherever you step. Path down to the beach is pretty treacherous. I am amazed so many people just start walking and continue down- (herd mentality?? us included!). The tragedy of someone slipping and bringing many others down is too scary to imagine. After our visit, read that a Russian woman fell to her death here in Feb 2018.Saw dads carrying toddlers on their backs, and one did not even have a child carrier! The authorities should really construct a safer route to this magnificent beach.The bay is amazing once you get down. Well worth the climb down and up if you accept the risks. And no, there is no easier way, Ken! :)"
Dani W,2 contributions,May 2019,"The view from the top is spectacular, if you can see past the hordes of Instagrammers who rode up in their air conditioned vans. To get away from the crowd, I decided to do the trek/climb down to the beach, despite a previous guide telling me it was ""very dangerous."" Guys, it's not that bad. Given, I'm a rock climber who's in pretty good shape, but the steps are worn into the rock and the hand railing is solid up until the last maybe 100m, when you should test it before pulling hard. I wouldn't do it in flip flops, but I found my running sandals worked fine -- sneakers would've prevented me from feeling the rock. But if you're scared of heights, have knee problems, or aren't physically fit, probably skip the climb down. At the bottom of the climb is the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. Perfect white sand flecked with pieces of coral, a massive cavern on one side of the beach, and the T-Rex cliff on the other. The waves are big, strong, shore breakers and there is a fairly hefty rip current. If you are not an experienced ocean swimmer I'd suggest staying out of the water; I saw multiple people get thrown onto the coral-flecked shore by a wave, and it didn't look pleasant. If, on other hand, you know what you're doing in the water, get in! The slight danger makes it that much more exciting."
Amit Rane,"Navi Mumbai, India",May 2019,Must visit place in Nusa penidaLess rush before 9 am Lot of tourist between 9 am to 2 pm Good location for sunset too
daisy,"Woking, UK",May 2019,"The view was insane is 100% worth a visit! We did climb it down to the beach which was still stunning but was the hardest climb I‚Äôve ever done in my life, I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs worth it to climb all the way to the bottom as the view is stunning without the climb and without the pain you‚Äôll be in the next day. "
Storm,19 contributions,May 2019,"Well it's a big climb down. The stairs are very steep, so if you're small u will have trouble with them. If u have injuries or just bad condition I wouldn't recommend to climb down. The beach down is one of the best I ever seen. The water and waves a quite rough so it's not suited for bad swimmers. For me the climb up and down was totally worth it! Extra tip: don't come on flip-flops and bring a couple of bottles water with you. Down on the beach they sell, only for way to much money."
William L,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,Last min decision to do a day trip to Nusa Penida and this was one of the unforgettable experience. We took a tour that visit 4 places in Nusa Penida which include the boat trip to the island and car transfer to each site. The downside is that you cant stay too  long at each place around 30mins to 45mins most. If you really want to enjoy Kelingking beach and climb down to the beach it is recommended to get get your own transfer once arrive in the island. The tour I bought was west trip package.from 630am and get back at hotel at 6pm.The road is really bad and its a 40mins super bumpy ride to Kelingking Beach. I would only do it once more time as I didnt get a chance to climb down to the beach. The view was amazing and it is just as what is shown on instagram!! take as many pics as you want and just be safe! It is best to come here early (10am or earlier) to aovid the crowd.
louiseluckie,64 contributions,May 2019,"Honnestly it was the hardest thing I‚Äôve ever done in my life.Be prepared with water and snacks as the water is 50,000 at the bottom.Takes about 30 mins to get down and 40 to get back up- depending on the amount of people you pass on the way. The view at the top is fantastic, a huge instagram hotspot (@louiseluckie), however, the climb down is one I will never do again.Take trainers. You practically climb up and down a vertical cliff, with spaces for your hands and feet. The current at the bottom is also very strong, huge waves drag you out and throw you back onto the shore. Good view from the top, but I wouldn‚Äôt climb back down again."
ECTMRO,"Timisoara, Romania",May 2019,"I'm not young but the effort was Ok.Amazing beach, one time in life to be there. If you are in good condition and your mind is strong you can to go there. Yes it is long path (50min down and 75 min up), yes it is dangerous, yes the effort is huge but on the beach is woow.Recommending 100%!"
mattyskarz,65 contributions,Apr 2019,"This place is literally CRAWLING with people that it is not enjoyable. The hike is steep and people are not prepared in dresses and flip flops for their insta photo shoot that it is  a traffic jam to hike down. It is impossible to even see the beach without a million people in view. The drive to kelingking is arduous, bumpy, and traffic ridden. We would not recommend it to people going to Bali and would not go back."
Theo,"London, UK",Apr 2019,"This is the best of Nusa Penida, you cannot miss this place if you go to Bali and Nusa Penida, no excuse guys! A must, a top photo shoot for Instagram too! It can be overcrowded yes, but my recommendation is to go early in the morning so you will have time to take good picture with a good lights and go all the way down. The water down there is just AMAZING. Best, Theo"
Elizabeth M,1 contribution,May 2019,"If you are in a really good shape, bring water and hiking shoes! Not flip flops!!! It‚Äôs really hard, it‚Äôs not a easy hike!! It‚Äôs not a clear steps, is just rocks... you handles but that pretty much! If you like adventure, push your body and do a lot of exercise this is the place for you!! It‚Äôs worth the hike if you can enjoy... if you are from the Caribbean like me, I don‚Äôt believe is worth the effort for something I can have in 15 min for home no effort!! I believe they need to make the notifications about how hard it is!! I don‚Äôt mean to scared anyone, I just think is better if you know!! It‚Äôs like a 1 hour going down!!"
VanessaMunYee,"Houston, Texas",May 2019,Stunning view from above. However it would be too long to get down to the beach and up again to get to the carpark. We are content just to be on top with the amazing view. Is a must see if you somewhere in Bali.
Balinese_wanderer,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2019,"Super proud being a balinese due to many travellers voted kelingking beach as number one exotic beach in the world, kelingking means pinkie finger (the shape of small island looks like pinkie finger). It is my 5th visit to kelingking beach and this place never failed to amaze me!"
emilykimble03,"Clarksburg, Maryland",Apr 2019,"This Beach is absolutely Beautiful. Most tourists that go here just stay at the top to get a photo. I highly encourage and challenge you to climb down the Mountain and see the Beach from the bottom. It's much more spectacular than you can imagine. Clear sky blue water with white sand and big waves. There are few people so it's relaxing. The journey to get to this beach is worth it. Put in the work and take the climb, I promise you won't be dissapointed. Wear good shoes because the climb is steep and rocky. There is no bathroom so bring wipes/toilet paper and a change of clothes. Drink plenty of water and be sure to bring money with you. There is a stand at the bottom with drinks. Wear Sunscreen!"
Anton K,"Berlin, Germany",Apr 2019,"This beach is one of the best beaches I‚Äôve seen. But it‚Äôs hard to get down and getting back up is even harder. It‚Äôs mainly climbing so wear proper shoes! At the top it‚Äôs very crowded, but as soon you managed to get down you basically got the beach for your own. "
Wilmer L,"Sukawati, Indonesia",May 2019,I vist this place in the island üèùBut is to much peopleOver 1000 people per dayYou can't walk or enjoin the viewThe roads are very dangerousThe worst roads I ever see if it possible to call roadsVery difficult access 
Arek Areckhi,"Szczecin, Poland",May 2019,Wonderful views and long way down to the beach (about hundred meters). Best view on a right side. Just check photos.Ps. the road leading to this place is in very poor condition.  if you do not feel good on a scooter - hire a driver better.Entrance fee: 5k IRD
nellika63,ornskoldsvik,Apr 2019,"Went on a tour with driver around the island and I will never do it again. The roads are very narrow, curvy and bumby. Traffic jam everywhere as traffic can't meet in the roads. We went  around to see the islands best viewpoints, but it was crowded with tourists everywhere.  You have to stand in line to take a photo and for the viewed picture of Kelingking beach you have to climb a three to take a photo. It's a pretty island but if I go again I will get around the island with boat and I think Kelingking beach is great to visit from the sea as well."
Maria Cecilia G,3 contributions,Apr 2019,"This place is amazing. Not only for the views of the beach from the top, the shape of the rocks and the color of the water. You must go down to the beach! It's not an easy road (steep and rocky), but it's really worth it!It's a beach with transparent water waves and there are not many people there. Most of them just go to take the picture from the top (even they do a queue to take the picture! Crazy, but instagram times!). You will not regret of going here, it's a postcard in my mind! :)"
Abbiehorry,"Nottingham, UK",May 2019,Came here and was not disappointed! If you‚Äôre planning on walking down then wear suitable footwear and not sandals. Seen so many people wearing sandals/flip flops which is really dangerous!! Very hard walk but worth it! The road to this place is absolutely awful though. 
Ran Bon,"Pasay, Philippines",Apr 2019,"This place is magical. It has a jaw-dropping, breathtaking, unique view that seems surreal. You won‚Äôt be able to see a place like this in the world."
Arne Z,"Steyr, Austria",Apr 2019,"We went to Kelingking early in the morning to avoid the day tourists which was a good decision. The view is breathtaking, the scenery outstanding. We went down to the beach what was expected to be an easy hike but it was really difficult and dangerous. We are from Austria and used to climbing steep mountains but the way down to the beach is absolutely not for the faint-hearted. You need a very good condition, shouldn‚Äôt be afraid of heights and please don‚Äôt wear Flipflops but proper shoes (I didn‚Äôt). The ‚Äûsafety‚Äú, if you call it like this, is definitely not comparable to European standards.Once you reach the beach it‚Äôs worth the strains! But keep in mind that swimming is not possible due to huge waves and unpredictable and strong currents. So...cool down in the ocean a bit before starting the uphill which should be preferably before the masses of tourists arrive, otherwise you need hours to go back up."
Maarten P,5 contributions,Apr 2019,One of the best views of the island but the hike down is long and pretty rough almost descending vertically at times. The view can however also be enjoyed from above.
Adelene Tschuma,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Magnificent view overlooking the beach and ‚ÄòT-Rex‚Äô/‚Äòfinger‚Äô shaped cliffs. Lots of people trying to take photos and I can only see this place getting more popular as time goes by.Roads aren‚Äôt the best getting to the view point by car or bike & getting down to the beach takes some time as the stairwell is fairly broken/old. Will definently recommend this place to friends and family, I can‚Äôt stop looking back at my photos, the beach is just so beautiful!! "
Maj S,"Baguio, Philippines",Jun 2018,"I highly recommend that you visit this place early in the morning, maybe between 6 am to 7 am to avoid group of tourists flocking on the very tiny stairs way down and be able to have tons of pictures without pressure. The view is very jaw dropping and really amazing, I could just stare at it whole day! The road going here is better compared top the roads going to other places. There are also some small eatery near the area where you can have your breakfast. I regret not going down to the beach so I recommend you must try it. There is no entrance fee which makes it good. Always remember, Be early! :)"
heggieNK,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2019,"View was just like in the pictures.  There was a small deck to take pictures from a higher viewpoint, pay 5000rupiah.  It was near a small eatery.  Go there early and beat the crowd from the daytrip bali tour.  "
Merce a,"Pecatu, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Nice place and a must if you come to Nusa Penida but too manta tourist and the way down to the beach isnt in good conditions. Good views and good places around to drink or eat some local food
Louise M,"Stockholm, Sweden",Apr 2019,Absolutely beautiful. A must do! A lot of people and a big climb down to the beach but worth every step.
Afzal H,18 contributions,Apr 2019,Better to get a view from the vantage points above the T-Rex rock. The hike is not for everyone. gorgeous place
Roversforever,"Bristol, UK",Apr 2019,You just have to see this. It‚Äôs beautiful. Climb down to the beach if you‚Äôre super adventurous. Just remember you will have to climb back up afterwards. You‚Äôll need to be fit.
Pep Pla,"Ambon, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Far away. Bad track. Many spots to take a photo.Not suitable for people with vertigo. White sand and blue water. 
Lindzia A,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2019,Had to go go trough long journey and bumpy road. Be prepared! Not recommended to go by bike unless you are very very fit/ well experienced bikers and have loads of time to spend.
JustAretha,"Los Angeles, CA",Apr 2019,"Listen! I‚Äôve read many stories about people falling to their death by getting too close to the edge. With that in mind, I pretty much stayed away from the edge. It is very tempting to want to get that ‚Äùperfect‚Äù picture so I see why so many risks to do so. However, getting too close to the edge is not necessary. Anywhere on the walkway at Kelingking is a great spot to take a picture without any unforeseen circumstances. The place is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. A trip there is absolutely necessary if you're in Bali. I did not walk down to the each, because, frankly, it looked too scary for me. Plus, a few people who walked back up said it is a little frightening on certain spots going down & coming up. But the view above was all the evidence I needed to see. Grateful I had the opportunity to be a part of this journey and witness what nature spent millions of years to create. Enjoy! Be safe! Take lots of pictures... "
Rithy ‚ò∫Ô∏è,11 contributions,Apr 2019,"Amazing !! If you go by yourself, please check the ferry schedule and location of the ferry pier. To us, we prefer to book a tour starting from our hotel. "
Tom√°≈° Krejƒç√≠,36 contributions,Mar 2019,"If you have a little physical strength, go down to the beach. The way down (and up) is 20-30 minutes, depending on the tourists on the way. I have never seen such beach sand. The place is not for swimming"
Alvilde P,World,Apr 2019,Terrible with all the Trash at the beach. It is killing me. It is also killing the nature and the animals. 
cityofangels13,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2019,"The roads to this place are pretty crazy. The surface is terrible. However it is all worth it when you set eyes on this place. It is picture perfect if you are lucky enough to get it in good weather, The trek down is a little physical but well and truly worth it. The water is so clear and blue. Definitely one of my favorite places that I have been. I haven't seen anything like it. If I could pick one thing to go back to Bali and do or see this would be it hands down. Sure the roads are terrible and the trek down is sketchy but thats Bali. Well and truly worth it."
Natasha Gibson,"Ipswich, Australia",Mar 2019,"We visited Kelingking Beach recently when we did a tour of Nusa Pendia Island. Just breathtaking. If your feeling energetic you can take all the stairs right down to the beach. We didn't have the chance the day we visited, I loved to go back and do it though. We also saw some monkeys hanging around too on the day we visited."
Jahidul I,44 contributions,Mar 2019,I never seen that type of beautiful scenery/ view in my life. Nothing to say........ just Excellent. Don't miss to see  Kelingking Beach
Khir M,3 contributions,Apr 2019,"Been to Kelingking Beach recently. Dear readers, i would like to inform you if going down the hill takes 100% of your energy, going up might takes 300%. Its is not for everybody,but once you reach down the beach, the scenery is breath taking. Please make sure you have plenty of water (going up & down) and be careful with the tides / waves. it can be very strong and they almost drag me away into the sea."
asien_as,"Labuan Bajo, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"It was beautiful place, wish to spend more time and walk down to the beach. But we had limited time that day. Next time i will stay overnight to stay longer and see more of this place... its a considerably small island with several beautiful spot to relax. Riding a motorbike in a rain also quite a challenge here... because some of the road is still not perfectly smooth... so, we need to be careful. The view of this place is just amazing, thats why the tourists is quite crowded here... all want to have picture with the T-Rex shaped stone-like island close to the beach. we manage to have our pic and enjoy a fresh coconut to ease our thirst after about 1 hour ride from the harbour. "
Michael Pulido,5 contributions,Mar 2019,Lovely place to be in Nusa Penida. For more worth experience go face to face with Kelingking beach. =)
Girls On Global Adventures,"Porto Alegre, RS",Apr 2019,The view from the top was really amazing. Gazing upon the beauty of it from the top was pure bliss and with matching sunset it was a perfect way to conclude my Nusa Penida Trip
travelconfidentials,The Netherlands,Apr 2019,of Nusa Penida. First you don't have to stand in line (up stairs). People are waiting in front of the tree to make pictures. The is why the line is there.The climb down is a bit sketchy. Don't wear flip flops/thongs or jandals. I have seen people slip/slide/fall and break there foot wear.  They don't have normal stairs. It is just rocks/sand and or mud and it is very steep. It is even steeper when you want to go to the beach. The beach is beautiful. The waves are very strong. Be careful. At the beach you can buy drinks and snack butunfortunately it comes with the plastic mess that we tourists and the locals provide. Bring your stuff back don't trow it along the way (yes you can see bottles/cans etc) lying around. 
Tom,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs a gorgeous view (after you wait your turn amongst the hundreds of others there just to get a pic with this iconic beach. It takes forever to drive there on some of the worst roads I‚Äôve encountered outside of Africa. In all honesty I think it is better to visit the sites of the island by boat than to set foot on land. The infrastructure is very poor. Pretty coastline but that‚Äôs about it. "
Greg F,"San Diego, CA",Feb 2019,This was a wow!  Gotta see this in person.  Road to the cliffs was really rough so be prepared for a jarring ride.  Then when you get there it's about 500 stairs straight down to the beach.  Not for the faint of heart or anybodybody afraid of heights.  
karlmonty,100 contributions,Mar 2019,What a view def worth checking out Nusa Penida if you staying in Bali some breath taken views üëå !!!!
frida s,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"It's really worth to come to this place, through those bumpy roads and hot sunny day... but in the end, you will be surprised and amazed by the awesome view."
BeenThereDoneThatGB,"Edgware, UK",Mar 2019,"Amazing beautiful gorgeous out of this world beach.u can‚Äôt swim in it. Unless ur a very good swimmer waves and currents are way to strongIf ur not fit don‚Äôt even attempt to go there, it‚Äôs very hard to get down there but totally worth the walk.Make sure you wear proper shoes (you will thank me for that later)And I cannot stress this enough water water water."
mariosalltimefavs,"Berlin, Germany",Sep 2018,"Kelingking is defininately a must-see and the also the beach down the steep path...BUT it's just gotten simply too popular in the last years. A good indicator is that even Chinese people are hiiting the spot now, although the bamboo steps down are quite challenging."
Anjan G,"Hyderabad, India",Mar 2019,"As you all know this is the famous, most Instagram-ed icon of Bali and Indonesia... the beach that looks like a dinosaur head. Though we didn't get the chance to trek down to the beach itself the view from above was just mind-blowing. One of the most beautiful places in Bali, this beach is still to be developed as most roads are bad and the trail down is dangerous, but still its beauty is unmatched. A must visit stop in Bali!"
cesaralonsogs,"Austin, TX",Mar 2019,"We stopped at Kelingking Beach as the second place in our tour of Nusa Penida. We were not able to walk down to the beach due to our busy schedule, but the views from the top are stunning. A must-see if you are in Nusa Penida. "
Crystal C,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2018,"If i had enough time i would have chosen to stay in Nusa Penida for a night to truly appreciate the beauty of what this island can offer.  Kelingking Beach is stunning but crowded at noon/ in the afternoon.  We have to line up in certain spots to take a good photo.  Due to time constraint of the day tour, we were also not able to hike further down to the beach which was a big regret."
Verly T,14 contributions,Mar 2019,This place is very beautiful and is comparable to blue mountain in Australia. The slope is very steep but it has magnificent view. Did not manage to go down the slope as it is not suitable for young children. 
Iris L,"Pennington, NJ",Jun 2018,"Kelingking Beach is definitely one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever visited. With coral reefs, crystal clear water, and white sand, this is an amazing trip that you should be sure to visit. "
Sienna,"Little India, Singapore",Mar 2019,"I didn‚Äôt climb down because my friends and I didn‚Äôt have the time unfortunately. But the view was beautiful! There are a lot of tourists so keep that in mind but it‚Äôs stunning and if you walk around a bit you can get some great pics. If you‚Äôre hiking down, definitely wear sneakers! "
melissaj962,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"First of all, don‚Äôt do the day trip. You must stay on this beautiful untouched island for a few days to really appreciate Nusa Penida. We came to Kelingking twice - once around 8am to take photos from the top and fly the drone. A good time to get here before the cars full of tourists turn up (usually between 830-9) From this we then planned to walk all the way down to the beach a few mornings later and we started our walk at 7am. I‚Äôd advise getting there as early as this or even earlier to firstly hike in the cooler weather before it gets too hot and secondly so you can have the whole beach to yourself! Truly amazing.The hike itself is tough. We are both athleticly for and found it a challenge. It‚Äôs mostly rock climbing and if the weather has been raining the night before it‚Äôs very slippery. Make sure you wear trainers and sensible clothes. The halfway point hike isn‚Äôt too bad but to carry on after this and go to the beach is where it gets hard. There are ropes to help guide you down but once you‚Äôre down it‚Äôs so beautiful. Litter-free, supersoft sand and clear water. Not safe enough to swim in but still stunning. On the way back up make sure you have enough water and strength as for the most part you have to pull yourself up physically - there are no steps. Good luck!"
prem singh,"Faridabad, India",Mar 2019,amazing amazing & amazing .....wish i could go down the beach !!!. its a bit risky to go full down till bottom from Top.....if you got an opportunity book a ferry tour to its bottom .
mansiD88,"Pune, India",Mar 2019,One has to trek down to the beach below to see the true beauty of the place. The trek should be made preferably in shoes or sandals with back strap and would be better if the start is made early like 8.30 am so that it isn't too hot. The trek route has been fitted with rails to hold onto so it makes the walk easy as well and not so scary! Ofcourse you still sweat it out in the entire journey but the coconut water at the end of it is so refreshing :)
Joey Catania,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,"Beautiful Beach on the island of Nusa Penida. Unfortunately with my other review of Nusa Penida - this would be the only place worth visiting.Lovely and clean.However be warned it is not for the unfit or elderly. Please do not attempt the climb down to the beach is about a kilometer long and both the accent and decent are extremely treacherous,  with vertical climbs in some parts. If you injure yourself you will not be able to climb out and there are no emergency services to help you.  "
Emvestment,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2019,"You need 5-10 mins walk from car park to have a good view. This place still completely perfect. You can take picture from the Top to get the best view. However there are a lot of tourists.RECOMMEND : 1.To bring umbrella with you and ware the comfortable suit because it is very hot.2. To have local guide, it is easy for you to reach many places such as Kelingling beach, Broken Beach, Crystal Bay and Angel Billabong because mobile signal is not quite good for using GPS"
Marisa W,"Newman, Australia",Mar 2019,Views where amazing but no way i was walking down those steps to stand on that beautiful beach. Road bad in patches getting to the viewpoint 
WarrenMoonjr,"Minneapolis, MN",Feb 2019,"The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. Kelingking beach is located on Nusa Penida, with is a separate island located about 30 minutes by boat from Sanur, Bali. Nusa Penida is still undeveloped, and I would recommend spending a few nights here to really enjoy the island. Another option would be staying on Nusa Lembongan which is only a 5 minute boat ride away from Penida, it has more accommodation options available (in total their are 3 Nusa Islands all located next to each other). Note: It's takes about 30 minutes to get down to the actual beach at Kelingking, but around 1-1.5 hrs to climb back up. The stairs are steep and rocky, not the easiest climb. Their are hand rails most of the way, would not recommend the climb for anyone with mobility or endurance issues. Many people simply come and take pictures from the top without ever climbing down to the water. And that works fine for all fitness/mobility levels. It's a very popular spot, get there early if you can to avoid the crowds. Nusa Penida is amazing, this isn't a spot to rush through in one day. They have tons of great beaches (like crystal bay), great snorkeling, and landmarks like angels billabong, broken beach, etc. The roads to get around the island are in pretty bad shape. Tons of potholes and rubble. It takes a long time to travel around the island because of the bad conditions. If you are renting a scooter be very careful on the roads. You can also rent a driver to get around, it's expensive, but worth it for convenience."
Brenda W,7 contributions,Nov 2018,"Steep! bring water and wear shoes!! Amazing views and soft sand. Watch the tide pull, though. Potentially very dangerous."
Globspotters,"Gdansk, Poland",Mar 2019,A lot of tourists! very nice place although the queue to the picture spoils a little all. around a lot of interesting places where you can eat well
Darma S,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"I visited Kelingking Beach with our Guest few weeks ago, it is really amazing place, for selfie , pre weeding photo, and to enjoy the best view of beautiful scenery. Best time to visit is day time so We can see the blue clear  water . When you visit Bali , please do not miss this place. "
nicholasbhc,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2019,"The visit was crowded with the arrived fast tourist, so to get a selfie was at your peril..but the coast is outstanding..the roads were rough...You need to be fit and with appropriate climbing footware, its quite dangerous if your not use to climbing but there is a firm rail..I wonder whether the locals are happy with the  amount of traffic and convoys of white transporter taking up the road..with the cost is unrealistic,for a single traveller i paid 1,500 000 or 1,100000 for a couple this included broken rock, angel b and crystal and all trsnsfer..only 50,000 really!! Not a water include..i feel the boat companies are taking a huge cut and there appears to be not money going into the island resources like inproving the roads..i see locals looking annoyed.I would just get a fast boat there and just spend all day at crystal beach..until the last fast boat back..4:30 and 5:30 depends on boat company.I wouldnt be racing back there in any hurry.."
LSJ,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2019,"If you are a lover of a cliff with beach & sea, this is a breadth taking view that you cannot find anywhere else.A good place to visit but this place is getting crowded with tourist each day. Tour and guides are also getting more expensive."
FlanMurray,"Charlottetown, Canada",Feb 2019,"Views here are very beautiful and breathtaking! Lots of shops to buy drinks and food at the top. It‚Äôs a very steep climb down, only made it halfway down. Watch out for Instagram models trying to get the ‚Äúperfect shot‚Äù. Queues of people lining up to get the ‚Äúshot‚Äù get in the way of the actual pathway and can be dangerous"
bromo ijen tour service,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"good vibes when you love a cliff with beach & sea ,and another island will reach in 45 minute from sanur bali by fastboat ,nusa penida has a lot of beach and not too many people around there , if you more than 3 person better you use a car hire you can found it around the port of penida island - bromo ijen tour driver - +6281 - 39000 - 7303"
Lori K,Boulder CO,Feb 2019,"Stunning location.  It is a challenge to get there.  I would recommend a driver and just be prepared for a bumpy ride.  This view is not to be missed!  The route down to the beach is much harder than it looks, mostly because it was SO HOT and HUMID.  I did not make it all the way down to the beach, but was very content to take in the view from the top. "
Barry Sloan,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2019,An amazing place to visit. Be aware though that the road there is very very rough. Recommend you go there with a local driver
Suha,Kaadedhdhoo,Nov 2018,A must see beach. The road to reach this beautiful destination was tough but totally worth it. I would definitely go there again.
Mike G,26 contributions,Jan 2019,"Lots of reports of this place getting too popular w day trippers. Is true, so best to stay on Penida for a few days, get a motorbike and explore. I got to Kelingking at 8:30 am and had it ALL TO MYSELF! Climbed down to the beach (very challenging coming back up but well worth it!) and had that to myself too. A few brave souls made it down a while later. Easily THE most beautiful site I‚Äôve ever seen and THE most beautiful beach. "
karthikeyan_nadar,"Chennai (Madras), India",Feb 2019,"In nusa penida it‚Äôs one of the best . It was very beautiful to have a good view of the beach from the top . I wanted to walk down to the beach , but I had no time . Try to go early in the morning to the beach as it‚Äôs very hot and humid . Take lot of photos . For kids it‚Äôs not safe . No proper fence. It‚Äôs must visit place . "
Stephie Cyr,"London, Canada",Feb 2019,Don't miss this hot spot. There are multiple places to take jaw dropping pictures. The hike down is quite steep so I skipped it but really a gorgeous must see site 
Flyer55_12,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,"Nusa Penida is a great place but those couple of places were all those Chinese tourists go to can get a bit crowded, where as the other spots you can sometimes have all to yourself. Try to go very early or very late in the day to miss the crowds."
danny1127,"Bristol, UK",Feb 2019,"Yes it is a gruelling walk down and back up. And you will definitely work up a sweat. But it is definitely worth it! Quiet beach at the foot of the cliff. Not overly touristy with some of the softest sand, clearest water and best waves going. Great fun in paradise. Word of advise, the climb is difficult and at times quite dangerous. Be careful and may Be consider taking a pair of good trainers for the walk down and up. Also take some water or snacks down with you. There is a little family vendor down on the beach but they will understandably charge you a fortune so go prepared. "
Zac,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2019,"The view of the beach, water and cliff is amazing. Definitely worth a trip. The scooter ride was fine but if you aren‚Äôt experienced or don‚Äôt want to get a sore bum, hire a car to take you over - it‚Äôs a 30-40min ride. We went on a really hot day and struggled to get out of the sun If you hike up to the right there‚Äôs a few nice spots for photos If you go snorkeling at manta ray bay get your guide to point this beach out "
Megan S,16 contributions,Feb 2019,Stunning!!! If you are looking for a perfect instagram photo then this is it!To get there you can go with a car or hire scooters. We hired scooters because we love going out on our own. If you hire a scooter try get one that has good shocks because the road is very very bad in some parts. Once you are there and you would like to tan on a quiet beach then there is a path that takes you down to a quiet beach but its a difficult path to get down but so worth it.
Karen B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2019,"The view from the cliff here is spectacular and you will get some amazing photos.  But...... it is very crowded and there are many people lining up to get the standard insta photo.  And they don't care how long they hold the queue up.  Apart from that, nice spot.  Pity it takes forever to get there on the terrible roads.  Is quite steep too so not suitable for anyone will mobility issues."
GodBlessMali,"Shanghai Region, China",Feb 2019,"Even though I went to Bali for scuba diving, I had to spend one day visiting the west part of Nusa Penida which I believe is more famous and appealing than the east part.My first stop was the Kelingking beach which I absolutely loved. Many people complained about the crowd, but if you visit it before 11AM like I did, you won't see a lot of people until you go back to the top.The view from the top is breathtaking, and you can fully admire the T-Rex shape that everyone talks about. However, there is more to it. If you take your courage in both hands, and make it all the way down to the beach, you will not regret it. Though be warned than it's rather tricky to reach to the beach, and I strongly recommend you to wear a good pair of shoes over sandals, but you will want to wear the latter once you reach the beach. A woman twisted her ankle on the way down, and I have absolutely no idea how she made it back to the top so please be careful if you wish to go to the beach.Once you are at the beach, simply enjoy. The waves crushing on the beach make it a very relaxing place, and the view is also quite amazing. That said, if you wish to swim, you might be disappointed as the currents are quite strong, and only experienced swimmers should enjoy.Again, if you want to fully enjoy this place, go early in the day. There were six or seven people on the beach when I went in the morning, but close to a hundred when I went back up early in the afternoon.Enjoy :)"
Lizzie M,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"If you are visiting Nusa Penida here is a must. Such stunning views and beautiful beach. However please note it gets very busy here as it is a very ""instagramable"" location. It is best to get here early to beat the crowds. Also make sure you have water with you as it gets very hot here and there is alot of stairs. "
rodden23,"Qingdao, China",Feb 2019,One of the most beautiful beaches one earth and one of the most Instagram-worthy photo ops in Asia! A must visit when in Bali!
honzamartinec,133 contributions,Feb 2019,"This place is most famous in this island and you should visit as well. There is lots of tourists up there to take a shot, but get down to the beach and it will be much better. It's not hike for everybody and sometimes it's bit scary, but wooden railing is ready to help. It's worth it "
An T,"Kharkiv, Ukraine",Feb 2019,"Will never forget the beauty of this place! You just want to stay there and stare at the place.It‚Äôs possible to go down to the beach,but the stairs are very steep,we went down half way and couldn‚Äôt make it to the end:very hot! We went up and I thought my heart would stop beating. I don‚Äôt recommend to go down the steps unless you plan to swim and rest down there,though people say it‚Äôs even harder to go back after swimming.From the top it‚Äôs as beautiful as from the bottom "
Matt Bakes,"East Riding of Yorkshire, UK",Feb 2019,Well worth a visit! The views from the top are incredible. Didn‚Äôt take the steps down to the beach as it takes around 2 hours to go down and back up
Hus,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2019,"Kelingking beach is a must visit when you go to Nusa Penida.The actual beach is located at the end of the cliff and is a steep climb down.It is easy while going down but get exhausting while climbing back up beware.The entire experience will talk at least half a day so only recommended for those who stay in NP.Day trippers can enjoy view from top.The trek down is scary but the thrill and adrenaline and what you want for adventure.Be sure to have a coconut after the trek costs 20,000 and a huge one"
zagidullinakristina,"Kazan, Russia",Feb 2019,So dangerous and long stair. Impossible for old people and children. Be careful. But really cool beach and view.
Flory S,15 contributions,Jan 2019,"View from the top was stunning, but getting to Kelingking is really difficult! The roads are pretty bad, and whether you go by scotter or car prepare for a tiring journey.Yes, it was amazing to look at the view but I dont think I will do it again for the pain you have to endure with the horrible roads. We didnt go down to the beach as you can tell by the path, that its not an easy one to climb down and up - it's really steep and adventurous! We also heard stories of people who went down and were stuck as they couldnt come up. Only thing annoying was the number of instagram crazy people who would do anything for a perfect picture! We even thought some of them were going to fall down the cliff as they were staying really close to the edge. We went in the supposedly low season, and I thought this was crowded. If you are going during the peak season, then be prepared for a ton of tourists when you get to this place."
Kevin,"Ubud, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"Getting to Kelingking is kind of a challenge due to the bad roads. But totally worth it!When you arrive theres an amazing view from the top of the cliff.Theres also the option to go down the cliff to the beach. I would only advise to do that with enough to drink and a little food. It's quite an adventure and can be very challenging if you're not too fit. On the beach there is a man selling drinks, but prepare to pay the max price there, we paid 110k for a large bottle of water and 2 cokes (and were happy to)."
Ron,"Taguig City, Philippines",Dec 2018,"Visited here year end with my family and friends.Second day of our trip  is Nusa Penida Day. We wouod love to see both east and west but due to time restriction we only have the chance to visit the west. Kelingking Beach is the most popular among all west area tourist spots. I can simply say that this place is simply amazing. Picture perfect. Instagramable.Super worth the bumpy ride (about an hour or so travelling in a rough road, small road near the clift) needs to be a good driver to reach the place.Its Haven for me....i enjoyed the view.Really Perfect!! The deep TRex shaped rock formation  covered w green grass and trees, super white sand , and deep blue see, ohh God! Its really amazing,! I cant get over !!! Would love to go down to be near and even see the beach but since we have minor with us we opted not and just enjoy the moment and take photos , relax and wander! Good thing we didnt go down as after some.minutes rain poured. So it will.be more stiff and slippery.  Super worth the trip, the money,! One of a kind experience! One of the most and must see in Bali,! Never miss the chance! "
Frank C,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,I was impressed with this beach type of cliff beaches look clean and without sort of pollution a must for must for tourists to see 
Xanerin,"Alice Springs, Australia",Jan 2019,"This is a fabulous beach and you can get some great photo shots, but boy is it a hard trek to get to it, and of course even harder coming up.  If you are not fit and agile, I would suggest not attempting it.  Some monkeys live in this area which were really cute and it is really a beautiful place to see nature at its best.  Plenty of toilets available in the area 5000 rupiah. "
Dima,"Moscow, Russia",Jan 2019,"But so very hard. Me and my wife down 35 minutes. However this beach... I recommend. Take away comfortable shoes, because very slick "
Devang,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2019,"To reach Nusa paneida from Bali, was great experience by travellingin a cruise name: MOLA MOLA tour cruise. It took approx; 40 mins to reach Nusa paneida harbour.From Harbour to kelingking beach, it took approx. 1 hour to reach. The roads are too narow to reach. But, when we reached there, our all tiredness gone.The view was significantly scenic & i have never seen such clear crystal water. God has gifted them very beautiful beach. Really, can't miss this spot in Bali."
Biswadeep M,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Jan 2019,"If you are in Bali and not visiting Just Penida,  you will regret later.  This was the first place we went during our trip.  It took 40mins to reach the point.  Roads were little bumpy not recommended for pregnant women. What do I say about the view, it was breath taking. There are multiple photo spots which you should must take selfies. If you are adventurers and would like to take some risk,  can actually go down till the end to explore the beauty.  Please note: Roads towards the beach üåä‚òÄ is quite dangerous, take decision wisely.  "
Wayan Trips Bali,"Kuta, Indonesia",Jan 2019,Kelingking beach one of best beach at Nusa Penida islandWill you visit this place.? Get resonable price and experienced driver
KomangAkah,"Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Kelingking Beach also known as Dino Beach. The road to this place is not really good but it is paid after you arrived here. It is really instagram-able place with a superb view. If you have enough power and love challenge, you can come down and enjoy the nice beach. But if you are not, relax and taking picture from the top of the cliff is also nice."
Olia F,"London, UK",Jan 2019,One of the best beaches...ever. The climb is insane and dangerous but if you are fit I highly recommend it. Allow for at least half a day for it to truly enjoy. The climb is a half hour if not longer. Blew my mind.
rohancarrall,7 contributions,Jan 2019,"The views from the top of this cliff are absolutely amazing, with the water a mix of crystal clear with deep blues and greens. The currents were a little strong when we took the mighty trek down to the beach itself, but both the trek and the currents are well worth the views. "
Sue V,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2019,"Kelingking Beach was everything I thought it would be, the photos just don't do it justice.Be warned though the roads are atrocious in and out of the area and there is a constant stream of cars and scooters. The walk down to the beach isn't for feint hearted and you need to allow about 2 hours for the return trip including a swim. The surf was very strong the day we visited and it would be quite dangerous for poor swimmers."
Nicole D,"Ubud, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"Truly a remarkable experience!  If you travel to Bali visiting nusa penida Island is a MUST! We had our own travel guide who took us to the local beaches (broken beach, billabong, kelingking beach and crystal beach). Just know this is an entire day trip! We left our hotel in ubud at 7am and arrived back at 5pm. Wear comfortable shoes so you can hike up and down kelingking beach. Please please wear sunscreen as the sun gets extremely strong around 11pm. I have a slight sun burn because I didn‚Äôt put sunscreen on early enough. Other than that, enjoy the magnificent island! Take a load off and enjoy your surroundings ‚ù§Ô∏è. And please please do pick up after yourselves. We must preserve this place as long as we can."
Aron B,Norway,Aug 2018,"If you have the time, take a day trip to Nusa Penida. I would recommend using the tour operator ""Bali mission tour"".Kelingking is really stunning. If you have the time, take a walk down to the beach."
jabir1423,"Sibiu, Romania",Jan 2019,"Amazing wonder of nature. If you can and have the stamina for it ,you should definitely go down to the beach. Breath taking!"
Bali Nusa Penida Tours,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"It's really best place of worlds,we are neverever see the place like Klingking beach really nice view and romantic place Also nice pre-wedding "
Kenny100653,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,"brilliant views - good facilities with plenty of food outlets and places to sit. did not venture to the beach as it looked quite a hike, but well worth the effot I would suggest."
Travel dreams,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2019,"amazing. If you want to go down to the beach. You need 2-3 hours. And a really good shape. Its a long way, not a easy.  "
Cristina S,10 contributions,Jan 2019,"Kelingking beach is very pretty. The water is very blue and the waves are strong. The beach is large and it offers you a little stand with drinks and snacks (incredibly expensive!!)However, the climb to get up and down is difficult and dangerous. It takes about 30-45 min to get down and it can get very steep and hard on the knees. Going up can require a lot of water because it‚Äôs incredibly hot.Once you‚Äôre up, there are some restaurants offering all kind of things to eat. Honestly, I would suggest you to stay up and take pictures ans then go for a swim at another beach. Ps, the entrance is 5000rp/person"
David K,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2019,"Amazing beach, fun hike down and back up, quite strenuous, not suitable for the elderly or young children, make sure you go at low tide only"
Suzana Fernandes,2 contributions,Jan 2019,Perfect. Just the mkost beautiful beach ever seen! The hiking is hard but worth it. Almost desert beach. 
MsLigs,"Kriens, Switzerland",Jan 2019,"Truly a nature‚Äôs wonder. I was in awe of the beauty of this place, although going there is tough. The road is very rough and takes around an hours ride from the harbor but it was all worth it. The view is awesome and they have white sandy beach aside from the view of the dinosaur shaped head rock formation. I would surely come again to explore more that place and perhaps stay longer in this Island. It was the highlight of our New year Indonesia trip."
illion,11 contributions,Dec 2018,Getting a picture was a crazy scramble. Our guide told us going down to the beach would take 2 hours which we didn‚Äôt have time for. The view was fantastic but hardly enough time for a 1 day tour. Stay longer if you can
Lita,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"kerrrrrrrreeeeeeeennn it's like a big pool with the head of dinosaurs. nice view. kelingking beach is the prettiest ever beach i ever saw, you must go there and take a selfie but still be careful with the cliffs."
Faye Pelagio,"Quezon City, Philippines",Dec 2018,This beach is such a beauty! Too bad that we ran out of time to go down to the beach (30minutes walk if you really want to go down). The road going here is too narrow and bumpy. Our driver is the best in taking picture and he made sure that our safety is his first priority. 
cavamebri,"Albany, Australia",Jan 2019,"Incredible view from the top and amazing scenery. Unfortunately it was very, very busy when we were there. There is also a lot of rubbish littered around, which is so disappointing. Why do people have to drop their empty water bottles and empty packets everywhere? So easy to take it back with you and put in a bin!"
Gani Wibisono,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Amazing place....the view is spectacular !! if you want you can down to the beach, about 45 min to go down, and around 1 hour or more to go up back...the sand is so white so so beautiful "
Belinda M,80 contributions,Jan 2019,"Hot tip: Go in the early morning to avoid the bulk of people! We had finished the climb at around 12/12:30 and there were so many people up top taking photos and along the climbing route.This makes the climb longer as you have to wait for the people in front of you. The climb itself is quite difficult. It took us approximately 30mins to get back to the top and we are relatively fit people. At some parts you will be basically rock climbing vertically (your legs and muscles will be sore the next day). The lack of stairs makes it challenging but is also what makes it adventurous and fun. The beach is really nice. It does have large waves and currents, so listen to the lifeguard and be prepared to be dumped by the waves at some point. I would definitely recommend this climb and beach! "
Jade L,"Denarau Island, Fiji",Jan 2019,"There was a lot of people on top of the Kelingking Beach. There‚Äôs so good views. The stairs (can‚Äôt really call them stairsüòÇ) was very hard and tough. I felt like I‚Äôm gonna pass out, my friend needed to carry some woman up because she was passed out in the midway. It took almost 2 hours to get down because it was raining and the steps were very slippery and I did it barefoot. The way up took about 1 hour. After hardwork there is beautiful beach but be careful because waves are big and currency is strong. I don‚Äôt recommend going down if you don‚Äôt have enough power and you should bring a lot of water and wear proper sneakers. Not gonna go down ever again.. "
Sharon P,3 contributions,Dec 2018,"Tough climb down, and a little dangerous. I felt like it was worth it.  But be careful playing in the water, the pull of the waves can be very dangerous.  Best beach I've been on.  ever.  "
bigblub,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,Not recommended for young children the track was very hard and slippery need moderate skill to take to the beach
Mark and Mikaela,"Vientiane, Laos",Dec 2018,"If you are confident with scooters you can go check it out yourself, if not book a tour! Roads can get pretty bad and narrow with other cars on the road. Once you are there check out all the lookouts around the cliff and go down to at least the neck of the dinosaur! Watch out for super steep and slippery steps! "

Ashwin D,"Johannesburg South, South Africa",Dec 2018,The views are amazing from here . Good for taking pictures at this place. A bit of a walk to the point where you can take pictures. The ocean looks amazing from here
AlexCarcea,"London, UK",Dec 2018,"If you travelling to Bali and you‚Äôre not going to see this beach you will regret all your life . The landscape from top it is like heaven, amazing, for me one of the best beach in the world and I have seen a few around the world.Our planet is beautiful. Love Earth üòç"
Caroline C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"The landscape from above is magnificent. If you have time, you should go down to the beach but the road is very steep. Please use comfortable shoes or sandal. I can't believe such place exist. Very beautiful."
Marleen J,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Oct 2018,Come early! The crowd arrive at about 10:30ish and this makes it difficult to ascend the very steep steps to the beach. The climb is really strenuous. There is a small warung at the bottom.
Ali Asgar B,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2018,This is the most beautiful beach to visit Bali with crystal clear waters. you can see lots of fishes specially Manta Ray in this beach
Mike B,"Southend-on-Sea, UK",Dec 2018,"I wasn‚Äôt really sure what I was expecting when I turned up at this place. The staircase down to the beach is... something else. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend without a good level of fitness, bravery and a strong pair of shoes. The beach at the bottom is WELL worth it! The waves were about 10 foot plus so we had fun playing in the waves for a few hours. There was a guy at the bottom selling snacks and water so don‚Äôt worry too much if you can‚Äôt take it.  It recommended for kids."
Sangeetha S,"Bangalore District, India",Dec 2018,This place has retained its pristine charm mostly due to the difficulty involved in actually navigating all the way down. The place is literally breathtaking. The blue of the ocean is mesmerising. This is a must see beach and something you would absolutely love at first sight. It‚Äôs a pleasure even to see this from atop the hill if one isn‚Äôt interested or has a shortage of time to go all the way down. 
SARIAH A,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,It looks like monster from top. Its nice and beautiful. Its worth to visit. Its 45mins journey from Bali by Ferry. Less tourists. A place that not fully develop. 
Peter V,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2018,"One of our favourites on Nusa Penida. The view is unreal, however the steps to get down are quite dangerous. If you are not comfortable with hiking, definitely avoid. One mistake and you are done. Runners highly recommended!"
Antonis Mykonos,"Mykonos, Greece",Nov 2018,"Incredible view!!! Really dangerous paths, ridiculous the fact that these disgusting dirty toilets had a sign outside with the price for use. "
SingaporeYoungCouple,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"'Kelingking' in Indonesia language is 'the little (last) finger'. But in my view i see it more like a shape of T-rex dinasour üòÅ. And the island next to it (left side) look like a crocodile head. Be extra careful of steps and the bamboo barrier. The bamboo barriers are not strong. Steps to the beach below are very steep! If u're not fit, dont allow yourself to do it and just enjoy the view frm above. "
Frogimo,"London, UK",Nov 2018,"The way to the beach is quite dangerous as there is not real path way, just an oddly built way down a cliff... Not advised if you aren't in a good physical shape.... But totally worth the effort if you want to see an incredible untouched, naturally beautiful, beach. (The efforts makes you appreciate the beach even more!) Don't forget to take sports shoes for the climb!"
David,New Zealand,Oct 2018,The view and the beach are stunning and the walk down the stairs is an adventure. We went there on a weekend and there too many people to really enjoy the place though. Tricky to get that empty beach Instagram shot ;-) 
Shyama R,New Delhi,Dec 2018,"Well this is the most beautiful beach I have seen in my lifeAfter seeing the beach from the cliff we decided we had to go down.  The whole climb was not easy. There are no stairs. Just the rocks with some space. Wooden blocks or bamboos are placed on both sides for support. At certain point there is only place for 1 person to stand at a time. It will take 20-30min to go down. But it's worth it. Clean and blue beach. The waves are strong yet awesome. Caves on both sides. It just like in movies. Beware on climb up as it will drain you. Took us around 1 hour. And the sun was just bright and hurting us. Well no matter how dangerous it was, everything was worth it. If you just want to  stay at the cliff and click only photos. It's ok, but trust me the real beauty is not the cliff."
AnnalisaRobLeo,Sri Lanka,Dec 2018,"Its a bumpy journey to get to by car but worth a visit. I would suggest that you hire a driver for the day, we paid about ¬£25... The views over Kelingking beach are spectacular.  The journey down is tough so only attempt if you are fit to climb down a pretty ropey track. Kelingking beach is very close to Broken beach and Angels Billabong so you can see 3 attractions all in the same area."
Kalie L,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2018,"Next time, I would go by boat. It is about an hour walk down, hate to think how long it would take me to get back up! Lol.Not for people with mobility issues. You need to be fit!"
May L,"San Francisco, CA",Nov 2018,"We had a full day originally coming from Peguyangan, Tembeling Beach, and then Kelingking. The journey was quite long, but getting there was sooooooo worth it. I didn‚Äôt trek down to the beach at Kelingking, so we enjoyed the sunset from above. It seriously is so worth the long journey. I totally recommend this. "
Mahesh Jaiswal,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2018,"Must visit place, it‚Äôs apart of Nusa penida tour, you can pre Book it there are many agencies or you can ask your hotel. "
Diksha S,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2018,"We had view from top of the mountain, to reach down to the beach it is trek of 1 1/2 hrs to 2 hrs, so we didn‚Äôt go down to the beach but still from upstairs the whole was mesmerisingMust visit if you‚Äôre planning for Nusa Penida "
Anabel M,43 contributions,Nov 2018,"Price is 5k per person and 1k for the scooter. You can rent a bike and go on your own. The roads are in bad conditions but it's not impossible, if you are on a tight budget and have some experience driving I would say this is the way to go. Be patience and go slowly. The views are amazing but we decided not to go down because it was raining pretty bad all day since 7am and I didn't have good footwear.. after reading some comments here I am glad we didn't do it. We had some food there, 30k for a nice chicken rice. If you are here on rainy season always have a good poncho with you and wear sandals."
NinaTraveler,"Zurich, Switzerland",Nov 2018,The beach is super beautiful but the access to go down the cliff could be really dangerous if you didn't have any hiking or climbing experience.
rgill_28,"Vancouver, Canada",Nov 2018,"Stunning view from up top of the dinosaur rock. Can get really pretty views at sunset. That hike down. Oh wow, that was very very hard. It‚Äôs extremely slippery going down. I have size 14 feet which made it very difficult for me to find footing to place my feet. I hike quite often back home in Western Canada, so I felt pretty confident doing it until I slipped and fell and cut up my elbows. Then entire way down, shaking legs and thoughts of ‚Äúoh god I‚Äôm going to die here.‚Äù I advice anyone doing this hike: if you struggled in the first half of the hike which is until the dinosaur‚Äôs back and then u turn towards the beach and start going down to do other half. TURN back! So can get some very pretty pictures from there because the second half down is soooo much worse and extremely steep with very tight spacing which makes it very tricky when ur going down and ppl are coming up. Some ppl were doing the hike bare feet to get better grip which might be an idea worth trying?!?Once you get down to the beach, it is pure paradise. Can‚Äôt swim in it but the massive waves are beautiful to see and there is a tiny stand down there serving drinks which is cool. Can‚Äôt believe they go up/down that hike every day with merchandise. Hike back up was fine for me because I have strong upper body and it requires lots of pulling yourself up holding onto support branches that are places along hike. My wife who has weak upper body found it very challenging going back up and was sore for about 3 days where she couldn‚Äôt move her arms without pain. Hike down she flew down because she had to pee real bad."
Mika S,Salo,Nov 2018,Fantastic view. I got a lot of very nice pictures from there. Stairs were scary. Be carefully if you are going down to beach. 
Rony,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2018,"Worth the 30 mins of a hike down to the beach. Be careful when holding onto those ""fences"" as it's not stable and it's steep as f*#$ as well.  "
Marcio M,"Niteroi, RJ",Oct 2018,One of the most beautiful places around Bali. From the top you have a great view and a long track down to the beach. But it worthwhile.
foodcrawlph,"1,536 contributions",Nov 2018,Picturesque view from the top but the trail leading to the beach requires a long hike. Travellers who intend to walk down the beach area should be prepared with enough water and proper footwear. We skipped the steep walk and stayed in the cliff bThere are food stalls near the parking area for meals and refreshments for a fairly affordable price. 
Jon_Ju1234,"Reykjavik, Iceland",Jun 2018,"We went to Kelingking beach on a day where it was raining on off. It was not raining, but the ground was wet. We decided that climbing down to the beach down below was a good idea. However, the path is VERY steep and slippery.During our decent to the beach my girlfriend slipped, and her phone jumped up from her purse. I watch it skip down the steep path and past the ""safety"" bars. From there the phone slid about 1 meter and stopped on an edge.5 cm more and it would have dropped to the ocean c.a. 100m bellow. Somehow I managed to get on my stomach and squees through the safety gate(a week fence made from bamboo). I reached the phone, realising shortly after that it was probably not worth the risk I took.Basically, if you decide to go to the beach at the bottom, make sure you are wearing good shoes and be sure to be extremely careful if you decide to go when the path is wet.However, this place is amazing, you don't need to go to the beach bellow to enjoy it."
Septia C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"One of the most beautiful places I have ever visited! I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw it! Unbelievable! i went down the cliff to the beach and it was more than worth it. only a few people there, and at the top, there were actually many people."
Annie Pham,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2018,"Come here early, or after 3pm as this place gets extremely crowded! This place is so beautiful and definitely worth a visit! "
Diaz P,96 contributions,Nov 2018,"I like natural view and not common. So I choose Nusa Penida. Comparing my visit last year, more tourists visit this beach. Unfortunately Local government does not yet build road facility to this beach. Other facilities that must be equipped are trash bin, cellular access and winker. I also suggest to local audthority to add two trips to Bali from Nusa Penida so we have more time to enjoy Nusa Penida and able to come back to Bali at 17 PMI called my holiday to some spots in Nusa Penida as extreme journey, because we need more effort and power to arrive there using motor cycle (some roads are still broken and only a few winker) and off course walk down to the spot or walk down to the steps. Need to dare to walk down and pass ravine. I dont have daring to pass ravine. So I enjoy the rock cliff and sea view. How about youI agree with other writers that the traveller must prepare the best route to maximize your visit in 1 or 2 days, powerbank, guide (if needed), equipment (sun glasses etc)"
emtod,"Gainesville, FL",Oct 2018,"Obviously I saw a photo of Kelingking Beach on Instagram about 2 years ago, and ever since then I knew I had to go see it. Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able. I could have done it in flip flops, but I didn't want to ditch my husband lol.Beyond the actual views, there are a bunch of warungs where you can get food and drink, fresh coconut, etc. We did have to pay a small fee (15,000? 11,000 IDR?) to park our motorbike there as well, which was fine. The road to the actual beach is not paved and needs some serious work -- the east side of the island, in comparison, is *much* nicer in that regard. But I'm sure in a year or two, it'll all be paved."
Pratyush Srivastava,"Navi Mumbai, India",Oct 2018,"This place is surreal and truly heaven. The T Rex shaped cliff and clear blue water with hundred shades of blue.. Perfect for picture and enjoy the nature and sea around.. To reach the beach one needs to climb down the cliff, a lil hard, but doable. Takes more than an hour or two.. If you have time, don't miss going down beach.. You won't regret this.. But don't swim too far..Its a perfect place to be.. and most beautiful in Nusa Penida.. Bali too..."
HariKRajeev,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2018,This is one of the places to visit before you die . The beach has a viewing area from the top . We can take pictures from there . If it is a crowded day then you will have to stand in a long queue . There is a narrow walk way to the beach . It is very steep . A lot of tourists take that . But it is broken in the beginning. 
Janwood47,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Nov 2018,"We had a driver all day who took us here.  The view was spectacular however the road needs improving, given the large of amount of daily traffic to this special tourist attraction."
librandips,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,The beach is lovely and untouched. Perfect to take nice photos. Not sure if u can all the way to the bottom. 
swissmanagement1,"London, UK",Nov 2018,"Not an easy hike but certainly worth the views all the way down, most beautiful scenery in Nusa Penida Island"
Tacion83,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Nov 2018,Good place to visit in Nusa Penida. You can take car/rent bike to go there. Must visit place. We enjoyed a lot. 
Annalina,"Varberg, Sweden",Nov 2018,"The view is amazing but do not climb down the ‚Äústairs‚Äù, the ground is moving beneath your feet and the steps are made from bambu and the railings are not steady! It‚Äôs a 45 min walk/climb down to the beach. Some steps are about a meter apart. And it‚Äôs so steep! They even have a warning sign. But the beach was amazing but the current where to strong so you couldn‚Äôt go deeper than your knees. "
jas l,60 contributions,Nov 2018,"Worth to come, even the road was bad. Still in progress for improvement as per the locals. i suggest u to hire rental car with guide so you can go to many location in 1 day!  motorcycle not so recommended, but if u like adventures ride u can try üòÇ some of them get lost, can‚Äôt even find the place. not all the areas have telephones line. So my advice pay extra or u will waste all ur time & energy with the bump. "
Himawan Widyandaru,"Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Best views on nusa penida. tourist packed as expected. A very beautiful sights to see, beach is very beautiful but you need an extra stamina as the stairs to the bottom is very hard and only the one that has adrenaline that could do it. Instagram photo would be a nice purpose to visit this place, and road leads to this beach is great compare to other destination in nusa penida. Must visit indeed if you're tired with all bali chaos and kuta party scene :)"
atika s,21 contributions,Oct 2018,Its unbelievable. This place is totally amazing. Cant wait to visit it again. Don't be hesitate to ask people for the right direction. All of the locals are so friendly and nice.
ridhikh,"New Delhi, India",Oct 2018,"Must visit, if you are fit please go tho the bottom and swim in the most serene white sandy beaches. there are more than 700 steps to the bottom and then all the way up. the climb will easily take 2 hours even if you are fit"
Umesh N,"Bangkok, Thailand",Oct 2018,Most beautiful hues you can ever see. Worth the travel and must see if you are in Bali. Get a tour operator like Bali4U or directly go to Sanur beach where you can get a trip organised. Suggest you start early in the day. Pick one of the first speed boats around 7:30 or 8 and head to Nusa Penida. Better to take a hat and sunscreen as it can get quite hot and sunny
Jorden K,"Hamilton, Canada",Oct 2018,"During our three week vacation in the area of Bali, this site on Nusa Penida was undoubtedly my favourite. The view from the top was absolutely incredible. My girlfriend and I were feeling ambitious so we decided to trek down to the beach. This took approximately 40 minutes to get down as it was extremely hot and the ‚Äústairs‚Äù were quite steep. I put stairs quotations because it is in fact a narrow, steep, and uneven pathway made of jagged rocks and a hand-fashioned bamboo rail. The descent and climb back to the top were quite taxing and I would not encourage it for anyone with poor physical health.Unfortunately the beach is very wavy with strong currents so you are unable to fully get in to the water at the beach. There are drinks available at the beach but you will pay much more for them, so bring water."
Jojo_Travelers,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2018,"Klingking Beach so nice spot,you can going down but bit difficult steps going there just be careful.the beach nice and blue good for travelers!"
Lucien_LE,"Bry-sur-Marne, France",Oct 2018,"It's a beautiful spot, but there is much more to see in Nusa Penida...It is really crowded, really hard to take a decent picture without anybody on it.Better to go to Seganing waterfall, Saren Cliff Point...etc."
Laura The Explorer,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2018,Skip the tours to Nusa and head here for the day. You can trek down to the beach and really experience the scenery. Be aware that it is an hour and it not easy but it is worth it.
Bre,"Ontario, Canada",Apr 2018,"The most beautiful island coastline I've ever seen! We rented scooters on the island and the roads are so rough.. it was like mountain biking. I wiped out and broke the rearview mirrors and scratched the moped up a bit, but I only paid $20 CAD for the repairs so it wasn't too bad! I wouldn't recommend renting scooters, it would be best to have a driver, but the moment we did reach smooth roads (briefly), we were cruising along winding lush jungle roads with utmost freedom. Still, the roads were scary... I would hire a driver! Though it is still a bumpy ride."
Afiz4,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,"Came here under special package by crown tour. The time slot for each tour was too short, just enough to take photos. I will come again to swim and stay longer. The journey down to the beach is 1 hour from the top. The water looks pristine blue from the top. Definitely a sight to behold. I‚Äôll be back! "
Lauren V,"Bornem, Belgium",Oct 2018,"The view is superb from upstairs.But downstairs it is just as pretty on the beach.The hike is sometimes challeging but with some decent shoes it's not that hard, it's tougher going up than down :). But there's always ""fences"" to hold on to.Definitely worth going down!The sea is rough so I would not go far in the water, there is a lifeguard who blows a whistle when someone is getting too far."
Bryonymbrand,Wigan,May 2018,"This was something I was most looking forward to doing during my trip to Bali and it definitely didn't disappoint, in fact, it's one of the best places I've ever visited.The hike down in the heat is tough, especially given the narrow and steep steps down, but it's certainly doable and it's so worth it. I'm a seasoned hiker so breezed it but my friend is the opposite end of the spectrum and still managed with a little assistance.We hired a guide mainly because we had no idea where it was but if you can find your way around the island without then you can do it alone. I would recommend doing it early morning as there's no shade what so ever and it's baking in the midday sun.When you make it to the beach it's beautiful, clean, quiet and what you'd expect to see in a James Bond movie. I could have spent all day there.Do not miss this!"
Nicolas P,"Lima, Peru",Oct 2018,"This place is pure beauty. Another wonder that mother nature has to offer ;) Energetic and breathtaking.CAUTION: avoid going down, it is very dangerous. One bad step and consequences can be terrible. Better to enjoy the view from top because a place like this doesn‚Äôt worth it to enjoy it under stress. Otherwise you are more focused in the climb down and up, so whats the point?  I had a really bad time because i didn‚Äôt know how hard it was and needed to come back half way down (and i consider myself very adventurous btw :o). Enjoy the view!! "
Nga N,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Oct 2018,"If you have enough time and condition of health is ok, you should get down to enjoy the beach. But the way get down is not easy at all. It takes an hour to get down and maybe more than an hour to get up again. Its really exhausted. There are many people giving up at ghe half way, included me. "
Julie L,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Oct 2018,"Kelingking beach have the good ways go to there, not hard ways like Angel Billabong's. Really nice place. I dont like to pay 5.000 rupiah for 1 person and 1000 rupiah parking ... If they earn money too much, they need to repair restroom public and the ways go down on the beach too. "
Billinda1964,3 contributions,Oct 2018,"One of the best and most terrifying experiences of my life... My boyfriend and I tackled the hike down to the beach at about 9am. Not too busy at this time but still people around. The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I‚Äôve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it‚Äôs a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help. A lot of people will not be as lucky. Enjoy every minute but be safe and look after people around you. Really sad to hear about people drowning here and it happens far too often :( An amazing experience but very dangerous. :) "

Katy S,3 contributions,Sep 2018,"This is one of the most beautiful place, which I ever saw.You can also walk down to the beach.I can recommend this place, if I will have a chance I would go again!"
DjaliDjali,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida. It requires good physical condition to go up, down and up again, especially under the tropical sun. It's located quite far, 1,5 hour approximately from Sampalan, the main port to reach Nusa Penida from Sanur. Because of its popularity, to avoid the crowd, I suggest you to be here around 8 am. The earliest fast boat leaves Sanur at 7.30 with 45 minutes travel duration. So people start coming from Bali main island from 10 am approx. It'd be ideal if you spend a night in Nusa Penida and arrive early in Kelingking beach. So you can enjoy the white sandy, secluded beach on your own for some time. You take steepy stairs to go down that only fit for one person. In the busy hours, people make quite long queue waiting to go up or down in turns, one by one. The shower room isn't available on the beach, it's on the cliff. You should pay 5000 IDR to use the shower room/toilet.I wonder how grand the view would be during sunset time. If you spend a night in Nusa Penida, you can try to watch sunset here. Altough the lack of street light and poor condition of asphalt in some parts throughout the journey would be a challenge.And dear my fellow travellers, please mind your trash. The waste management here hasn't been well developed. Bring home your garbage, avoid using plastic straw & buy the mineral water in big size (1L).Happy travelling"
Zach Reep,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,Need to come here & feel the wind blows with the beautifull scenery..the road a very bad..need extra carefull..to many off road and slick rock
Katie M,26 contributions,Oct 2018,"We took a motorbike to see some of Nusa Penida‚Äôs sights. We had read about the rocky off-roading it would take to get there, but since my partner is an experienced driver we thought we could handle it. Be warned, you‚Äôll be going slowly and swerving around potholes, trucks on the wrong side, and walking your bike up slippery gravel. But in the end, it‚Äôs about the journey and this gorgeous view! Note, there are some restaurants for food and drinks at the vista. "
Andrew Black,"Newcastle, Australia",Oct 2018,This place is the best vista on Nusa Penida. I was concerned for the amount of rubbish there and over tourism.
Leuventripper,"Leuven, Belgium",Oct 2018,"I piss on everyone who doesn‚Äôt do the climb, but please be prepared. The sun is burning hot and the climb gets worse when you pass the middle to go to the beach. It‚Äôs very steep and a real challenge. Make sure to bring your own water because 1 bottle is 50,000r at the beach, and maybe some lunch. We enjoyed the hike a lot! Better not to do this with children.  Also mind the waves! They are big and very strong."
Ellen F,10 contributions,Oct 2018,"We visited Kelingking and took on the trek down the cliff edge to the beautiful beach below. As other reviewers have said you MUST wear appropriate shoes if you are taking this on. We saw many people struggling in flip flops and even saw one girl slip and fall, losing a flip flop through the gap in the fence that saved her. We wore Tevas sandals, sneakers would also be appropriate. If you're in good shape and don't mind a scramble, this should be fine for you. Avoid midday as heat can be unbearable. The worst thing (and my reason for four stars) is that the tides and waves are VERY strong. There are a few flags and a guy with a whistle but not much else to keep you safe. Would highly recommend this trip but we prepared to get dirty and tired! "
Tiny Naksha T,34 contributions,Sep 2018,"If you planing to visit Bali - Indonesia then don‚Äôt miss this place. Here are some points to make your plan easier for nusa penida.       1. You wish you can do day trip at Nusa penida or you can stay there also       2. Start your journey early at morning so you will able to catch boat      3. To Nusa Penida they have speed boat service with different timing form Sanur port, buy return ticket it will cost you near about $25/p ( there are many companies with different timing starting from 8:00am)      4. At Nusa penida you can rent bike for $5 or also you can hire 4 wheeler for $20/p         There are so many stunning places are there to explore like kelingking beach, broken island, angle bilabong, crystal bay.In kelinking beach if you wish you can go down also but path is not good at some point broken steps so be careful while getting down .. also make sure you have time because it will take almost 2hr or more to going down n come. "
snehalpatil3091,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2018,"If you are planing to visit Nusa Penida - Kelingking Beach, then follow this route for easiest and cheaper way ‚Äî 1. Go to Sanur port and buy return ticket for nusa penida ( speed boat usually run in morning ) so be there as early as possible (try to reach 7:00 am ) 2. It will take 45 min to reach nusa penida 3. Try to hire 4 wheeler with driver or bike 4. Must visit kelingking beach , broken island , angle bilabong, crystal bay ( this all places is possible to cover in a day )   If you have time then you can go down in kelingking beach but road is very stiff and broken and it will take 1 hr to go down, so manage your time before you go down .. Top view of island is just breathtaking.. most beautiful view i ever seen .. if you are planing to visit Indonesia then dont miss this place .. !!"
CharlotteKirsch,"Reading, UK",Oct 2018,"The main viewpoint is incredible. There is a 5k entrance fee per person to get in to see the view. Once in there are bars, restaurants and shops if you want to stock up on any items. The viewpoint is so beautiful, but expect to wait in a queue for ‚Äòthe‚Äô photo!If you plan to walk down to the beach then don‚Äôt wear flip flops and have sturdy shoes. The pathway isn‚Äôt very good!"
kayman99,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,T REX is only about 8 k's in a straight line from the port but it took close to an hour and a half to get there. The roads are the worst I have been on. Painful actually. A four wheel drive would struggle to get there. But once you do it is a beautiful beach as all the photos suggest. We went from there to Angels Billabong and the road was just as bad. Once again the beaches were amazing but if you don't want to sit in a hot car getting bumped around for hours I would avoid it.
meikadalton,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2018,"We stopped by and despite being surrounded by hordes of tourists, Kelingking is a stunning place to see. We didn't attempt the walk down based on the advice of our driver and after reading these reviews, I'm glad we didn't. Lovely spot for a photo opportunity. "
Soniaalp,"Reims, France",Oct 2018,Gorgeous view......But unfortunetely very touristic !! However this is a place to see when you are at Nusa Penida. 
Dawannes,"Hoogstraten, Belgium",May 2018,"This is a stone T. rex, when on the right spot, you can walk to the beach down there, but it‚Äôs scary "
sermar99,"Oakland Park, FL",Sep 2018,"It is not easy to get there, but the views are out of this planet.  Scotters, driving on a very bad roads, but if you are careful, you will make it.  Amazing view. Beach, ocean, mountains, and blue sky.  IF you go to Indonesia, do not miss this one."
osky1900,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Oct 2018,"The views from the top of the cliff are amazing, the colour of the sea looks as if someone have filter it.But before you start to think about climbing down to the beach I'd like you to know that I did it and being on shape and exercising twice per week I'm not sure i'd repeat the tour Going down is dangerous because of the narrow and very rampped path which is ""secured"" very poorly with ropes and bamboo canes, in most of the steps you advance 3 meters down at least. It is most climbing than walking.But the main problem comes when you are at the beach and you have to climb up...it is exhausting. Bring sneakers and water with you. And becareful with the sea water. It is not a beach to have a quiet bath, the waves and strong water streams could make it impossible."
Explore820122,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2018,Located on the southern island of Nusa Penida from above it will look like a beautiful southern sea.the beauty of nature here will make us forget how hot the weather is here
Dream820525,7 contributions,Sep 2018,"Beautiful views, nature is just amazing. In case you want to go down, be sure to wear sneakers as the path is really narrow and rough. It probably takes you one hour or so to go all the way down to the beach. We only went half the way because we didn't have time and we had only flip flops with us."
Hannah G,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2018,"So worth the trip! Our driver took us on a tour of Angels Billabong, Broken Beach, Kelingking and Crystal Bay and it was a perfect day out. Roads are bumpy though so expect this. Our tour cost 650,000 total and we hired the driver from our hotel (Arsa Santhi)."
Jackson Lo,"New York City, NY",Sep 2018,"The journey here by road was rough, but in the end the breathtaking view cancels that all out. This is definitely a once in a lifetime experience."
Gimhani Kavindya Baduge,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Most beautiful spot to take pictures in bali.. after accidents happened recently they have put a stick fence... which makes it bit safe... however the place is so scenic and anyone visiting Bali should never miss this one.
Nusa Penida Exploration,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Sep 2018,It's very interesting and wonderful place to explore and experience the nature beauty of the Kelingking beach.
lifesabeach108,"South Devon, UK",Sep 2018,Absolutely incredible view a must when in Bali a short boat trip from sanur then lembongan And a very bumpy 1hr drive 
xxNiiaxx,"Wil, Switzerland",Sep 2018,amazing view - amazing landscape.. I'm still in love with this place :-) you could hike to the little beach below and it's absolutely worth it!

I also would not risk swimming in the ocean. could be used for that."
Alaksander,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2018,"The view itself is breathtaking. Take your time to take in the amazing view, bask in the sun and breathe in the sea breeze. Don't forget to look closely into the bay. We spotted 13 Mantas gliding the ocean waves freely.One of the most amazing views in Nusa Penida."
Sjur,"Bergen, Norway",Sep 2018,"A must see in Nusa Penida! The viev is amazing, you clearly see the t-rex head, and you also see manta rays swimming around down there. It's a tough walk down, but if you're up for it, then it's worth it. "
leashyjelly,"London, UK",Sep 2018,"Treacherous 45 minute walk/CLIMB down the cliff face. With nothing but branches and bamboo rails between you and 400m fall! The beach itself is gorgeous, lots of shady places to lounge while it cools down before you conquer the horrific walk back up. but the waves make it not great for swimming.with nothing but a ‚Äúbeach man‚Äù equipped with a long stick incase of emergencies i would never recommend end swimming here.Unfortunately while we were on the beach a local boy got swept out to sea and drowned while everyone watched helpless. His body did not resurface for 30 minutes when it was too late. Absolutely tragic so again i stress DO NOT SWIM here. "

Sonya March,63 contributions,Apr 2018,Dinosaur ü¶ñ cave ever!!! This is my first destination when I was in Bali. You can walked to the beach down there just 1 hrs. Although I went on summertime but is not too hot . Cool breeze and summer fresh air. Superb!!!!
Drizzels,"Leuven, Belgium",Sep 2018,"Yes its true, the road is terrible. But only like max 1km. We went around 11am and there were almost no other vehicles on the road so you can use the whole road and choose the best path. Take your time and it's absolutely doable with a scooter. The view itself is beautiful and worth the drive. It gets crowded really quick so go as early as possible. We left around 12.30pm and all the busses with tourists were getting dropped off. "
Greeshma96777,14 contributions,Sep 2018,"It is the best view one will see while visiting Bali.  Palm for atleast half a day.  Trekking down to the beach takes some toll and one needs to be reasonably fit to trek down to reach the beach. Do carry few Bintangs in the back back,  trek down and enjoy s yourself in the beach"
Am_miri-am_miri,46 contributions,Sep 2018,if you want to get down to the beach - please wear good shoes! Otherwise it can get quite tricky I guess (I watched other people's faces)
AlunHutoyo,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"All the bumpy roads to get here was worth it. If you are not an expert motorbike rider, you better get a car rent and driver. Bring along your hiking shoes/sandals to going down the beach. The view from above was spectacular and the cliff looks like tyrannosaur üòÅ"
CaiaCam,"Fontana, CA",Aug 2018,"challenging and steep 1 Km hike to the bottom, but worth it. Don't go if you have a fear of heights. And wear sneakers. Don't forget your snorkel.  It costs money to use the toilet, but I think the fee is included with most tours."
Elli,Norway,Feb 2018,"The place is absolutely stunning. The earlier the better, I think in a couple of years it will be too crowdy and touristy.A must see if you are  at nusa penida. The road to it is horrible though. "
Jerre_Stead,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"Kelingking Beach is one of the best beaches on Nusa Penida, you can easily get here by motorbike but be careful as most the roads on the small island can be a little rough. There is a small fee for parking as most scenic places. There are small snack shops and places to buy a beer at the top. The trip down the trail can be a bit much for some people as it is steep and the railings are just old pieces of bamboo tied together so go slow if you're not comfortable. The beach at the bottom is amazing but be careful as the waves can get pretty intense! Most of all have fun and takes pictures of this amazing place!!"
Mohd Edzle,"Sungai Buluh, Malaysia",Sep 2018,If you‚Äôre in Bali.. I recommend you to come to this place. For sure you had unbelievable experience here
Joko P,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"so beautiful view from the top, many photo spot, but for some of the best they will charge you Rp.5.000. better you come early, before 9 am, if you not you will see a crowded photo spot and long cueing to go down."
Melissa B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2018,"Breath taking views from the top and if you choose to walk down... you're in for an adrenaline rush to say the least! The narrow walkway down is ""fenced"" with bamboo and some parts are damn near vertical that steps have been cut into the rock. Ironically, we walked down in bare feet as jandals (flip flops) felt far too unsafe. Once down at the beach you could go for a swim however we found the powerful swell intimating so only dipped our feet. Back at the top there are places to buy cold drinks (lifesaver! lol) The whole experience of the views and the walk itself was a highlight of our Bali trip."
Stevo,83 contributions,May 2018,"I am not easily impressed. But seeing this had staring with my mouth opened and goosebumps on my skin. The waves down there look like they are moving in slow motion. It was quite an adventure to ride my rented scooter up there through all those curves in the hills. But totally worth it. If Bali is on your list, this should be a point of interest!"
Caleymay,"Seongnam, South Korea",Sep 2018,"This cliff face offers an amazing view point of the beach below. We didn't hike down there as its a LONG walk down and up!! However, definitely visit for the view as its spectacular!!"

Its amazing how a tourism industry is set up because of a pretty sight.. there are many warungs at the site with many stalls set up selling drinks and coconut. "
Tiia T,"Helsinki, Finland",Sep 2018,"We visited Kelinking Beach during the evening, when the sun was setting around 6 PM. The views looked just awesome and T-Rex was cute as hell! It's incredible how nature has created something this beautiful. So if you are in Nusa Penida, you should check this out. If you are afraid of heights, be aware. Although it seems like it's so high you just can't even realize anymore how high it is. We didn't go down the stairs, since there were a lot of people. There were lot of tourists on top of the beack too, but not so many that you couldn't just take in the views and enjoy.There are some scams (at least they feel like scams) on the beach by locals, so be aware. Our guide actually adviced us couple of times to climb ladders into this little wooden thing, where you could take selfies with a better view. So we did althought the wooden thing didn't look so special. When we came down, the local lady was asking us for 5 k per person. It was written with a shaky handwriting on a very little sign next to the ladders. We paid, as it isn't that much, but I just felt fooled. I feel like this kind of ""take a picture here and pay 5/10 k"" are just one big scam. Entrance fees are okay if the proceeds go into the maintenance/property management, but otherwise... Please stop, this is not that appealing to tourists since it lefts you only with a feeling of being fooled."
Mark Joven,"Quezon City, Philippines",Sep 2018,I have to say my favorite spot in Nusa Penida island and worth going especially if you‚Äôll have time going down to the beach. The view from the top is amazing ans I‚Äôm pretty sure the experience going down the beach would be amazing. If you‚Äôre afraid of heights then try to be brave and strong if you want to have a perfect Instagram shot because by just merely sitting at the cliff is nerve braking. It‚Äôs really beautiful and it made me want to come back to Bali ASAP. You should try it and i tell you it‚Äôs worth it 
Cioarba H,"Reghin, Romania",Sep 2018,Nusa Penida Island is a place that you have to see beaxuse is very wild. There are not so many buildings and you can see a lot of tropical forest. 
Arlene J,"Jersey City, NJ",Sep 2018,This beach was beautiful! We did not venture down to the bottom but many people did. It is definitely a must see in Bali. Such an amazing view from the top! 
David R,43 contributions,Aug 2018,"I still don't think I've seen something that spectacular anywhere else in the world. It's getting more and more touristic, yes, but because of obvious reasons..."
Nyein Ei Ei L,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",Aug 2018,"It is an highlight of Nusa Penida. It is just wonderful place. I hired a car and I need to pass steep and bumpy road to get this amazing place. But when I get there, I forgot everything and just amazed by this wonder. I really really loved it."
Pinkieferris,76 contributions,Sep 2018,Kelingking Beach was the first stop on my tour of the east coast of this natural wonder of Nusa Penida and the views of Kelingking  beach were spectacular - if you‚Äôre brave enough navigate your way down the staircase for about 25 minutes and see the stunning beach up close and personal. Not to be missed if you visit the island! 
sedigheh_kh,Iran,Aug 2018,"Stunning view but crowded, full of tourist and if you want to take a photo you should wait for long .But breath taking view.You have to visit this place as the best part of nusa penidaa."
samareaiya,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",Jul 2018,This is the best out of all remarkable places in Nusa Penida Island. It‚Äôs simply out of this world. A must visit place if you are Bali.
Dana P,"Bangkok, Thailand",Aug 2018,"It is where heaven and hell meet. The beach is heavenly and offers a natural shade under what seems to be a cave. Water is a mix of blue and green, huge waves and white sands. However reaching the beach itself is hell, a very difficult road down a big mountain. I think it‚Äôs worth it but make sure you have enough time down there. "
NatashaT91,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2018,"We woke up at 6AM specifically so that we could have the place to ourselves, and we are so happy we did. Beautiful views, and easy trek down and up. Spent some time by the beach and marveled at the huge waves. By the time we were nearing the top again (around 9AM) the stairs started to get really busy, which seemed like a nightmare (there's really only room for one person at a time). I think it would have been a totally different experience if we had left later.Also I think there are weird parking (scams?) that make you pay if you arrive later. We found them all over Penida, but they weren't around in the morning."
Samantha M,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2018,"Riding a 2 wheeler motor bike to get to these locations by yourself is very tricky, the roads are so bad!! we had a fall on one of the roads and we happened to be the 4th biker that had a fall on that same stretch, luckily we were not as badly injured as the others so we managed to proceed with caution towards our destination as the roads just kept getting worse in condition - unless you are staying overnight on nusa penida ensure you make it back to the ferry port on time for the last boat atleast (we made it just in time with 2 minutes to spare) - once you arrive nusa penida by boat best hire a local biker and let him ride / hire a car.Kelingking - pay for parking - no entry fee - lot of stamina needed - you have to wonder how those bamboo stick fences were even built by some really really brave hearts!! you have to shuffle through people on your way down as many stop in between contemplating if they should continue further. we stopped half way ourselves and did not make it to the beach as we had to race back to the port to make it in time for our boat! but i am sure it would have been a very private beach as not many go right to the bottom. The view is breathtaking & the experience is exhilarating so expect to be tired at the end of this."
bharti7980,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2018,Just a short half hour drive from Angel billabong.. This place offers stunning views. Also the road is well maintained.  Our driver dropped us at the top to get the views.. However you can also walk down the stairs to reach the bottom Sandy beach.. 
Christian W,"Hamburg, Germany",Feb 2018,"One of many Highlights in Nusa Penida.The way to this scenic view was rough - it took us a lot of skill with our bikes to go there, but it was fun! At the end, we had a great view on the famous T-Rex ;) I was flying my drone to get some great shots (since my girlfriend was too afraid to climb the ""stairs"" down the hill). On good days you can see the Mantas in the Manta Point!!Do it - it's worth the effort!"
Staffan N,"Stockholm, Sweden",Aug 2018,"For sure, this place is nice but be prepared to push your way through a bunch of people. Be careful as there no fence that will stop you to fall 100 meters...Be prepared to stand in line for some minutes to get to the spot where you can take the best picture. Going down to the beach and up will take 2 hours.Seems like this place attracts a lot of Chinese people, so you might want to be prepared for that as well... "
akshaymay2981,"Raipur, India",Aug 2018,"It took me 20 mins to walk bare foot down a steep inclined of rocks with only a woobly bamboo railing as safety .

WanderingAmbitions,"London, UK",Aug 2018,"Absolutely stunning beach and a must see. My poor rating comes down to the rubbish littered around, lines of instagrammers and the stalls which somewhat dampens the experience.To get down to the beach is tough hike, you can see manta rays if you look off the cliff to the left side (when looking at the sea) and the road is bumpy but manageable if on scooter."
duzelpanda,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2018,Your must-visit bucket list at Nusa Penida. This place will be full of tourists in the afternoon so you'd better reach this place in the early morning or late evening to get the best picture. You also need an extra stamina to reach the beach down there.
MikeandSandra7,Melbourne,Aug 2018,Yes to arrive at this destination you will travel on the worst road on Nusa Penida. I ride motorbikes back home and are confident on a scooter but we decided to enjoy the scenery on the way in so we hired a driver. The views from the top are absolutely stunning on a clear day and make for some great photos. If you want to walk down the steps for ‚Äòthat photo‚Äô then be prepared to wait in line. This is another place where you want to arrive as early as possible. As we were leaving there was a constant stream of vehicles arriving.When walking back to the car park keep looking out to the ocean as we say around 7 Manta Rays swimming in the clear blue waters below. Also buy some bananas from the local vendors and feed the local monkeys. If you come all the way to Nusa Penida you need to come here.
Domrand,78 contributions,Aug 2018,"This place is absolutely beautiful the water is so blue and the view is breathtaking just be aware if you‚Äôre going to hike down to the beach it‚Äôs more of a Rock climb than I hike, wear suitable footwear and bring some water! There is a little stall at the bottom that sells drinks but there soooo expensive! (50k for a bottle of water) And be careful in the waves as they are extremely powerful"
TravelAngler725,"Seoul, South Korea",Aug 2018,"Kelingking is most famous for looking like the shape of a t rex, but once you've gone down to the beach, you will remember this hike for the grueling, yet rewarding, experience it truly is. A few disclaimers. Do not hike using slippers. You are better off going barefoot, which is what I did, or using some serious hinking shoes. Check the bamboo before you pull yourself up. It is not all sturdy. Above all go slowly, be in good physical condition and you will be fine. If you aren't up to the journey you can enjoy the spectacular views. WhenI went, there was a school of large fish easily visible from the cliff. If you do make the journey, reward yourself with a refreshing soak in the ocean (and powerful waves that come with it!)"
Melissa R,26 contributions,Feb 2018,"The way down to the beach was closed when we went, but some ignored the sign and went down anyways. It's really steep and there are no real stairs or anything. We just went for the picture and that's all you can really do there. It's pretty, but becoming cliche. "
Heine K,"Trondheim, Norway",Aug 2018,"Getting down is not recommended if you're not in shape or afraid of heights. Even if you are, take care and make sure your footing is good.The trip down is an experience in itself, but so worth it. Most beautiful beach I've been to."
MaggieStar,"Malm√∂, Sweden",Aug 2018,"The road there is terrible, pls be careful. Go slowly, no rush. The view is amazing. The walk down and up the beach is really hard and difficult. Up is like crawling or rockclimbing. 45min each way. Pls wear sneakers for your own safety. The Beach is like paradise, but strong current and Waves. Def worth a visit!"
I3eren,"Stuttgart, Germany",Aug 2018,"That is the best beach on Nusa Penida, a real paradise, but you should be careful when going down. For us it was no problem, because we had trailrunning shoes, but i think its only a matter of time until someone with flip flops will slip and might get hurt. There always is a kind of ‚Äûfence‚Äú made of sticks, bound together with ropes, that is really solid. So you can do it, but be careful!"
Nerina P,"Santorini, Greece",Aug 2018,"Best place to see. Amazing view! Paradise! Trip to the beach is about1.30 min down and up. Stairs are preaty steep, we didn't go down. A must see! "
ljprocter,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, UK",Jul 2018,It is quite a hike to down to the breathtaking white sand beach at the bottom of the TRex shaped cliff formation but it is important to note that the view from above is just as spectacular. Top Tip: try and find your own little viewpoint not where the crowd is.
langelino,"Stormville, NY",Jul 2018,"Got there first thing in the morning, was not crowded yet, but I can see it getting packed.  If you want to go down to the beach you need very good shoes, and probably an hour to get down, not easy."
Dinushka U,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Jun 2018,"If you visit Bali, this is must visit place. Beautiful view and once you climb down, you will see the beautiful beach with clear water. "
Thomas B,5 contributions,Aug 2018,We came early (9 am) and avoidet the crowds on our way down which was very nice considering the narrow and at times pretty vertical hike. Bring practical shoes and bags - and be aware of the tides.So beautiful!
David O,"Yerevan, Armenia",Aug 2018,We had a long way to the Kelingking beach and we were tired but the view was amazing and the beach itself was great. Must see place for me.
chad w,"Helena, MT",May 2018,The view from top overlooking Kelingking  was great.  The travel via scooter getting to this location was a adventure with good roads and bad roads..the last 15 minutes were worst(dirt road and very bumpy and poor) getting to this location:  This is becoming popular place to see so there was quite a few tour groups and vehicles when you get close to this location.   The hike to Beach below was extreme and I thought to myself after I got halfway down this is going to get easier now.  Ha Ha.  It was more intense (I thought if you fall you will die steep with only bamboo strapped railing next to path down) It got much hotter on lower half as well in afternoon.     (Hint bring water and good shoes)   The beach on bottom was amazing with perfect sand and perfect water.  The hike out was not as bad as hike in since its easier to climb then descend since you can use your hands.  It was worth the hike but I would not do this again since it was difficult and I climb to top of mountains where I live a lot.
jrox1,"Hartford, CT",Jul 2018,"We visited Kelingking Beach with Discover Nusa Penida's Manta Mix Tour - it is truly a must-see.  We did not hike down to the beach, as we wanted to see other sites in our afternoon tour, but the view from the top is beautiful.  We could see mantas swimming in the bay from the cliff!"
Tonykhoa,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Jul 2018,"OMG, so nice and so beautiful. I do not know why, it's so beautiful. Really just know it is very beautiful, and wonderful. You have to live here once in your life. to see, to see the real beauty of it"
becky1007,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2018,"We visited Kelingking when the weather was really bad, and our hotel & guide told us to not go down to the beach under any circumstances. Worth baring in mind when planning your trip.We ventured down the stairs a little way, but is probably not suitable for families with young children, as we struggled with climbing down and back up. They aren't properly built stairs, its dug out into the cliff face, with bamboo as handrails thats not secure in some places, and very VERY steep.The views from the top are amazing though, though the waves were bad it was a clear day and we could see for miles! Also worth baring in mind how youre getting to Kelingking, as the roads are the worst! After speaking to other travellers they recommended getting a car there instead of riding the scooters there, and we're glad we listened! The road was broken in quite a few places, and some places it was just gravel!Beautiful place though, would recommend "
456ollis,4 contributions,Jul 2018,"Advice, pack sneakers! Great view, hazardous journey. Don't go here wearing flip flops. Also, have a backpack and water. "
Thiago F,"Heathcote, Australia",Jul 2018,"The Place is stunning, amazing view, beautiful nature, the colours are spectacular!  Definitely you need to visit this spot, but get ready to adventure, go down to the beach is not an easy task, you have to go down through a narrow path of stairs built from sticks and mud, and sometimes theres is traffic on your way down, because of the crescent number of tourists visiting the place!!"
Fabienne A,32 contributions,Jul 2018,Must see on Nusa Penida! Very impressiv! Next to the most hotspots on Nusa Penida. Would recommend to go by car due to the difficult streets.
e-hewitt1,"Laholm, Sweden",Jun 2018,The ocean was every shade of blue and turquoise possible. It was so lovely but the climb was sweaty but definitely worth it.
Matt D,"Modave, Belgium",Jul 2018,"Lovely place, very nice pictures there. But go further than that and take your time to visit the South of the island too. It's worth it and you will see more than the 2 touristic places everyone goes to."
sunridge8,"Palmwoods, Australia",Jul 2018,"The view is spectacular but the road out to here is horrendous. We hired a driver and felt very sorry for anyone who attempted it on a scooter. Also if you can go early you will be rewarded with lighter crowds. We didn't attempt the stairs down to the divine beach, but if you are brave enough to face the 'stairs' then you would love the beach area."
Trav,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Kelingking beach is just something you have to see to believe, it is amazing. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the manta rays swimming around at the beach below. A few things to note:The road out to Kelingking is rough, if you decide to do it on a scooter you should be careful as there are a lot of bumps, rocks, soft sand and taxis to contend with. I have heard that the taxi/tour van ride out is quite rough also but if you aren't confident on a scooter then I suggest taking a tour or taxi.This is the number one attraction on Nusa Penida so it gets very busy, if you stay on the island I recommend going early before the boats bring in day tourists.The best view is from the top, but you can hike down to the beach but be warned that it is not an easy one, I recommend wearing sneakers/runners for extra grip and just for feet protection.Areas of the hike down are super steep and quite difficult to negotiate so take your time. Plenty of people do this hike so there are sections where you will have to stop and wait to let people pass you. Be considerate of others and lend them a hand when it's safe to do so. This is a cliffs side you are climbing down which has little shade and sometimes no wind so it gets very hot. Once you make it down to the beach, there is one person who is selling some drinks and snacks but don't expect to have a wide variety and you will pay slightly more then you would normally. It would be wise to take some water and snacks with you. The beach is not necessarily a swim friendly beach, no life guards patrol the beach, the waves can be quite big and come from different directions. If you aren't a strong swimmer I highly advise you don't go in very deep. I swam out into the water and got to swim with some rays which was awesome. It was hard to get in and out safely and I am a strong swimmer.This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so if you do decide to do it. Be safe, take your time and take your rubbish with you. "
WinduRadityo,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"I went to Nusa Penida recently, and my tour guide bring me to this spot on the first time. I only take a few pictures from above, it's so beautiful. We can see a clear sea-view and you can look mantaray from above.The landscape just like a view from Jurrasic World the movie. The small island  so iconic.  I don't explore too much in this area. "
peeacee,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Get your butt out there, do the tiring hike down and back up. Just wow. The views are AMAZING. Parking around the corner is free but parking on site is 5000 or 10000 IDR for motorbike. If anything, I feel like the money should go towards the maintenance of the walkway down. THe local people deserve to be paid for that incredible work :)"
chris m,7 contributions,Jun 2018,"Quite a walk down a narrow trail, but well worth the beautiful beach.  Go snorkeling with the Nusa Penida Tour group.  They are the best!"
YadnyaBali,"Ungasan, Indonesia",Oct 2017,For those who manage to climb 400 meters down will find extraordinary experience. Very secluded and amazing cliffs surrounding. Beware of the waves not recommended for swimming for beginners
amy j,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Jun 2018,"I love the view! Every bit of it. It‚Äôs just too many tourist. And to get there is a bit complicated. I don‚Äôt really suggest you guys to go there by scooter. The road is not as what you expected. If you want to hike down the beach, make sure you wear a suitable shoes. The duration is about 2 hours. Maybe 1 hour if you‚Äôre a hiker. "
52mahesha,16 contributions,Jul 2018,Very nice place .. beautiful view .. lovely place.. u need to walk down the stair to get to the beach for half hour.. but overall very good view .. good place take some photo for memories..
Wasim Shaikh,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2017,"It is the most breathtaking view of sea beach and mountain. The path to beach is very dangerous, if you are expert in trekking you should not miss the opportunity of going down the hill to enjoy the beach with crystal clear sand and water all for only yourself. You can see the stingray fish in this place. Most attractive spot in Nusa Penida. Hotels and restaurants are coming up, pack your meals if you intend to spend the day in Kelingking beach. "
Johan Kinoshita,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"The Place is very picturesque with the T-Rex shaped rocks. You can go down the hill and play the beach, it‚Äôs pretty steep but really good beach! The water is crystal clear and there is abundant manta! Great place to go afternoon and watch sunset. Entry fee per car 10k"
MariaVania,Sydney,Jun 2018,"Climbing down and up the cliff is not for the faint hearted so be warned, bring water, sunscreen and a hat. The beach however is stunning!"
Paul M,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jul 2018,A real sight to behold. The litter all around is an absolute disgrace. A real sad reflection on the visitors! The local authority should increase the meagre surcharge for touring vehicles to enter and use this to train staff to manage the area and enforce anti littering with stringent fines with the added benefit of creating jobs for local villagers 
SANDRA K,8 contributions,Jun 2018,Its really amazing..to go there you need transportation..its a bit difficult to get there.better when you arrived in nusa penida rent a car or bike.
caseylim1990,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2018,This place is just amazing!!! The cliffs and the sea. Went over on a scooter and the road condition was good. Only regret was we didn't have enough time to hike down the cliff to get to the beach. Will definitely be back and head down to the beach for a dip!
yugraj s,8 contributions,Jun 2018,"Astonishing view of not just the T rex pount but also of few of the cliffs on the opposite side, on eof them being banah cliff in the sea. It has a wonderful beach down there but with some dangerous waves, and the way down is quite adventurous , i wouldn‚Äôt say too dangerous because its not a long way down or up, its steep but a lot of old people were able to go through it, but yes beach and the view is magnificent but comes with some really dangerous waves. "
Magnus Jensen,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jul 2018,"We were two danish guys going to Kelingking Beach. We had heard great stuff about the tourist attraction, but got quite surprised anyway. First of all, the trip down the hill was steeper and more difficult than we expected. However, we managed to get down, which is the most challenging way, in 30 min. and it was totally worth it. The beach is beautiful and the water crystal clear. Moreover, it has to be said that it took us 12 min. to get up again. So if you consider going to Kelingking Beach, we will definitely recommend it even though it requires that you are not afraid of getting sweaty. "
cent629,"Dallas, TX",Jun 2018,"The most incredible views from the top, on the way down and on the beach. Went down with my 12 year old son and 15 year old daughter. Almost vertical decent in some places but there is a lot of bamboo structure to hold on to the whole way. About 20 mins down and probably a bit frightening for most in some places. The beach is incredible and secluded. The way up is much more strenuous but not as worrysome. If you can handle it, its well worth the journey."
GolakaNath,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2018,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here. From Kelingking cliff we drove to Crystal Bay to see the sunset."
Khadija K,34 contributions,Jun 2018,The journey to get to Kelingking beach is very rough. Do not take a bike you will have a difficult time. If you have a toddler this journey may get tricky. However once you reach the view is amazing. Beautiful rock formation and the colour of the sea is breathtaking. It‚Äôs difficult and dangerous to go down to the beach and we were happy seeing the view from the top.

Desmoon K,2 contributions,May 2018,"if you really want to have unforgettable experience, try the motorcycle when you are on the Nusa Penida island. the challenge is the road condition, you need some skills on some spots to balance your ride on some rocky, dusty road. along the riding, you can enjoy the viewit will take an hour from the harbor. don't afraid of getting lost, you can use GPS. it is suggested for a day trip, to start from Kelingking Beach then go to other spots and make Crystal Bay as the last spot before turning to the harbor. the last speed boat will be at 5 PM. and yes start early in the morning by taking first speed boat schedule from Sanur Beach. The Sanur beach will be very crowded, be there 30 minutes prior the departure as you will need sometimes to find the meeting point between the crowd. Kelingking Beach will give you amazing view! you can go down the beach but will take some efforts. easy to go down there but really challenging when going up. for the famous spot to take the kelingking beach that you usually see on Instagram, if it's in peak season, probably you will get in line for taking pictures as so many people want to take picture."
Ana P,"Luxor, Egypt",Jun 2018,Kelingking Beach has an amazing view!! But they never tell that you will need almost 1 hour in a terrible pathway to reach it by car. So if you have a young child... I would not recommend it! 
chiarabarrasso,"Paris, France",Jun 2018,"Kelingking beach is clearly one of the most beautiful place I have ever seen! The view on the beach is breathtaking! You can even see the Manta raies swimming in the crystal water! Also you can go down to the beach, a beautiful beach with white sand! It will take you 30 min but it worths it!"
FoodVenturer,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"We went here on the first day of our visit in Nusa Penida this Jun and it was the most surreal experience. The place was crawling with tourists but it didn‚Äôt bother us because the view was breathtaking. We wanted to go down the beach but it was pretty far away and we didn‚Äôt wear the appropriate shoes (I only had sandals on). If you wish to go down to the beautiful beach below, make sure you wear sport shoes to be safe. Going down would be not that difficult (as long as you‚Äôre careful) but getting up would be an ultra long and tiresome journey, so make sure you have enough water and energy when you come here.I really hope to go down on my next visit!"
OrestePaven,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Jun 2018,"The beach is fantastic, even though we had not been down and we regret it. Definetly a must in Nusa Penida. There is full of people but you can find the space for yourself."
Zeeshan D,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2018,"We left our hotel at 730 am to beat the tour traffic and boy were we right! Took us an hour since it also rained a bit on the way. The Trex can be viewed from the view point which is right at the parking spot. But if you‚Äôre physically fit and adventurous, take the hike down the scary wood plank stairway to the beach!It was the most wonderful experience after a gruelling 30 minute hike down to see how empty and untouched the beach was. Pure natural beauty at its finest. You can go for a dip but the tide was strong. There is also surprisingly, a vendor who comes down around 845 am with snacks and drinks that you can buy from. Overall- PENIDA was made worth the money and effort solely because of this natural wonder"
Fatin,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2018,One of my favorite view! Amazing view from the beach and top. Be careful going up and down. If you are not fit dont worry. Just hold all this woods around you. Very big wave! Few tourist trying to swim but this big wave can pull you back into the water! Its worth it and you should try it one time in your life!! 
bunartowu,3 contributions,Jun 2018,"The view from the hilltop is nice and all. But the fun begins when u descend the hills to the beach below. It is tiring and hard, but totally worth it! Make sure u bring enough water with you to descend and to climb back up! And don't wear slippers because I have seen many slippers snapped along the way."
Cecilie C,"Valby, Denmark",Jun 2018,We enjoyed the view and took the trek down halfway. We also saw mantas swimming around at the bottom. Highly recommend it. Luckily most of the rude tourists dont go that far down the trek and you get some quite time ;) 
Zdenƒõk K,19 contributions,Jun 2018,"Just wow, thing place has one of the best views, which I enjoyed as much as I can. Beautiful art of nature!"
Van T,"Helsinki, Finland",Jun 2018,"This is a must-see when you're on Nusa Penida. I love how easy it was to get to this place. The roads were much better than the ones to Broken Beach. With a small parking price for my scooter (5000 Rupiah), I could enter the area. The view from the top was spectacular. But I enjoyed even more the stairs down the ""T-rex's back"" to the beach. Some people may find it quite challenging but to me it was really fun. "
asriniruth,Indonesia,Jun 2018,"This is so beautiful and amazing view, and definitely the must-see place when you visit Nusa Penida.So majestic and breathtaking view. Love it!"
enru s,3 contributions,Apr 2018,"It's like 1,5 to 2 hours from the Nusa Penidas's ferry harbor, to reach there you also have to go through 1 hour of bumpy roads, not quite a suitable destination if you bring a baby.From above it's an epic view.There's a hidden beach below but going down is rather extreme, just be careful not to slip"
Varun Saxena,"Bengaluru, India",Jun 2018,The view is beautiful from the top but its a treacherous hike down to the beach. Not for the faint-hearted. But worth going even if you see it from the top.
temitravel,"Quebec City, Canada",Jun 2018,Pictures don't do this place justice. Hike down to the beach. Stay the night in Nusa Peneda and come early or near sunset to avoid the crowds of people posing for instagram selfies.
Rirukunir,"Tangerang, Indonesia",May 2018,"It's really amazing when you reach this place. We just like see heaven and paradise. The shape of cliff like a T-Rex which is very interesting. Blue ocean is the view in front of the cliff, very clear and clean beach. üòçüòçüòçActually we can go down for swimming activity or just taking photo in the beach instead of on top of the cliff, but it needs around 1 hour by walking down. Since I'm in a rush of hour to go other places, maybe next time I'll do it.Overall, it takes around 30 min from Nusa Penida port to Kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do off-road. So, I'd suggest that a pregnant woman to do not join this trip due to safety reason. Hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. üôèüèªBesides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited. According to my local guide, there's only 1 star hotel near the Nusa Penida port. The others are only available for bungalows and homestay."
ongko_budihartanto,15 contributions,Jun 2018,It's a very extra ordinary place for us. The view was so amazing not only to take the extra ordinary pictures but also the extra ordinary experience. Because you will get both the views of beach from very high cliff and also the views of the very beautiful beach down the cliffs.
Rituraj B,16 contributions,Jun 2018,Amazing view but it was too much crowded. One of the beaches you can visit while you are staying in Lembongan or Penida. 
mitageorge,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2018,"This my first time went to this iconic beach. And this is one of my wishlist in penida,unfortunately due to time limitation i didn't go to reach the sand because it really need a big effort.

–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å –ú,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",Jun 2018,Better and closer than Atuh beach. Ferry service is terrible and spoiled all emotions of visiting. If you already at Nusa Penida it must be visited. But I do not advice go Nusa Penida at all
dean c,"Eaton, Australia",Jun 2018,"Hhmmm this ones hard, if ur super fit go for it , if not then move on... Wat u have to do is a long drive off the main island road to start with, then u turn left onto the ‚Äúgoat road‚Äù and very steep only try this on a scooter if u Know how to ride... after a cpl of kms of bumpy steep track u get to a bit where even the locals tell u Park here it‚Äôs too dangerous to take scooter past this point ... we‚Äôll after all that ur about  half way there, then U have to slip an slide down more steep hills just to get to the Stairs, then the fun starts   There‚Äôs hundreds of stairs to get down to the Half way point ..... but if u succeed in making it this far u will be rewarded with an oasis of a Freshwater swimming hole that is Fantastic frickin awesome!!!!!! And the after chillin in the rock billabong and u still have more energy u can continue down more steps to the beach But don‚Äôt surprised if there isn‚Äôt any beach cause the tide comes in very quickly .... Now the reeeal  fun bit starts all over again, u thought coming down 100‚Äôs of steps was fun .... try going back up , then the slippery path, then back on the scooter for uphill goat track adventure ..... But if u finally make it back out alive, I guarantee u the only thing Ull  remember is that bloody awesome Freshwater swimming hole and cliffs around it .... Good luck üòâ.  Ull need it "
DSN68,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,a bit scary to go down but it is amazing to make it. Definitely recommend to come. Need to improve some security for tourists
Megan E,29 contributions,Jun 2018,Had been looking forward to going to this location for over 8 months as all of my favorite travel bloggers have been here. I wasn‚Äôt expecting the waters to be as blue as in pictures figuring they had all been filtered. I am telling you it looks even better in real life. The water is so so blue and the cliffs are beautiful! We hiked all the way down to the bottom and it was tough but worth it. Bring water though because coming back up was tough. Such an amazing spot on this island. 
aurelie S,12 contributions,Jun 2018,"Going to Kelinking beach is quite an experience. First the road to get there is in really bad condition. So if you are not comfortable with a motor bike, choose a trip with a driver.And if you decide to take the stairs down to the beach, be careful the descent is not easy. You better pack light, and be prepare for a steep climb back.But the view is stunning from the top and once on the beach, you feel like you are in a little paradise."
Thea M,25 contributions,Jun 2018,"Kelingking Beach has an incredible view! It's a  must see in Nusa Penida. You'll need to take a boat ride of around 45 mins from Sanur to Nusa Penida. From there, it's about 1.5 hour drive to kelingking beach. It is an extremely bumpy ride so I recommend you to take medicine if you have motion sickness. The beach is about 1-1.5 hour hike and is very steep."
PK Das,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,"The beauty of this place is simply heaven on earth. Extremely beautiful & scenic. Unfortunately the access to the beach down is not comfortable at all. This is the one place one should visit Nusa Penida & also try to reach the beach down.Time for the Government to seriously think about building the access to the beach, may be an Elevator with fee would be a good option."
Kelli M,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Jun 2018,Kelingking Beach is stunning. Turquoise waters and white sand. From the top you can see the whole beach. We weren‚Äôt game to try the walk down to the beach but there were a few people who did. It is not for the faint of heart some people needed to be rescued while we were there. Definitely add this to your list when visiting Nusa Penida
Thom P,"Bovenkarspel, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"The views here are gorgeous, kind of looks like a T-rex with some imagination. Make sure you get here early because you don‚Äôt wanna be stuck climbing due to all the other tourist taking countless selfies. Don‚Äôt stop halfway down, continue on to the harder part and get down to the beach. I advies you to wear shoes cause the climb is kind of steap but really worth it"
Jennifer SF,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2018,"Long scooter ride there, but definitely worth the trek. If you are taking a scooter there alone, be sure to get back on the road before sunset because the roads are narrow, curvy, sandy in parts, with many potholes - be extremely cautious! Lots of cool spots to take snaps and the extra 20idr to go up the lookout pts are totally worth it and helps the local community. Highly advise spending a whole afternoon here so you can make your way up and down to the secluded beach at the bottom - absolutely magnificent!! "
tbrunt,"Allen, TX",May 2018,Worth going to but got busy with the tourists even during shoulder season! Obviously attracting more folks now with the Instagram fame of the shoreline. Some folks were hiking down to the beach but the sea was too rough to get into once down there. 
Mariel D,"Macau, China",Jun 2018,"I‚Äôm just going to tell you this: THE WAY TO GET ANYWHERE IN NUSA PENIDA IS HELL! I‚Äôm not talking about the views or the beach, i‚Äôm talking about the road to get there. It‚Äôs really BAD. So yes the place is amazing but the most of the time you are in your car or your moto to get any of the places in the island (at least 45 min to get from one point to another) so when you arrived you will probably feel pretty bad. I went yesterday with my husband and my 2 year old daughter and we are all in pain...my neck, my arms even 1 foot is hurt because all the horrible movements in the car because of the rocks in the way. "
Giacomo,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",May 2018,This place is  must go in Nusa Penida. Such amazing drone shots and scenic photos can be taken there. The only problem is the amount of people who all want to take the same picture. There are little places to have something to eat and drink and for the more adventurous you can follow the steep steps that take you to the main beach on the ground. I had vertigo so couldn‚Äôt do it but again.... wow! 
Marcusnyi,"Mandalay, Myanmar",Apr 2018,"It is not only good for a breath taking view but for an adventure.it can be said a kind of adventure.only if we are fit enough,we will get the full satisfaction offered by the place. Most people enjoy having their photos taken as there is no place like this we can get our bestie"
m_baxby,7 contributions,Jun 2018,"This is one place where photos don‚Äôt do the place justice. The view from the top is incredible. The climb down to the beach was tougher than expected (probably tougher going down than coming back up, as you can use the fencing to pull yourself up the steps). The beach has the most perfect soft white sand, and the waves are breathtaking - not safe for swimming, but great to watch! An amazing place."
Travel4Life1112,51 contributions,May 2018,"This is a must see in Nusa Penida. I think it is worth the trip just to see this.I did the stairs down to the bottom to the beach, its quite a trek. You really need to wear shoes and be in good shape and not scared of heights. It takes about 45 minutes down and a bit longer up. It is supposed to be ""stairs"" but as you go further down it becomes more like climbing. I strongly recommend making the climb super worth it once you get to the bottom. It is very hot and you are in the beating open sun so drink water and maybe and hat or sunscreen."
Luke B,12 contributions,May 2018,One of the most amazing coastlines you can witness. The views are amazing as far as the eyses can see. The colours of the water and the sands against the towering cliff faces is breathtaking. One of the many spectacular views on the paradise Island. Careful of the photo snapping tourists near the cliffs edge. Can get very busy.
ymLee1991,Malaysia,May 2018,It's a long way down climbing to the bottom to reach the beach. Stairs made of rocky woods and stones. Blue ocean and white sandy beach. Definitely worth the 30mins climb down and probably an hour to climb up. Preferably to reach around 4-5pm when it isn't so hot and can enjoy the sunset
alam n,4 contributions,Dec 2017,"Just like a pinkie promise, the land does also appear to take the form of a Kelingking or pinkie finger. However, it is the comparison to the T-Rex that has caused this location to become so popular."
Inez S,7 contributions,May 2018,such a wonderful beauty from above. i was scared to go down at first because it looked really hard. it was pretty steep but i kept goingjust one step at a time. but because it's really steep it is also really fast to get down/up. the beach was worth it. also i recommend going up when the sun is not too hot so you're not as tired.
coolsabharwals,"Mumbai, India",May 2018,extremely bad road... just do kellingking beach on nusa penida and nothing else.. bad infrastructure
Beauy,"Two Rocks, Australia",May 2018,"The beach here is immaculate ! One of the best swims in Bali , there is a decent walk trail down to the beach where the water is fresh and the white sand is awesome , a must see at Penida üëå"
Brian L,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Apr 2018,"This place cant be described in words. The view is simply stunning and out of this world. If youre fit for the long walk down to the beach I strongly recommend, but be carefull of the strong waves. Not the best roads and a quite a bumpy ride. "
Sebastian S,"Mexico City, Mexico",May 2018,"The beach has a great view from the top but there is a lot of people and, for me, you won't be able to appreciate all the beauty that kelingking has to offer. If you want, and can, you can go down the beach and relax for 1 or 2 hours. It is important to mention that the path is really steep and you have to wear sneakers. I would say that it is no suitable for kids. Once you are in the beach, you can enjoy a privileged view with only a couple of people. "
Revol S,11 contributions,Feb 2018,This was the place I was looking forward since the beginning of the trip. I was amazed by the view this place had to offer. The trek down to the beach was amazing as it had rained just before we reached here so the path as wet and slippery making it more interesting  the water is as blue as it could be and the sand so fine. One of the spot you should miss if you visit NusaPenida island. 
vish 2 travel,"New Delhi, India",Mar 2018,"If you happen to plan Bali , then don't miss to include this place in your itinerary .Hands down , it's going to be the best highlight of your Bali trip , it's actually misspelt .It should have been the 'Killing beach' üòÄWe did it along with billabong & broken bridge , and what a delight it was to do all 3 together .Plan a little before you go . the views are pure and ptistine to say the least but the unbelievable part us at the beach , which will take 30+mins of trekking down .The trek is slightly primitive, to say the least (Google before you make up your mind ) . I saw atleast 2 dozen of people doing it   .You may like to view the splendour of the place from the tip of the cliff itself, no sweats if you can't go down . Connectivity to the place  is poor , if you want to be kind and day that it's non-existing .The way the cliff is arched out it is so very selfie friendly , and there are eating spots, which are just fine and serve some best fresh juice and bananas , you can manage to have here .However , you cannot and should not to this place with kids under 8.Happy Bali to you !"
AliMahisefat,"Tehran, Iran",May 2018,"You must see! It‚Äôs  sooo dreamy!!clear ocean with magnatic colors! Unbelievable! There were 3 beaches in our tour which were all so beautiful. But among all, Kelingking is the best! For the next time, I will definitely choose Kelingking to stay the whole day. Because of islans‚Äôs gravel roads, you will be moved to left and right strongly which might makes you sick and vomiting. Make sure to bring a big beach towel and beach tent because the chairs and tents get occupied quickly. Also water shoes are so useful since there are so many shells on coast."
Miekekarregat,"Volendam, The Netherlands",May 2018,"Gotta love love love this view. Very much worth the bumpy ride (when your not a hero on a scooter, hire a car with driver). Don‚Äôt expect to be here by yourself but enough space to make good pics.Few people climb down to the beach so for pics without other people in it just go a couple of meters down. The way to the beach is a challenge, expect more than half an hour walking very steep and sometimes challenging paths. Bring enough water!There are several warungs at the place so a combination with lunch is possible. "
Jesper C,"Kempten, Germany",May 2018,"We went down the steps to the beach, it‚Äôs a steep way were your climbing a bit, I was wearing thongs, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend that at all.The way down takes about 45-60 min. It‚Äôs worth it wenn you get to the beach.We went for a swim at the beach, but it‚Äôs not for everyone, really strong current and big waves.Really a shame that people throw there plastic bottles on the track just because there aren‚Äôt a rubbish bin. We collected minimum 20 water bottles and toke them to the bin at the top."
Stefano Bz,"Bressanone, Italy",May 2018,"If you are in Nusa Penida you have to go and see this amazing place. It is even better as the thousand pictures that you can see! We didn‚Äôt walk down to the beach as we planed to see Billabong and Brocken beach after and did not have enough time, but it has to be beautiful down there!! "
didisand,"Sofia, Bulgaria",May 2018,"If you come to Nusa Penida you cannot skip Kelinking beach since it is one of the biggest sightseeings on the island. The road has parts that were okay but some of them were very bumpy, with a lot of holes in them and the last 10 minutes are all sand and stones with holes. My boyfriend and I were traveling with a rented motorcycle and this was the 5th day of us driving (never had before) and we managed just fine but keep in mind that it is nit easy at all. You can hire a local driver but the experience is not the same at all. The view point on the cliff is overcrowded with a lot of tourists. You wait in line to make photos. The views are breathtaking though, you have to see them live (just what you would put as a desktop wallpaper)! If you are hungry, you can visit one of the warungs (local restaurants) there. The parking fee is 5 000 Rp/motorbike. There is a steep path down the beach but if you plan to go there go as early as you can since the road is long and the path to the beach is hard and with no shadow. Don‚Äôt recommend to watch the sunset here - the road as I said is in very bad condition and dangerous in the day not to say at night."
Smad2306,"Newport, UK",May 2018,"Beautiful beach, and views especially sunset, there is a hike down to the beach but be careful it's quite dangerous. Not for little ones"
Cameron M,"Mobile, AL",Apr 2018,"Overall, it is a pain in the butt for a modest pay-off. The infrastructure on Nusa Penida is over-run with tourists. 8 of 10 vehicles that are beating the roads into a bombed-out wasteland are tourist vans, vying to keep two wheels on the pavement and hopefully two wheels on the shoulder. The convoy often comes to a stop and even backs up to create a little room for an oncoming convoy of tourist vans. Much of the road to Kelingking Broken is completely destroyed by tourist van traffic, leaving the locals in a horrible position. The vies is spectacular, but it's barely worth the nausea-inducing kidney-battering ride to get there. The scenery along the way is only a modest consolation for the tough ride because there‚Äôs so much garbage. Garbage EVERYWHERE. The token trash bins overflow and the wind scatters what little rubbish that folks bother to try to dispose of. The rainy season had passed, so at least the trash you see in the ravines will stay put until the end of the year."
asdarunasd,"Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India",May 2018,"This place has recently been scrolling in social media and yes it is worth the visit just for the view. Its located in nusa penida which is 40 min boat ride from the main coast of bali. Nusa penida is a small island with very small roads and i would recommend to book with a tour guide if you dont know much about the place. If you are an adventure seeker you can rent out a motorbike and explore the island urself. One of the best view is the view from top of Kelingking beach, you can also hike down the cliff where you can experience the white sandy beach ( hiking up will be hardwork). Over all worth a visit"
jennyKincumber,kincumber,Apr 2018,It is a beautiful view from the top. But it is a long way down to the beach. The path is steep and dangerous so didn't do it.
lemsu,"Istanbul, Turkey",May 2018,"We went to Nusa Penida island by ferry approximately in  1 hour, when we reached the island tour guide pick up us and we went kelingking beach in 45 minutes ,the roads are so bad but when you see the perfect view you can forget all suffers. We liked this place very much. If you come to Bali you should visit this place one time in your life "
tuyet n,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Apr 2018,Beautiful Keling Beach. Should go down the the stair if you have time. This is lunch stop for most of the tour.
nFatrin,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"it was really beautiful here. The view from the TOP is amazing !!!!To go down there is crazy path but possible. It was really amazing experienceTiring, hot but fun !! Such a workout in the middle of hot day. Beach down there is clean and beautiful.I admire so much those local ladies who go down there to sell drink. Unbelieveable. They made it like it's an easy thing to do. If u re adventurous enough go for it. "
Elia S,11 contributions,Apr 2018,"Spectacular view, creamy sandy beach and turqoise water. Trip to go there is preferred in early morning the road partly challenging.nice place for instagram pics."
Violeta Z,"Monterrey, Mexico",Apr 2018,"From the port you can rent a motorbike for 70 rupias and bike to all the attractions in the island. I did not how to use a scooter, this day I learned. It was super fun saves a lot of money. The road has a lot of holes but if you drive cautiously you will get there. A lot of different photospots "
emmy91,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,We took a half day tour across the island in Nusa Penida to visit these places and this was the last stop.. If you‚Äôre lucky you get to spot dolphins too! 
Warung NG,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Apr 2018,Wanna be here all the times. Amazing view and the atmosphere here just truly fantastic. The beach also clean.
Roy,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"Very nice place, the beach, clift and its wave make me think about going there again. Easy to find drink and food there, since there are many stall around‚ù§Ô∏è"
Ranjit Laxman,"Thalassery, India",Apr 2018,Many people had visited Bali earlier with whom I checked before going to Bali. But none of them mentioned anything about this place. Nusa Penida is an island just 45 mins by a speed boat from Sanur harbour. If you book through an agent they will arrange everything and there is a driver at the island waiting for you by the time the boat reaches the island. Kelingking Beach is an hours drive and the crowd is just catching up now. This breathtaking view is unexplainable. One has to experience it as when you stand at that cliff which is a bit dangerous as there is no safety rails except a bamboo fencing that too not very safe. carry your camera always when you go to such places and there are lots of photo ops. There is a way you can climb down but again too risky and dangerous.
rseanh,"Cardiff, UK",Apr 2018,"Most beautiful sight I have ever set my eyes on, it‚Äôs a must do! Walking down to the beach on the other hand is a massive job, so tiring and physical! You have to watch every step, take plenty of food and water! The beach itself is great, but waves are unbelievable strong so be careful. "
Rios-Little,"Dakar, Senegal",Mar 2018,This is a must place to visit if you are in Nusa Penida. The view is spectacular. We all kids and adults enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend you add to your list. We went in the middle of the day and so it was terribly hot. It's probably better to go for sunrise or sunset. 
Ilaria C,"London, UK",Apr 2018,this place is absolutely amazing! there are sone dangerous stairs which bring you down to the beach but the view is great even from the top of the hill. they suggest you not go downstairs but people told me that it‚Äôs a great experience. We couldn‚Äôt go because it was late and it was getting dark. Sunset is spectacular from there. The road to get there is a disaster so be careful and take your time. It‚Äôs worth to go though! 
rishi b,122 contributions,Apr 2018,"To reach the top of the hill from where you can see the Kelingking beach, you have to rent a scooter and ride 14 kms / 30-45 mins. The view from top is completely worth the effort. Also, while you are at Nusa Penida, you should check out Billabong Beach."
SteMar247,"Maidstone, UK",Apr 2018,"This island has many impressive views and this is one of them. I would have loved to have had time to go down to the beach and explore, but our itinerary wouldn't allow that. "
rohit p,"Chandigarh, India",Dec 2017,"The view from is top is just spectecular, although you have to walk down to go to the beach which should take around half and hour and it's not very safe either as the board reads ""go down at your own risk"" as the path down the hill was a bit broken when we went there"
Nicolai B,"Altdorf bei Nurnberg, Germany",Apr 2018,What a view!! It is amazing. If you want you can go done stairs. It takes maybe 40 minutes to go done and spend some time at this nice white sand beach. I will come back!! Must have seen at Nusa Penida 
luxurybackpacking,"London, UK",Mar 2018,Honestly pictures of Kelingking Beach do not do it justice! No matter how many times you visit it still is incredible! Make sure to head there in the afternoon when crowds are a lot quieter and much  of the tour groups have gone.
TheLittleTraveller,"Chania Town, Greece",Apr 2018,Don't leave the island without see that beautiful beach.Its really dangerous to get down there and some parts are like climbing but if u stay up without go down is beautiful again!! U can go after the angel beach it's 20 min from there .the road is pretty bad and if you don't know how to drive good a scooter then find a driver to drive you there with a car.when you return there is a shortcut road 40' that is good .If you want to go only to that beach you have to drive from that road 
Mario B,48 contributions,Apr 2018,From the top (starting point) is probably best view point on island! There are lot of small cottages with food & drinks at the top so you can buy what you need. Bring enought water because climbing down & up cam be heawy for unprepared persons. Recomend snickers and not fliplops (despite you can see lot turists walking with them:). At the bottom one of the beast beaches I ever saw! Don't swim far - dangerous waves! Don't missed this place when you are in Nusa Penida!
Traveller123,"London, UK",Feb 2018,"My self and a friend traveled to this spot by motorbike which we rented at the port for around $5 AUD. The roads are in terrible conditions at some points so I wouldn't recommend going this way unless you experienced riding. We reached Kelingking took a couple photos and without hesitation made our way down towards the beach. Let's just say going down was the easy part, The mountain is extremely steep with only some bamboo tied together with some rope to 'stop' you from falling off the edge. It is also extremely hot so take a lot of water, but don't pack too much as the climb back up the mountain can become extremely difficult if you have a lot to carry. Once you do get down to the bottom you can not enter the water, as it is dangerously rough, the waves are huge and crash right on the shore with that much power that even standing meters away you are almost swept off your feet. We were also lucky enough to be able to purchase some water and beers down the bottom as well. We made the silly mistake of drinking a beer before the climb back up which we both regretted as the climb is so hard and with a beer in your belly you do not feel good. The climb back up was exhausting, and we almost passed out from the heat a couple of times because there is absolutely no relief from the sun and we started the climb back up at 12:30 - 1:00 pm. I wouldn't say I am unfit but we both really struggled. We timed the climb up and it took us about 30 mins - although it felt a lot longer!All in all - its an experience like none other! Would I do it again HELL NO. But I would tell anyone who is up for it to give it a go! My body ached for the next 3 days."
A Raz,"Birmingham, UK",Apr 2018,"I've been to Bali numerous times and visited many of its beaches but Kelingking Beach is particularly outstanding. The view from the cliff is just amazing and (if you're fit enough to descend to the beach and climb back up) the beach itself is very rewarding. Yes! It's quite an effort to go down to the beach, but that what makes it worth the effort. The sand, the wave, everything is so perfect.If you wanna go down to the beach, my recommendation is to go there early in the morning. Travel light. Going down to the beach is quite dangerous.. use practical and comfortable sandals. While down there.. just enjoy the beach for a couple of hours.. You could also bring bento to have lunch down there. After you gain back your energy then climb back up. Climbing back up is actually a lot easier than going down, but it takes more energy.This place is very recommended and I would defly go back there again!PS: It takes around 20-40 minutes to descend and 10-20 minutes to climb up, depending on your level of fitness."
Andresguia,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"The place is beautiful but to reach the white sandy beach below you must descend dangerous steps. The typical photo here is sitting on the edge of the cliff, be careful! There is a tree called the tree of love nearby where people used to make photos too."
Wei92,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,"The view here is very beautiful and nice. My girlfriend and I enjoyed ourselves very much, especially with the stunning view. Will definitely recommend anyone visiting Bali to pay a visit to Nusa Penida and Kelingking Beach"
Denisa S,"Prague, Czech Republic",Apr 2018,"Definitely the must see of Nusa Penida...Very beautiful view.. Even it‚Äôs not easy to get down to the beach, offers a white sand and clear water. "
JubastiOnTour,"Munich, Germany",Apr 2018,"Kelingking beach is beautiful and offers an amazing view and is definitely the must-see of Nusa Penida. However, while the streets are better than many other streets on Nusa Penida, the place is still hard to reach by scooter and not recommended for beginners. The entrance was 5k per scooter. As in most cases, you have to share this beautiful place with lots of tourists, especially selfie-addicted instagrammers looking for the perfect picture (at least in the afternoon at around 3pm). Still, we would definitely visit this place again to enjoy the view!"
Stella Marie A,15 contributions,Mar 2018,"The view is really awesome! It could be seen from above that the beach is crystal and inviting. However, at past half a century old, going to the beach and trekking for about an hour (and a half) will literally take my breath away.Going around the island of Nusa Penida requires a good pair of comfortable shoes, preferably hiking ones.  The rolling hills however small would not make comfortable trekking in slippers.  Food was available although the choices were not varied.  Remember to hydrate yourself, sun could be harsh up there on the hills. Also, apply and re-apply sunblock."
janiblank,"Aachen, Germany",Mar 2018,"The view and the nature at Kelinging are absolutely amazing but the place is pretty crowded and everyone tries to take the best photos, selfies and drone shots which is pretty annoying.."
KHigson,"Leyland, UK",Dec 2017,"Arrived here via moped on the horrendous roads but worth every massive bump along the way. Spectacular views the rock formation, which looks like a dinosaurs head. The sea is clear blue, with white sands. There are various spots you can view it from and have your photo taken. On a personal note I suffer badly from a fear of heights so unlike most wasn't keen on getting too close to the edge due to the very steep drop. There are 'steps' made from bamboo and tree roots that lead down the steep ascent to the beach but there is a sign suggesting it is dangerous so not to go down. I certainly wouldn't attempt this in flipflops or if like me you have a fear of heights. I tried to go a short way down (after some encouragement) for a photo but couldn't make it as I was too worked up but many others found it fine to reach the photo point. I only saw 1-2 people who went all the way down to the beach. It looks amazing but not for the faint hearted by any means.There are a few shops and restaurants around at teh top which are nice to sit in and enjoy the view. Stunning location, a definate for instergrammers, but just have your wits about you."
ilikemanggis,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"One of my bucket list was done and checked after visited this beautiful beach. White sands mix with deep blue and turquoise water definitely a perfect combination. When you visit Nusa Penida, please don't forget to visit this beautiful spot!"
PearlySim,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"A lovely seascape and awesomely breathtaking place to take photos to post onto your instagram.  If not on a guided tour, try taking the very steep stairs down to the beach (at your own risk)."
Adham411,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2018,make sure you have enough time to go down and up againswimming there is something you don't want to miss
Brian L,"Chandler, AZ",Mar 2018,"Kelingking Beach looks great in pictures and that is what brings people to see it.HOWEVER!You have to take a ferry from Sanur to Nusa Penida.  Then from the pier you need to take a 1 hour car ride over some of the worst roads imaginable.Once you arrive, you want to start taking pictures but to get really great pictures you MUST take the trail.  The trail has rocky, slippery, steps, broken bamboo for hand rails, and it is extremely steep.  There are about 7 - 8 warning signs stating you are on your own.I stopped half way to take my pictures while my friend went all the way down to the beach.  She mentioned it is very treacherous getting to the beach as the steps are now in the mountainside.Keep in mind this is just going down and now you have to return the same way back up.If you really want to do this be in great shape and don‚Äôt plan anything the following day as you will be sore. "
karinkaspar,24 contributions,Mar 2018,"Very popular place in Nusa Penida, so thing about timing. We went there early in the morning (around seven), so we‚Äôve been there almost alone, just us and another couple.At the beginning you see a sign: ‚ÄúDo not go down on the beach. Road is broken.‚Äù Well, we went there anyway, is quite easy, if you have not a flipflop shoes. You have to be careful, of course, but then... it is just amazing. Big waves, so do not sed√≠m far away, strong klima. And thing about timing for a way back as well; we‚Äôve been there quite a long time, so on the road back was quite busy climbing and more important - with very strong sun. Early in the morning it us the best, not just because of you are alone there, but also because of more comfortable way back without strong sun. "
Venkat,Singapore,Mar 2018,"The view from the top of the mountain was breathtaking, it‚Äôs dangerous to go down to the beach, the path to beach was not maintained."
Mandy K,30 contributions,Mar 2018,"Terrible roads to get there but the views are absolutely amazing. Worth the effort though. I climbed down to the beach. Don't try unless you are fit and strong. Very dangerous, slippery, steep and unstable bamboo rails but it was one of the best things I have ever done. When I went there were no waves so swimming was beautiful in crystal clear blue water. Sand beautiful and white. Water, soft drink and Bintang available at the beach. Many tourists at the top viewpoint but only five on the beach. Manta rays were able to be seen from the top view points. Incredible place to visit. "
melanieamelia2,"Trier, Germany",Mar 2018,"The true landscape is awesome. Complete facilities from toilets to snack canteens. My suggestion to try to go down, it would be a wonderful experience on your journey, because not all who want to go down. A must visit this place."
Bradley C,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"A must visit point. However, there are two many tourists nowadays. Didn't get the chance to go down the beach but heard it's pretty nice(also tough to get down though) but would like to give it a try next time."
Uphiet K,"Pasuruan, Indonesia",May 2017,"Bumpy roads but worthy reward. I'm in love with this place, so beautiful. Hidden place and still not so crowded. If you go to Bali, go to Nusa Penida to get calmer and peaceful place like this one"
luislellis,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Mar 2018,"What a view!!! This beach is so beautiful, the landscape is gorgeous. To reach the beach you have to go down from a stair. Kind of slippery but ok to go. Worth it."
Voguely Vivien,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,"Worth the (rather rocky) journey to Kelingking Beach. Apparently it will take years before they can upgrade the gravel roads to tar ones. While it is possible to rent mopeds to get around simply anywhere in Nusa Penida, personally I won't recommend them! I've seen tourists trying to manoeuvre their way along these uneven roads and it is cringe-worthy. I suggest either renting vehicles with driver (500k+ for one day) or ojek aka moped riders (70k for one day) to show you around. I did both and the latter was quite an experience! Can't feel my thighs after the 1 hour ride along bumpy, gravel roads to Atuh Beach hahaha"
Jason E,165 contributions,Feb 2018,"It‚Äôs one of the most beautiful vista in the Bali and the Nusa islands but 99% of you will only look at it from up top of the cliff.  It takes a long time to get there and the path down was congested and full of other tourists.   With that being said, it makes for some of the best highlights when we show people our trip.  In a nut shell, it‚Äôs beyond beautiful but it didn‚Äôt make me emotionally attached to an experience there. "
Rafaella Pessoa,"Sao Paulo, SP",Feb 2018,The view from the top is just amazing. You can do a trail to access the beach. That trial is quite hard and takes around one hour. You can do it on flip flops but it might be way easier on tennis. The beach is not the best for swimming as there are many waves but the views along the way and the blue water compensate the effort to get there!
Izani A,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"It's worth to come and enjoy the view here. but if you manage to be here by grouping, 4 pax is just nice for 7 seaters car, so just rent a car with driver rather than ride motorcycle, since the 8KM road from jetty to the kelingking's beach is not well maintained."
Rohliana L,19 contributions,Feb 2018,"Nusa Penida should be on your list when you are traveling to bali, if this is your first time and you are traveling alone better book a group tour the price is worth it. They offer many package. You can choose with snorkeling package or just to see the west of nusa penida such a kelingking beach broken beach and angel billabong."
RaghavAhuja,"Bengaluru, India",Mar 2018,One of the best places on our Bali trip was this. This has an amazing view of the beach down below. Try going down if it‚Äôs possible. It‚Äôs a must see place
Feinspitz,"Vienna, Austria",Mar 2018,So the view really is amazing. It is definitely worth renting a scooter (around 3$ a day) and driving there. The road is not always perfect but the way is managable even for more unexperienced drivers (like my self; 2nd time ever on a scooter)The Beach? Totally different story. The way down is difficult (some may say quite dangerous) the way up is straight up a full workout. I have never been sweatier before I think. What you get when you do this to yourself is a dirty beach tons of jellyfish on the Beach and in the water and local People trying to sell you snacks and water which you will eventually actualy need.I would Not recommend you to Go down when your are Not in a good shape or if you expect the beach of your dreams.
MasMarjana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"I have been in so many place in Bali, and in my opinion this is the best spot. The view from the top was simply breathtaking. But I didn‚Äôt want to walk down due to safety consideration and time consume. People called Kelingking Beach it‚Äôs mean Little Finger or Pinkie Beach. But in my opinion the cliffs isn‚Äôt like little finger but look like Tyrannosaurus Rex.Kelingking Beach was a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island.The road to reach this place was unfavourable. Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most"
Amy T,"Brooklyn, NY",Mar 2018,"I had been wanting to visit Nusa Penida after seeing the beautiful pictures everywhere and realizing it was just 30 minutes from Bali where I was going on vacation this past week. The reviews are accurate - this isn't an easy place to get to, and the climb is not easy either - but the view is worth it. I have never seen a place like this in my life and it IS breathtaking. We booked a tour which included a fast boat from Sanur beach to Nusa Penida and then a driver picked us up and drove us there. We could have rented motorbikes or just a taxi, but we weren't sure and were limited on time so we just got a tour guide. The fast boat was about 45 minutes, and once we arrived our tour guide immediately picked us up and started driving up Nusa Penida to the beach, which was about a 45 minute drive through long, winding, and needless to say bumpy roads. Once we arrived the views were incredible and it wasn't too touristy which was great. We decided to start the trek down, and about halfway we stopped to turn back around. To be completely honest, my legs still hurt 3 days later from the hike (and I didn't even go all the way). The hike down is not paved and has rocks and some wood to help guide you, but it's definitely scary and treacherous. I do regret not going all the way down, so if you have time - I would recommend trying it if you are fit and in shape. For me, it was about 90 degrees and I was absolutely exhausted, so I was scared about going all the way down and turned around even though I wish I hadn't. I would visit this place as a once in a lifetime experience if you are in Bali. "
Sari I,16 contributions,Feb 2018,"It‚Äôs the most beautiful nature I‚Äôve seen so far in Bali , it‚Äôs hard to get too the place , but totally worth it ! "
RuddyDusk,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2018,This is the 3rd time i went down to the beach and it always worth it every drop of my sweat. Amazing view.
Cha,Philippines,Dec 2017,"Simply wow! I wish I could swim in those cool, blue waters. Fresh wind and white sand. I absolutely loved it!"
Ingrid F,7 contributions,Feb 2018,Wow this beach was incredible but the hike back up was mental! Worth it once in a lifetime but not sure I'd do it again!
Abie,"Queensland, Australia",Sep 2017,The most beautiful spot in Nusa Penida i reckon. So majestic and breathtaking to view! Getting a photo taken at the spot without the fence here though looks a bit dangerous and is a bit of a joke as you had to fall in line as if going to the toilet. The path down the ravine to the beach was closed when we went there and did not look at all safe but a fair few were willing to risk it for instagram. HahaThe place was a bit of a drive but relatively easy to get to with a map and a few directions from locals. Going back was confusing on a motorbike.We got to sample the local mie goreng as well which was surpringly offered at a very affordable price compared to the rest of the tourist spots and Bali. Lovely experience. Will definitely go back!
Ayush Krishnan C,19 contributions,Dec 2017,"This - in my opinion - is the epitome of beauty in Bali. The view is absolutely stunning. Although we didn't have time, I would have liked to trek all the way down to the bottom beach. If you do, I would highly recommend. This is a must visit in Bali - add it straight away to your itinerary."
Aashish T,3 contributions,Jan 2018,Blue water and golden sands - that summarizes it all. Such a calm and beautiful place! Thanks to #BaliCheapestTour for making my trip hasslefree and simple.
Konstantinus_Bayu,20 contributions,Jan 2018,"Kelingking beach is one of the must visit spot when you are at Nusa Penida. Located at the south side of the island, it will take around 1,5 hours from the Toya Pakeh harbor due to damaged road conditions in some areas to the location.But all the suffering on the journey will be paid once you arrive at the Kelingking Beach. Emerald colored ocean, white sandy beach and cool breeze will welcome you there."
Nina N,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Feb 2018,"We did not realise how strenuous the hike down to the beach is, the way down is quite tough going with just bamboo tied together on either side to stop you from falling, I was still a bit sick with the flu at the time and only made it down to the halfway point before becoming dizzy. The climb up was even more hard going and we passed a couple of people on the way up taking a break and dying of thirst that asked us for some water, I would definitely recommend not going in the afternoon, we went at about 3pm and the sun beats down on the walk with no escape from it which made it hard going and I became extremely sunburnt from the hike. I definitely want to come back and try the hike again with a bit more preparation next time."
Ika C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,I wasn‚Äôt aware that the road was really bad on the west side of Nusa Penida island. Our car was shaken hard to reach Kelingking beach. Using motor cycle was not recommended . 
Irwan2003,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,Great view.... But to reach the beach you must down with the very long stairs... But it's worthed... You will found the great beach with great sand
thb68boy,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"When we arrived on this beach, I feel so amazing that we have some kind of beach like this. One of the things from the myth there is that they have a love tree and while you climb and sit there, your love wish will come true, although I don't believe it but some friends climbed and took a photo too hehe. Too bad that we cannot swim on this beautiful beach because of the high tide, but still you can enjoy the beach."
Prathamesh Sawant,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2018,"The view is simply breathtaking. This place was never a part of my itinerary, but I met a Malaysian dude during white water rafting and he showed me some of the pics from the island. Then and there I decided i'll visit this place.The T-Rex shaped mountain, blue azure waters everything is just simply amazing. If one is willing to hike a little they can even go down to the sandy beach at this place. However, since we were on a tight schedule we did not go all the way down. Also just 100-200 meters from this place there is another viewpoint which gives you a very different perspective of this place. From that place, the entire mountain feels like an elephant with his trunk and the mountain besides seems like a crocodile."
Tom A,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jan 2018,I lost few times before reach to this beach. Worth few hours bike riding and the view was breathtakingly beautiful! Next time will plan properly to visit and spend a night in the island is a must!
sharealkoh,6 contributions,Jan 2018,This was our last stop and we had to catch the 330pm ferry and it was already 240pm! The drive back was about 40mins. The drive was really bumpy but it's totally worth it! Next trip we're definitely staying and making it down to the beach! 
Devansh A,"Hyderabad, India",Feb 2018,My main tip is I you have time spend a few hours here cause you can hike down to the beach and chill. So better get good shoes and a carry on with swim wear and stuff i saw many broken slippers down and it would be a painful hike up.  It should take atleast an hour to reach down to the beach and the climb up is tough but totally worth it. We only regret not having much time to enjoy this place we ran down and up again. 
Tanni Williams,Hoedspruit,Jan 2018,"A must visit whilst on this island! Just be weary of the steps leading down to the beach, but what you will find is absolutely worth it... wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing it in flip flops.."
Kopal G,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2018,"The view from the top is amazing, but the climb down the cliff is worth every bit once you see the bluest waters there can be. The last section of the climb is almost vertical and it's better to remove slippers of you're wearing them to have better footing. The sea waves are strong. We did a somersault in the water when we were hit by two back to back waves. Every sand grain is white. And the water is the perfect turquoise blue!! Remember to carry some water down for the climb back up. Also remember to climb down light, without any bag.The climb back up requires one to pull them self up with all four limbs. The beach is virgin. They have made a path to teach the beach using wooden sticks, logs and stones. In places it does get tricky. But it's doable!Would definitely recommend this awesome experience to those who are looking for adventure, fun and excitement! P.s. not for those with a fear of heights."
SaurovNandy,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2017,Kelingking beach is one of the most stunning sights that I have ever seen.We reached there by noon and luckily there were not many tourists.If you have the time then do walk down to the beach from Karang dawa view point. The steps are uneven and the climb can be a bit treacherous but surely you won't regret it.At least climb down till the half way point for your best photo op.
Gabcared,"Suzhou, China",Jan 2018,"Very nice views, beautiful beach. Quite hard to get there, especially in rainy season, but even if you don't go down it worth it."
MorwennaJones,"Cambridge, UK",Jan 2018,"We visited Kelingking in January, the off season and most quiet time of year for tourism, expecting to get there and find it largely empty.  After negotiating the treacherous roads by scooter (and I mean treacherous- we witnessed a bad accident only the day after), we arrived to find about 30/40 other tourists there, which is a lot given the limited amount of cliff space.  Lots had arrived in the people-carriers from resorts, which make it easy to navigate the dangerous roads and get to all of the places on the island that, otherwise, are hard to reach.  The beach is utterly stunning and completely beautiful, but be prepared to find it crowded, especially if you visit in the off-season.  There's also a very dangerous ledge that tourists were dangling off for photos!  Also, when we visited, there was a sign next to the path down to the beach warning against going down.  We ummed and ahhed about whether to risk it, but fortunately chose not to, and after doing another walk down the cliffs, I'm so glad we chose not to!  The cliff trails here are very steep, dangerous and frequently involve putting your whole body weight on bamboo strapped to the cliff, so for god's sake, if there's a sign there saying that the path is broken, don't ignore it!"
Nusa Penida Exploration,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Kelingking beach is top tourist destination in Nusa Penida island. It's a hidden Paradise in the island. It's a famous place to do the activity of the tracking and also well-known as a place to enjoy the wonderful sunset.
niranjan a,12 contributions,Jan 2018,I can only say is this place is a mush visit place. The view is breath taking.You need to book a tour to nusa penida to see this place. Once ur in bali go for some local tour to visit this place.Must visit i would say.
Bagus Perbawa,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Had an amazing visit at Kelingking beach. The weather was pretty hot and the view was quite breathtaking, the waves looks great from above and the turquoise water was visible. Unfortunately I did not wear proper shoes and my slippers was unfit for trrekking down to the beach.Other travellers said the swell was around 1-2 meters high and was not that hard to swim. The secluded beach would have been a perfect spot to just relax, sunbake and dipping but do bring some water when you go down, its quite a hike back up.Additional advice - take some photos at the wooden bamboo boat on top of the hill (it's a bit worn out - be careful) or take some amazing shot in the lonely tree. Food and drinks are quite reasonable, bought Nasi Goreng for 30K and coke (can) for 15K."
756rickyl,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Nusa Penida an island off the southeast coast of Bali. Not many people know about this surprisingly beautiful island that contain so many beautiful, natural spots. Recently, more and more people are starting to discover and explore this wonderful island. There are about a dozen separate locations/spots within the island such as: Angel's Billabong, Pantai Atuh, Crystal Bay, etc, etc ... with the most famous one, arguably, is Pantai Kelingking (Kelingking Beach). Well, for people who have social media and love to post pictures on the net, this island is the definitely the one for you."
leberl,"Denver, CO",Jan 2018,"The view from the top is absolutely incredible! There is a 5,000 IDR entrance fee. You can hike down to the bottom and get to the beach. Be aware the hike is very sketchy in places. You hike along the rim with massive drop offs to either side of you. There are some bamboo fences but they aren't very steady. Wear proper hiking shoes (no flip flops or sandals). I do not recommend going by yourself. The hike down took me about 30 minutes but I hike on a regular basis. If you are able to brave the hike down, you'll be rewarded with an empty or near-empty beach! Keep an eye on the tide and weather as you do not want to get stuck down at the bottom."
Albi A,3 contributions,Oct 2017,"We can say is that this place is magnificent,the sceneries from the top is really spectacular.And hike down to the beach,you can spend a day sunbathing and relaxing in one of the most beautiful and remote beaches I've ever come across."
Ramona N,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2017,"This Instagram famous coastal cliffscape will not disappoint. This is definetely one of those landscapes that make you feel so small! When we reached there we forgot about the awful roads leading here. At times we were just driving over small rocks! Me and my husband took a short trek down but didn‚Äôt venture onto the beach. The path looked a little bit rough and after our crazy drive, we were to tired to do it. I mean reaching the beach I could do that, but then  hike back up: No, thank you!"
Locomotive Hotel & Spa,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"Wooow..!!! no words can described how amazing this place.. the most favorite tourists destination with breathtaking view in this island.. Travelled with friends from Netherland / Suriname and they were soo extremely very excited to see this kind of view..It‚Äôs looks like a dinosaur, they said. Hmm no no.. i said, for me it‚Äôs more looks like the finger of GOD that pointing to Paradise Bali Island üòçüôèüèª"
Going here and there,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"All i can say is that this place is magnificent, the view from the top is to die for. We did manage to descend to the beach from the very very steep stairs, took us around 50 minutes down and 1 hour up. The beach at the bottom is the best beach ever in Bali i would say, the high wave, the blue water and the cliff surrounding will make you forget about the steepest stairs.. definitely recommended to walk down those stair, however if you‚Äôre not very well i wouldn‚Äôt recommend you to go down. :)"
JackRush,"Sheffield, UK",Jan 2018,"A great place to go to view a slice of paradise. If you are able to take the hike down to the beach, you can spend a day sunbathing and relaxing in one of the most beautiful and remote beaches I‚Äôve ever come across.It is possible to stand at the top of the cliff and look down at the beach, or you can scale the cliff yourself to get to it. We are 2 fairly fit 28 year olds and it took us about 25-30 mins to walk down and 20 mins to climb back up. Wear sensible shoes (I went in flip flops and decided it was easier in bare feet!) An absolute must see if you‚Äôre on the island "
Jason S,"Bengaluru, India",Jan 2018,This is the best place we visited in our tour of Nusa Penida - worth every moment we spent here. Though we didn't climb down but the pictures were amazing from top.
worldiscoverer,World,Dec 2017,A drive on bad roads lead to this lovely landscape where you have to jostle with people attempting to get the perfect instagram pictures. Some people trek down to the beach when it is clearly marked not to do so. We met and spoke to a few who really regretted going down and anyway its just another beach down there...we have been to enough around the world not to waste time and effort trekking up and down a risky path.Enjoy the view and don't miss the 'Pohon Cinta' - Love Tree.
beatrixbudhiadi,Bali,Jan 2018,Nusa Penida has so many amazing views making it hard to pick a favorite. But when the cliffs form in the shape of a Tyrannosaurus Rex at Kelingking Secret Point Beach it is bound to be a crowd favorite.Take the boat from SanurIDR75.000 For Local IDR150.000 For ForeignerYou can rent a motorbike at IDR100.000 per day or Hire a driver with car at IDR700.000 per day.You can visit three up to four objects if you want to have one day trip. Have local food to try approximately IDR200.000 for two persons depends on the restaurant and what kind of food you take.
JabbaQld,QLD,Jan 2018,"Attempted the descent, got 3/4 the way down and had a meltdown, so had to abort and ascend back up the mountain. Scary AF and would not recommend unless you are a mountain goat. "
Bel T,"Broome, Australia",Oct 2017,"Definitely worth a visit and also the roads to there are actually quite good and not as bumps as others. We did have a local follow us down to try and make a few dollars off us, but we just ignored him. "
OliverG591,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,One of the highlights of Nusa Penida for sure. The drive there is about 45 min but worth while. Views from top down to the pristine beach are fabulous. We did not make the way down as the treck is quiet adventures and not really safe for kids. That was the only downside...the beach is not really accessible for us. Many little Warungs around for drinks and basic food. 
fabiensf,"Island of Malta, Malta",Nov 2017,"I consider myself to be quite well travelled, and it takes a lot for a beach to impress me, yet i found this spot to be truly breathtaking!  I suggest walking around the cliff to get some different perspectives of the bay."
sthpacificlover,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"After reading the reviews im dumbfounded. Yes its a beautiful little beach - yeah i get that, but seriously there are thousands of better beaches in indonesia, that you dont have to ride for an hour on roads, where some parts are completely washed out then trek 400m down a dangerous cliff on a goat track that has disaster waiting to happen written all over it Ive lived and travelled indonesia for a few years now and was a little dissapointed in this one. Particularly with the large crowds, each paying the 5000rp to park.... the proceeds of which obviously dont go to road or track maintenance"
Novita s,"Sanur, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"View was amazing...weather is so good. Still nature and virgin. Love it.The road need so much repair. If you travel with kids, please becareful, pay a lot of attention to your kids."
Anastasya Gladys,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Im 1000000% sure that NUSA PENIDA is more beautiful than Bali. This island is seriously AMAZING! Every corner of the island is providing u an indescribable view. The air is soooo much different than Bali, its like u get lost in some kind of jungle. I can tell u that this island is going to be the next Bali or even more."
riri273,Indonesia,Dec 2017,"Have no idea what to say when the first time I got here. And when our driver asked us to get down. I do not think that much, I said YES! I have to go down. Can't wait to touch that white-soft-sand. And when I started to went down, that's not as easy as I imagined. The fact is it's hard to get down. And I went down barefoot! since I use the unsuitable sandals. Better you go with sports shoes or mountain slippers. But that's all worth the view! that was so amazing beach I ever visit."
Meg0603,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2017,"Kelingking Beach is amazing. It has been on my bucket list to visit for a while now and the challenging hike down to the beach was well worth it.Most people stayed at the viewing platforms at the top or walked down about 500m to get the beautiful classic shot of the cliffs and water. If you are fit or even just love a challenge I would highly reccomend taking the walk down to the beach, it's an adventure in itself. There are parts of the walk where it is quite steep, almost like rock climbing but they have rocks and bamboo to grab on to and that only accounts for a small portion of the walk.It was a beautiful beach with clear waters. You can swim in the water there (we did) just make sure you know how to swim, there is a bit of a strong undertow and dumpy waves but you can time your entry and exit with the waves.Sadly there is a lot of rubbish that gets washed up on to the beach so if you are planning on making a trip down to the beach I recommend doing your bit and taking a bag of rubbish back up with you rather than just being frustrated with the site."
Grand_Dion,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,This is where he says he's like a dinosaur's head and I can finally come here. The beach is no less good with the places I've visited in Nusa Penida. If you want to get close to the rocks down the stairs are wooden but very dangerous if not careful. Strongly discouraged if not dare better just enjoy this beach from the top course.
Rizki Putra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"If you have time to spend in Bali, please pay a visit to Nusa Penida. This island is just amazingly stunning. It has multiple beaches with jaw-dropping views, totally worth to visit. One of the great options is Kelingking Beach, or the locals used to call it as Karang Dewa. It is only 45 minutes from the Nusa Penida pier by a motorbike. You can easily rent a motorbike, or hire a cab there. Totally easy.The view was completely amazing, as you can see from many pictures here. However, do not go down to the beach if you are not feeling well. It was noon (around 1 am), when I decided to go down to the beach. Actually, the locals put a warning there to not go down because the track was very steep (yeah, 90-degree cliff) it was just like a wall-climbing without any safety rope, and without any safety guards. Going down is totally at your own risk. Also, consider the time to go down and back up. When I went down it was 1 pm and it was extremely hot and even my sunblock couldn‚Äôt prevent me from sunburn. The beach itself was actually very nice, and you can swim and enjoy the view for hours. Don‚Äôt forget to bring drinks and foods because there is no food stall down there. But please, I repeat, please bring back your trash up there. If you could, please also bring some other trash there. Unfortunately, there were so many trash on the beach. It was sad to find those trash in such paradise. Overall, the place is totally worth to visit. Take some pictures, enjoy the sun, smell the breeze, and drink some coconut. If you have enough energy and believe you can go down, please do so and enjoy paradise down there."
piksla,"Los Altos, CA",Dec 2017,"This place is spectacularly beautiful-- one of the prettiest I have ever seen.  They call it T.  Rex beach since it looks like a dinosaur.  The beach itself looks so inviting and tempts one to climb down to the beach.  Beware though- if you aren't in great shape, the hike is super tough.  Not only is the railing fragile and the slope steep, but there aren't ""steps"" most of the way-- just a path.  It is super hot on the path so make sure to wear a hat and bring plenty of water. I felt like I got heat stroke by not doing so.  Both the descent and ascent take a lot of time so budget accordingly."
Anna H,81 contributions,Oct 2017,"What a view! Stunning viewpoint looking down at the beach with the crashing waves and cliffs below. We didn't have time to go down to the beach itself- the track down doesn't look good for those with flip-flops only or a fear of heights! Absolute must-see if staying on Nusa Lembongan or Penida! NB much better road than that to Angel's billabong/broken beach, small entrance fee for parking."
Zhesen Tong,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"I dont think I need to upload any pictures for this beautiful beach; probably this was one of the most beautiful beach I've ever been. Just go checking out yourself. It is definitely worth the trip. Climbing down the cliff was just amazing experience I've ever had; it may look very dangerous, it turns out okay as long as you watch your step and always be careful. Do bring enough water as there're some tourists asked us for water due to dehydration; Water --- very important. Otherwise, enjoy the view along the trek."
yoga p,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"i went with three friends from spain , i went here by two motor bike , when we arived my friends very intrested and than they ask me to go down , oh my god that is very high cliff , i just imagine my self fall down and land on the coral , i must be die . they still ask me to go down , okay i follow you , i was go down very slowly , look at down very scary , the stairs just made from thin wood , around 30 minute i was arived at the beach wow that was nice clearly sand with big wave, amazing but we cant swim there because the wave to wild"
Gayan M,Male,Nov 2017,There is no word if I say experienced the blue virgin beach from the tallest cliff in Asia. ! This is the best place I have sever visit and no word to say it‚Äôs amazing. If you visit to this place there are so many small restaurant you can have a snack and meals too. I came to this place when I was in Nusa Lembongan and this place bit far from Nusa Penida harbor. You must get car or van to visit this place otherwise it‚Äôs difficult for riding motor bikes.i wish I could come this place again and it‚Äôs amazing. 
macasaetchris,"Makati, Philippines",Nov 2017,Good: 1. Stunning view! Must see in Penida!2. Easily accessible - Better roads going here than other tourist spots in Penida.Bad: 1. Can get crowded - So better go here early morning! 2. Commercialized area - Lots of huts selling food and water   
rosafjeldsoe,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Aug 2017,"This was by far the most beautiful beach I have ever been to in my life! It felt more like a green screen in front of me, rather than reality. The sand is perfectly soft. I would recommend taking the trail down to the beach and spend a good hour taking nice photos. The hike looks a bit unsafe but it is pretty sturdy, just wear appropriate trainers (do not go bear foot or wear flip flips), it only takes about 30 minutes down and 20 minutes back up (and avoid going when there is heavy rain, because if you slip on this hike you're as good as dead). The place has become super popular on social media and tourists are quickly starting to know where this secret gem is. At the top of the trail, there are a lot of tourists (with they annoying selfie sticks) blocking the whole view and they will not move for you to get a good photo, so I suggest ignore this area and make it down to the beach like the proper travellers. Also be thoughtful not to throw rubbish into this beautiful nature as Indonesia seems to be very careless with their trash, just be thoughtful and throw your trash into a bin."
Nick G,180 contributions,Sep 2017,"Definitely the number one! Not a lot of things look better in real life than on picture, this one is A LOT better seeing it with your own eyes.Make sure to take the trip down to the beach. It's part of the experience!"

Ethel F,141 contributions,Nov 2017,"I'm stunned! One of the best views I've seen in my life. Though going down will challenge you, it will be worth it. Just wear comfortable shoes since it's so steep.I don't care about my sunburn! Just go there and enjoy. üòâ"
elliot197,Indonesia,Oct 2017,"We went to Nusa Penida for two days, and we had visited this place, really nice view with some rocks around, good place to visit when you're on this island."
AdrianaM,"Castletown, UK",Nov 2017,"View there was breathtaking... there is lots of places where you can buy drinks, even food. You can walk down to the beach but you have to be fit, it‚Äôs not easy and you have to take trainers with you as well as water. You can‚Äôt swim though as water is rough. "
innenurul,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Kelingking Beach is one of the most beautiful beach in Nusa Penida. The view is soo amazing.. From above we can see the blue sea and the famous part of the Island. The best part is crystal sandy beach down below where you can float on the clear sea water. To go down requires more effort and longer time. And its is impossible if you are going with a half day private tour. Another beautiful spot is at the ""neck"" of the island. Taking photo from above is also a bit scary.. But worth doing it..;) This is the best part of Nusa Penida Island."
junodj,"Salatiga, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Like another famous beach in nusa penida, u need an extra effort to reach this place. When i visited last week, the fence was broken so we can not go down to the beach, even some tourists (especially foreigners) still try to stepped down. It‚Äôs very dangerous.But u can still enjoy the best panoramic of Kelingking beach from above. Some people also name it T-Rex bay, because the shape of cliff is look like T-Rex head :D"
Susanti H,"Jambi, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"This is the most beautiful place i have ever visited. The scenery is so amazing. This place is very soothing. On the way, I did not expect the beauty of this scene to be extraordinary, really paid off. And I think in my travels, this place is a place that makes me want to linger enjoy its beauty. I wish i could stay there."
Stanzin G,"Leh, India",Nov 2017,"Kelingking beach is one of the best thing in nusa penida.. it's takes your breath away by seeing the view from the top.. but if you want to enjoy the beach , you have to be ready for the steep foot path which leads all the down to the beach.. must visit place.."
Irma M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"I didn't know that the other side of Bali has this stunning view! It was all started with my boredom of how crowded, loud and slam-bang Bali is! I was always wanted to visit Nusa Penida and it did not disappoint!Kelingking beach was my first destination because of its famous T-rex-shaped cliff. The view from the cliff was breathtaking, I was speechless! Climbing down to enjoy the secluded beach was one of my greatest experience! However, the trail is a bit scary. So, if you guys want to climb down, please wear a good/appropriate pair of shoes. No sandals of flipflops! And be careful!"
Adi S,10 contributions,Oct 2017,Wanna know what paradise looks like . This is what u need to quench ur lust for best shade of blue coloured ocean contrasting with cliffs in green . And a beautiful beach but you have to be cautious on ur way down . But once u reach there u can have the entire beach to urself as the trail is really difficult and hardly few people attempt going down there 
Kayelene P,25 contributions,Oct 2017,"What an experience! I knew i had to go down that beach the moment I saw the photos online. Unfortunately, Im not into hiking and most specially rock climbing!!!But ok, for the love of the beach I thought, maybe it's not as bad as it looks like. WRONG. It's totally dangerous and very very risky! Going down was already a big challenge but rock climbing w/out any harness and only bamboo poles to hold onto while balancing yourself up??i know right..It's definitely a ONCE in a lifetime experience, coz i have no plans of doing that ever again hahahaüòÇPS:The waves there are actually scary strong and high it's almost impossible to swim anyway LOL¬†so pls think a hundred times carefully before going down!"
SunnyFilm,"Helsinki, Finland",Oct 2017,"One of the prettiest places in Bali, I agree, but try to settle for the views from the cliff. The climb down was one of the scariest things I've done. Daredevils should at least bring a good pair of shoes, flipflops were a mistake. "
Wahyu A,1 contribution,Oct 2017,One of the most beautifull place i've ever seen. Unless access to go there isn't good. But i rate 5stars for this place üáÆüá©ü§ò
apatasaurus,"Kiama, Australia",Sep 2017,Fantastic views and the best photos ever!  This was a great place to take in the spectacular scenery. 
Joanna P,5 contributions,Oct 2017,"Title says everything. The whole island is mesmerizing, very few tourists, please clean up your after yourself and let it be forever beautiful :) ..."
Iswanto A,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"This is the most beautiful place I've visited in Bali. Try hike down to the beach, it's quite challenging but worth it. Be careful of the waves though."
Corn,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2017,My thought went straight for the movie The beach. You will have to risk your life to climb down to the beach though. 
Fauzi Prawira,"Berau, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Great view from top of Kelingking Beach, and also beach view so beautifull and enjoy to chill. seen gradation blue water of sea."
snowflower227,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Aug 2017,"This is the most beautiful and the most dangerous beach I've ever seen in my life. The road to go there isn't in good condition but once you arrive, you won't regret. It takes around 10 mins to go down and 10 more mins to climb up, when you are at the beach, you'll feel like you escape from the real life, very soft and white sand, but the waves are so strong that you have to be careful, but chasing and running away from the waves is kind of great experience."
Jadorha,Malta,Sep 2017,You can not go to Nusa penida and not visit this amazing place. Breath thanking views you can also go a very long way down to the beach there is a quite uneasy stairs way down which is not too bad .. way up another story but if in shape enough it is totally worth it 
evanz91,"London, UK",Oct 2017,"From the viewpoint at the top of the cliffs you look down at what can only be described as a paradise beach. Be aware, the moped ride here can be dangerous! The roads/dirt tracks are not maintained and it can be very easy to fall. Also if you plan on walking along the path for a closer look you will defiantly need some trainers.  "
Nguyen080,"Ha Giang, Vietnam",Oct 2017,"Truly beautiful beach with awesome views of the cliffs of the hills and white sand beach. Maybe just need to struggle to get to this place, because road in Nusa penida not too good. But it is very compulsory to come here if travel in the Nusa Penida island."
Diaz P,96 contributions,May 2017,"If you visit to Bali, dont forget to visit Nusa Penida and this beach. Along with other places in Nusa Penida, you can find the genuine views of the sea and beach. I am agree with other reviewers, I am worry these places will be commercialized soon. If you visit to Kelingking Beach, you can see the blue ocean and of course the cliff. Please be careful if you walk to down side. No more words than say its a great holiday"
Tma,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2017,This is a must see on your visit! Amazing view and you can walk down to the beach if you brace the steep broken path.
Ardi P,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2017,I just want to stay this is amazing. Nice place in nusa penida. With white sands and blue oceans üëåüëå
rohand999,"Pune, India",Sep 2017,this cannot get anything less than full stars. Just see the photos posted by travelers and you would know why. Go now before it gets commercialized.
VLASH13,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Though the way to the place is quite bumpy and looong, when you get there, it was all worth it.Too bad I went there after having too much fun in Bali Island, so when I got there, I was all tired from the nights at the club ^.^""I didn't go to the beach which waaay down there, but now that I'm home, I regretted it. I'll definitely will go again next time."
elsemiekedeunk,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",Sep 2017,"Although they say it's dangerous, the hike to the beach is very nice when you've good shoes. Highly recommended to go down, but be careful though! "
alexfilip95,"Grosseto, Italy",Sep 2017,"The best beach of Bali and islands around, situated in Nusa Penida island , 1 hour far from bali by fast boat, it s one of the best beaches i've ever seen and i've seen many in my life, it was incredible, first day we were there with guide and as long as we loved it so much we comed again nxt day and gone down to the beach , it s a little bit dangerous but it will be worth it once on the beach , definitely a must if u have enough time in Bali!"
James F,5 contributions,Sep 2017,Remember to take a few bottles of water!  Take your time if you are going to climb down to the beach!  It is not for the faint of heart but is absolutely worth the climb.  Enjoyed a couple of coconuts after the climb out to help with rehydration!
Tienti R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Breathtaking view, and I regret that I didn't go down to the beaches below. It's crowded but it's worthy of your time and effort. Peoples start to build facilities like toilet, local shop for you taking a rest in the hot temperature, enjoying the scene while drinking coconut."
agostonpeti,"Budapest, Hungary",Sep 2017,This place is the most amazing place i have ever visited. Fortunately we arrived earlier than most of the tourist did. We were alone on the beach. Cannot describe. You have to see. 30 mins trekking down (shoes highly recommended) 20 mins up. You can rest at the beach. 
Paul M,United Kingdom,Aug 2017,"We came here very early in the morning to beat the crowds! We had the whole place to ourselves and even climbed down the precarious path to the beach. The roads leading to this place are very dodgy so be cautious, if you're inexperienced on a scooter be careful!! We stayed here for a couple of hours and by the time we climbed back to the top from the beach people were arriving  and would definitely of changed our experience for the worse so make the effort in coming here early! We took lots of pictures and nobody was in any of them!The beach isn't safe to swim in either as the waves are to crazy!"
Jesslyn W,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"not far from Pasih Uug there is another beach in Nusa Penida called Kelingking Beach. Because of the shape that resembles the finger Kelingking (little fingger), we can go down to swim or just play water. the water is very clear and white sand, if we are lucky we can see Manta Ray fish even in large quantities. Will never regret visiting this place"
Nadiaandita,"Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Kelingking Beach have beautiful scenery, but you have to climb a long way to go down until 1 hour and very hot. nothing to do in there just taking photos"
ireneario,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Very beautiful scenery from above to the blue turquoise sea, got a great fotos of this beach, need a short deep dawn hill to get best spot for foto but it worth it üëçüèæ"
Evelien K,5 contributions,Sep 2017,You have to climb a long way down so put on good shoes and don't go in the middle of the day (too hot)
Globe T,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2017,Lovely view point and excellent spot for photography. Lovely place to visit when in PENIDA island. Good
Pappmelinda,"San Mateo, CA",Aug 2017,"Breathtaking view! We saw huge manta rays swimming below, they must have been at least 6-8ft across. I wish we had more time and hiked down to the beach below. "
Dan R,"Busan, South Korea",Aug 2017,"Beautiful views from the top! The stairs looked a little dangerous to walk down, although many people were doing so, if you plan on doing it, I'd definitely bring proper shoes, as I slipped at the top in flip flops. The colour of the water looks just like the photos."
laorajj,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2017,"Once you arrive to Kelingking Beach you will see one of the most beautiful landscapes of the island! You can also go down, I tried but I didn't feel so comfortable so I came back. My boyfriend went down and he said that it is a little bit difficult but could be manageable. The beach is very beautiful, we could even see mantas from the top on the sea!"
MissPixieLix,Sydney Australia,Aug 2017,"This place looks like a postcard. You can if you like walk or hike right down to the bottom, but we were told it's not the easiest place to get to. We were happy to take pics from the top. Beautiful "
zeeyogy,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2017,"A hidden treasure, quite easy to get there by bike/car (remember to bring small change for parking fees).  Aerial view of the beach is just a minute walk from the parking area itself; getting down to the beach is a 45 minute trek. Not advisable for the those who are unfit. Untouched beach, a perfect place to get a tan, relax and unwind."
NidhiRana,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,One of the best beaches I have ever seen. Water is so blue & sand is so white. You have to trek down to reach this beautiful beach but it is totally worth it.
Vijay_Leo,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2017,"Hidden beach which literally 'appears' in front of you... view is breathtaking, with numerous shades of blue all around, school of fishes in the vicinity, with an occasional Manta Ray... walk down to the beach is tiring, but worth the effort... a true hidden treasure... Must Visit"
Danqu,"Frankfurt, Germany",Aug 2017,"You can just enjoy the view fro the top or go down to the beach if you have good shoes, are ready to do some climbing and steep descent and are in good fisical form. "
Grace B,"Penguin, Australia",Aug 2017,"In our flip flops and dresses we got the this beach expecting just a nice swim.... little did we know we were about the hike down the scariest hike of our lives. Holding on for dear life on the floppy bamboo fencing, and gripping on the rocking sandy path. We spoke to many people on the way about it they said it was definitely an adventure. They were right. It was the most memorable adventure of Nusa Penida. It took about an hour for a group of 7 girls to get down. Once reaching the bottom the sizes of the waves become huge to you and you realise that all the hard effort you put into getting down can not be rewarded with a swim, but just a dipping of the feet. Many girls getting knocked over by the force of the waves. After a nice relaxing lie down and looking up and around what you just conquered it's time to head back up. Going barefoot up and down was what we did. And I must say with a little help from upper body strength going up was a lot easier. I'll never forget that afternoon and the views are incredible!!"
linachen,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"This place is owesome. The white of the sand and the fierce of the wave are incredible even you have to get down from the high hill (above +/-1.9km from up stair) But your effort will pay off when you get down to the hill. Using the right shoes will help you easier to reach the beach. Trust me, you have to reach the beach when you @Pantai Kelingking, Nusa Penida or you will be regret :)"
Waleed F,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,The beach down the hill is amazing if you have the fitness to go down and come back to the top again after finishing.
Corwin I,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Aug 2017,"The view from above is amazing, but after the climb it's even better! Don't mistake the claims down, it's hard! But worth it! "
Ronit Dalvi,"Ostend, Belgium",Jul 2017,"This beach is also called t-rex point as the cliff resembles the shape of a t-rex,  it's a beautiful place to visit, you can get to the beach from the t-rex point, it's a short hike, wearing good shoes comes in handy.This is one of the best place on the nusa penida island.Must visit."
Jennifer S,"Berlin, Germany",Aug 2017,"It is a really nice place. After a bumpy ride you have to pay 5k for parking and then you find the view. It is really crowded and people are making really dangerous ""stunts"" just for the ""best"" selfie. I always though it's a rumour that people are putting there selfs in dangerous situations for the perfect selfie but there you go‚Ä¶Other than that it is a really nice place üëçP.S make sure you have enough petrol in your scooter "
suviatyw,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Amazing view, this place was a bit far, drive need 2 hour. But  view was very very beautifull .... worth it, with long jorney and the road go there was very bad and small. Difficult to past between 2 car."
Kevin L,101 contributions,Aug 2017,This is the most eye-opening place that I've ever visited in bali.The landscape and lovely blue coloured sea and sky makes the bumpy motor-bike ride there worthwhile.
Lina chandra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,Beautiful view from the top and so many people will queue to take the photos at the edge facing the beach down under but be careful as you may fall down ! Some accidents happened before when people doing selfie. You may go down to Kelingking beach but the steps is dangerous and steepy. I dont recommend unless you are so fit and adventurous.You can take pictures at the dead tree and the bamboo boat paying only 5K per person.The coconut is rather expensive they charge you 25-30K for one. At this moment there is no restaurant so bring your own lunch box as the island has no many restaurants and less choice. But they do sell cup noodles.
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,Nusa Penida is such a beautiful island with one spot more beautiful than the other. Kelingling beach was breathtaking but we didn't have time to walk down the staircase and the top bit was filled with tourists. Hopefully next time we will get to walk down for better views. 
Lokaris,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Kelingking is awesome, every step descending offers different view. We didn't manage to reach the beach as sunset is approaching and am awared that it takes a whole lot of stamina and flexibility to reach the beach, which I don't have that time.Thanks to the people who did great job attaching the handle and steps that made it safe to reach the beach. Sunset was stunning.  "
Lawrensha,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2017,"One of Best spot on Nusa Penida you must visit. The beach is like a little finger (or kelingking in Indonesia Languange). Beware of you take selfies, thr fences are very small. There's a staircase to walk down to the beach. Our guide told us it'll take about 35-40 minutes each way. I wished we had more time but it was a daytrip and we wanted to see other places so we didnt Go ahead down to the beach."
Carlotripad,11 contributions,Jul 2017,"This place has a magnificent view. The road to get there is not too bad, but once you approach the cliff, make sure to have good shoes for climbing down to the beach. Totally worth it!"
Eshita17,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Feb 2017,"its the best I have ever seen , best in my Bali visit too !Our tour guide recommended it , absolutely mind blowing view of the Sea ...never seen someplace so picture perfect and beautiful !!!"
clairecremeens,"San Marcos, TX",Jul 2017,"Simply wow. This was by far the most beautiful beach I've ever seen...but I had to earn my access to it. The stairs and handrails are strong enough to hang onto, but you'll be taking some big steps down. Going back up is an actual climb. But to get to one of the most beautiful white sand beaches and bluest water, it was worth it entirely!"
Ruth T,82 contributions,Jul 2017,"This is one of the best view in Nusa Penida! The stunning cliffs and clearly pearly greenish blue waves will overwhelm you. Yes, we can climb down the cliff to its beach. For me it's worth one try because the beach is just the same look with the ones from other parts of world. But hey, it's a really nice holiday photoshoot down there. Be careful on your way down and up, it's really steep. The government and locals have installed wooden (bamboo?) to help you gripping along the way, but still we all need to concentrate when going down and up. I think it will be best if we visit Kelingking around 8-10 o'clock in the morning. First, it won't be very hot (walking down and up the cliff won't be comfort at the noon. It burns). Secondly, maybe the crowd has not arrived so we are more free exploring and taking picture. The road leading to the beach has now been improved. It's only some bumpy road, but mostly it's smooth.You must visit this place when you are in Bali! Enjoy :)Ps: bring water"
Dirk G,26 contributions,Jul 2017,Such a amazing view! You can also descent to the beach but the stairsvare pretty crazy...and you will not be able to swimmat all becausenof very strong current
NafeeTA,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2017,"You need to trek through a steep but safe path to get down to the beach, somewhat tiring, but totally worth the trek. One of the must visits in Bali"
Ayu wulandari,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"we start our journey with this marvelous beach And it hit us! We saw the hill track from upside and thaught it will be not that 'hardcore' but after 5 min down, yes we fell the rock. They still don't have proper stair to step, instead they have temporary made by wood handle and stair. We really train our muscles here, running breath, and tears (for my sister lol). It was mostly like wall climbing without any safe as the hill is really steep. You have to prepare your physic and mental before you down because once you did no one ever can lift you up and down even a helicopter. Lol. But every those drama are really worth it! The beach is aweeeeesome. Ps : i suggest you to climb down and feel the water. It's really worth it.And please wear your shoes rather than flip flops :D"
Josefine J,"Link√∂ping, Sweden",Jul 2017,"Amazing experience! We climbed down and took a bath at the beach, it was wonderful! The climb though was very hard and steep, so not recommended for the old or badly trained people üòÅ"
Sanchita G,26 contributions,Jul 2017,Colour of the water is surreal. Avoid rainy days if possible.No pictures can do justice to the actual view. A must visit. If you are travelling without kids (unlike us) do trek down
barryjap,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Jul 2017,I wished we had more time but it was a daytrip and we wanted to see other places so we didnt Go ahead! down to the beach itself. I recommend highly to speare some time and Go ahead! down to the beach. We saw a manta from all the way up plaing near the beach....how cool is that?
Greg Massacra,"Galway, Ireland",Jul 2017,Another point of trip on Nusa Penida you must see. Unfortunately we didn't go down to the bottom as we wre already after all day walking but view from the top is spectacular. Colour of water and sand is so beautiful. And all rocks around it. Ahhhh... :-)
marcel l,28 contributions,Jun 2017,"Even the view from above is amazing. Great place for panorama pictures. Way to the beach is easy to find, parking for 2000Rp.If you wanna climb down to the beach you should bring solid shoes.  It is a bit hard to do it in thongs /flip flops.Once your are down at the beach... it is fantastic.Nice sand... good waves and less people.Keep the beach clean and take your rubbish with you. "
IUlv,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2017,"Beautiful view and a highlight in Nusa Penida. The hike down to the beach was a bit scary, but I'm happy we did it. It was well worth it and a good workout. "
pohling_foo,"George Town, Malaysia",Jun 2017,The t-Rex head. Beautiful spot for pictures! There's a staircase to walk down to the beach. Our guide told us it'll take about 35-40 minutes each way. 
blue_ring001,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"We chartered a speed boat out of Sanur Semawang beach and travelled for 45 minutes to Crystal Bay. This is one of the popular dive site to look for mola mola or sun fish. But this was not a dive trip so we jumped to the white sandy beach and a car already waited for us. The driving time to kelingking beach took about an hour because the road condition was not perfect. Once we arrived, the spectacular view made you forget all the bumpy and slow drive. The view from above the cliff was just amazing, perfect for picture taking. We could walk down 100 meter to the beach but decided not to because I was not sure we can climb back up. The best approach would be to walk down the cliff and leave by boat from the beach below."
mollfrog,"Newcastle, Australia",Jun 2017,"Kelingking Beach is about 30 mins from Crystal Beach by scooter. The middle part of the journey is quite bumpy due to the notoriously pothole-filled roads, which get better closer to the destination. Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat). I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled). Both the descent and ascent are quite laborious, and the pocari sweat back up top was welcomed gladly. This experience was unbelievable. I would do it again in a heartbeat. "
Darmanto S,"Malang, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Hidden beach below 350m cliff. Not prepare to walk down, but still worth to see from the top. Very beautiful nature"
socrwill,"Redding, CA",Jun 2017,This is the most dangerously beautiful place I have ever seen or been. Climbing down 2000 feet of raw cliff via slippery spots with a small bamboo rail and rope is no small task for a guy afraid of heights. Having a 20' wave take your feet out from under you is also very humbling. Being alone with the most beautiful woman on the most spectacular beach in Bali is bucket list priceless!
Max C,"Palm Beach, FL",Jun 2017,Need to be in decent shape to do this. We went to the bottom. It was not an easy hike. It was short but very tough coming from the bottom. Practically wall climbing - using more of your arms then legs at first. Incredible sights from every point during the hike. Beach at the bottom is the most beautiful beach I've ever been on. 
harry_mdj,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2017,"The beach is actually a narrow white sand beach between cliffs like Atuh Beach. The differences from Atuh are the beach is hardly to be accessed (the nature stairs tens meters down to the beach is slippery and very narrow and steep.The Kelingking secret point has a very beautiful panoramic view to the cliffs and the beach bellow.Some say it's kind of Navagio Beach, Greece."
Chrys,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2017,"This place has a unique rock formation, other than Broken Beach. It was named Kelingking Beach and it may refer to the indonesian word for ""thumb"" but idk it does not look like a thumb for me lol. The view is spectacular and I would really love to go to the beach down there but I don't have the guts to do it so I just stay on the top of the cliff and adore the view."
Frostburne,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2017,"Visited the place for day trip from Sanur.  This place is 30 min away from the port. The road is a bit bumpy so watch out.  But the view is well worthed.  The beach is like a little finger (or kelingking in Bahasa).  Beware of you take selfies,  thr fences are very small. "
maleeam23,"Bozeman, MT",May 2017,GORGEOUS!!! Views from here are incredible!! If you get there early enough you can hike down to the beach which would be AWESOME but it would be quite a trek. We went on a tour with Discover Nusa Penida which I would highly recommend! Must see highlight of our trip!!
196A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,Beautiful cliff and horizon view. Located less than an hour by car from Angel's Billabong / Broken Beach. You can enjoy the view from above or you can go down to the beach with a note; you have to be in good condition. It requires a great stamina to go steep 500-700ft down and climb back. At some point your knee will be in front of your belly while climbing up the steep stairs (if it can be called so). The path also not really safe since there was no fence/net/bar good enough to prevent accident.
MADHURKJAIN,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2019,"Beautiful and pristine Bech with clear waters. Enjoyed a lot of water sports also like water scooter, parachutes, sea walk. A nice combination of adventure and relaxation"
mmuazhiim,83 contributions,Oct 2019,Beautiful and stunning view of the beach. Clear blue sky . The landscpae of this place itself is so breathtaking i cannot explain with my own words.
Sam Ibrahim,"Sanur, Indonesia",Dec 2019,You arrifve and are immeditely overwhelmed by the natural beauty/serinity; you can stay there all day take in the natural beauty of the location.  
Aslam_Sherif,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Nusa Dua are the best beaches I saw on Bali. Nusa Dua is all about beach walking, sunbathing, swimming or water sports. Walking along this beach in the evening is very relaxing."
JodyBonny,"Mendrisio, Switzerland",Dec 2019,Move to the central area. Wave and tides clean away plastic scraps and alga. Much cleaner and easy swimming
Patricia R,3 contributions,Nov 2019,Truly a remarkable and pristine area. Can thoroughly recommend the whole area. Such a pleasure to meander along the whole area. 
David Read,46 contributions,Sep 2019,"I first reviewed Nusa Dua beach in 2018 and commented that in late November/December the water was absolutely full of rubbish and gave it only 3 stars because of that. I want to give credit where its due and say that 12 months later it was absolutely stunning and not a single bit of rubbish could be seen. The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out. Based on my two visits (so far) that seems to be the case.So its only fair that I mention that in September 2019 it was fantastic and postcard perfect. We all enjoyed going for walks from the Novotels 2.28 Beach Club up to the Waterblow. Lots of great little bars and places to eat you can just stop in by the way and plenty of squirrels everywhere for people to feed ;)Hope its the same this later this year when we return - easily one of the best beaches in Bali, much better than the tourist traps over in Kuta/Legian. The black sand beaches up in Tabanan and Tanah Lot  are only better because there's no-one on them :)"
Susan Z,"Madrid, Spain",May 2019,It was nice to place to relax beach! It was great to be for swiming. It was very clean and quite water to dove in! Will recommend it
Maria B,"Lappeenranta, Finland",Oct 2019,"Nice, clean and long beach with cafes and restaurants. Also has green walking territory. Especially great for early morning photosets at sunrise time "
PrestonGuild,United Kingdom,Jun 2019,A very good beach maintained by the hotels. It is cleaner than say Kuta beach and less busier.We went for a dip in the sea but much preferred to swim in the hotel pool. There is a safe swimming area.You will have people wandering around selling stuff and boat trips but they do not hassle you too much. Just say a polite no.I found it a nice play to relax and enjoy the sun.
GrandTour817128,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"Gorgeous view, clean and white sandy beach, secluded from local inhabitants. Perfect place for enjoying beach and lying on sun bed all day long"
Ashish J,"Pinner, UK",Dec 2019,We spent about an hour at the beach. We clean and nice beach. You can find the shade to sit in even on a hot day. A good place to watch the world go by as you bring your own pace down. Do visit the beach if you have a couple of hours to spare and are in South Bali.
Adri Rozali Sandi,"Gunung Putri, Indonesia",Dec 2019,Go here in the morningLow currentLow tideClean white sandy beachKids safely played and swim hereWe visited our hotel beach clubEnough number day bed and lounger bedA shower room
Tony Halim,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Most beaches here are privately managed by the hotels and thus are very clean. Only issue here is you can't catch the sun set as it faces the East. 
Purnima Banka,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"The beaches are clean and beautiful, surrounded by all luxury hotels. It has a bali collection mall which also leads to the beach, this place is vibrant and is nested with many pretty cafes and restaurants, with live music flowing in most of them. It certainly has a great vibe and awesome for some leisure time!!"
Amalia S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,Nice beach clean & easy to swim. We are happy to spend some time in here. Only food is the problem need to go back and forth to our fav resto. 
rodb987,"Grande Prairie, Canada",Dec 2019,Nice white sand large surfing waves quite a ways off shore at high tide. Most beaches are nicely maintained by hotels (raking up and burying the sea weed washing up on shore). Typical water sport activities for hire along beach. 
ThunderBear1982,"Hangzhou, China",Dec 2019,"I went with my wife for a leisurely swim. We stayed in Jimbaran, but many friends had told me Nusa Dua Beach was a must see. It wasn't.It certainly wasn't terrible but there are far more stunning beaches in southern Bali to check out, such as Greenbowl and Suluban.The water was crystal clear, but you have to swim in swaths of seaweed and some plastic.The beach had many big resorts on it, but it didn't make the beach crowded. There is also a small restaurant and a hut where some locals provide massage, which my wife said was great."
Mudhoo,7 contributions,Dec 2019,Beautiful walk around the beach area. Nice view of sunset and blow hole. Safe for children to walk around the loop. Good surfing area. 
Pranab k,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Great beach if you are looking for privacy and experience of Bali beaches at the same time. Great for families 
Jan V,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Dec 2019,"It is a long, probably 4-5 km white sand strip to the East of Bukit paninsular with it's pros and cons. I would say the most fashionable beach with posh hotels manicured lawns and picturesque blue sea. Cons are the rocky coral sea base and plenty of algas in that season, so one has to hunt for a clean spot to enter the sea. I would line it third to Legian and Uluwatu beaches."
Stephen C,"1,055 contributions",Dec 2019,"Some would argue that Nusa Dua has become too commercialized as hotels are sprinkled all over this area. Along with that comes the restaurants and shops targeting tourists.But if you don't mind all that, then Nusa Dua beach is a must visit place. The currents are decent and you will spot many surfers riding the waves here.There is also a nice beach walk that links almost throughout the entire beach so you can just walk along to enjoy the landscaping that the different hotels put together.Certainly a nice place to just hang out and get a good tan. Waters are also safe for swimming."
Kelly S,32 contributions,Dec 2019,"This is a beautiful beach, plently of space so you won't be sitting on top of anyone and very clean water fine for swimming :-)"
Cherie H,"Roumazieres-Loubert, France",Dec 2019,"Great cove for swiming, its bouyed of for safety from boats going past. Loads of cafes and restuarnts and 5 star hotels along the s hjore and the great Bay area for chilled low cost time"

Nicky2015,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2019,"Don‚Äôt choose this beach if you want to surf: but it‚Äôs ideal for gentle Swimming, snorkeling and lounging with the family. Very pretty views and nice breezes in the afternoon from the beach club tables under the trees lining the resort. "
Nino,103 contributions,Dec 2019,The beach is filthy with sea weed and dirt everywhere.  The image of beautiful blue water is an absolute distortion of the truth.  In fact this is probably the worst beach I have been to.  Regret falling for false advertising on Nusa Dua 
Robert R,"Woodvale, Australia",Dec 2019,this beach is great!! very clean and shallow great for small kids its cleaned every day and water here is largely unpolluted 
DS of Hove,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Dec 2019,Our hotel (Marriott) had a reserved area of the beach with loungers and umbrellas plus a beach bar/cafe. We walked along the beach for 800 mtrs and it was very quiet. The beach is swept clean every night. There is a barrier of reefs 200 mtrs off the shore and a lagoon forms behind this but at low tide it is too shallow to swim in so find out the tides if you want to swim in the incredibly warm sea (it needs to be at least middle tide for a reasonable swim).
Sherpa26568007543,"Yuma, AZ",Dec 2019,Great public beach.  The each side is great for early morning walks on the beach.  The hotels make sure the beach is cleaned of seaweed each morning after the high tide.  The eastern beach is much better than the northern side past the 2 nusas
Mr. Hunter,"Port Vila, Vanuatu",Dec 2019,The beaches of Nusa Dua are heavenly but in December the heat might be overbearing. Its a great beach to make wonderful memories and forget about your worries in the city. An absolute gift from Heaven. 
James D,"Cronulla, Australia",Nov 2019,"We stayed at the Mulia Villas that had direct access to this beach and wow, talk about being spoilt , it seemed that as soon as you left footsteps in the sand they were raked over like a divot in a bunker.The water was clean and the surf breaking on the reef not too far out was also worth exploring at low tide.All up, clean and safe."
Stewartholt,"York, UK",Dec 2019,I'm assuming that the beach we visited from our hotel (Courtyard Marriott) was Nusa Dua Beach. If it wasn't then apologies for the review. We walked along the Beach area and it was quite well manicured but was large hotel after hotel after hotel after hotel. The sunbeds were quite crowded as well as the bed/pavilion structures. Hotel restaurants all the way along. We are leaving early to try Ubud then Gili. Fingers crossed
mary m,15 contributions,Dec 2019,Nusa dua beach is a little haven away from all the chaos of bali. It has a beautiful walking path along the side of the beach on one side and the other side are beautifully manicured gardens and resorts and also restaurants. We went jogging on the path every morning. There's hardly anyone hassling you to buy stuff.
Jayanth K,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2019,Nusa Dua Beach is one of the better maintained beaches of Bali.. there are options to play water sports.. be meticulous before getting into any watersport activity.  Bargain harder until they come down to your price.. they will eventually give in.. 
Jennifer B,"St. Mawgan, UK",Nov 2019,Beautiful beach to relax. Easy to walk through all the resorts along the beach front. It‚Äôs safe and friendly 
Fizzy6,Bibra Lake,Nov 2019,Beautiful beach with not too many hawkers and a lot of fun activities. Cold drinks served to your cabana and many spots to lounge on
Hmaspol,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"The beach where i stayed was not really clean and well arranged, maybe there was event during the weekend and too many people gather there."
valdowling,"Liverpool, UK",Dec 2019,Hawkers are well controlled and not the slightest bit intimidating.  Plenty of staff keeping the beach clean and tidy.
Old Pro,"Seattle, WA",Sep 2019,"In general, I felt Bali didn't have any particularly fantastic beaches . At least the ones I saw . This beach is a particularly it's not spectacular specially when compared to many of the beaches I've been to in the Caribbean. Kind of dull and without character and during the day turns into a big mud flap at low tide. So dull I didn't bother to take any pictures of it . But, I didn't come here for the beach oh, I came here to scuba dive. I took scuba tours two beaches that were very beautiful on penida Island. If beaches does what you like to do and don't particularly want an Indonesian style Hotel, pick a hotel on the west side of the island. It's much more crowded there and in my opinion not as nice but, there are nicer beaches."
Darren C,"Sentosa Island, Singapore",Nov 2019,"Beautiful & Cleanest beach I‚Äôve ever experienced. Offers water sports, plenty of free loungers & shade. Push button beach service. Night time beach seats & open fires, with marshmallow toasting for the kids. Love it!!"
Brian F,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2019,"I wandered across to Nusa Dua to catch Devdan Show and I‚Äôm glad I did as, besides the show being great, there might otherwise be a risk that I would one day stay around here. This place is stale, whitewashed hole devoid of any Balinese or Indonesian culture, somewhat ironic given I‚Äôd come to Nusa Dua for a cultural dance show. Why anyone would travel to a another country and pay overs to stay in a place like this is beyond me. The beaches aren‚Äôt even that good. "
215ayen,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,This tranquil environment is good for honeymooner and family traveller . It is away from noises and busy/ crowded places . 
ekholland27,"Amersfoort, The Netherlands",Nov 2019,It is sandy but not a beach to swimm. With low tide you have to walk far and there are lots of rocks. Even with high tide water comes up only to just above knees and lots if weed and plastic. Not the picture post card you would expect
Allison Doyle,"Berkeley Vale, Australia",Nov 2019,"This has to be one of the cleanest beaches in Bali. Yes Bali has Ocean pollution problems, there are plastic bags floating everywhere! Really opens eyes to what we humans are doing to this planet.As far as that goes this beach is very clean and the beach sellers are smaller in numbers as well."
EveT205,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"On my own with friends, i may not come here. The beach, beach front dining, sunset all so romantic. Business meetings are good too, not much distractions "
anushka r,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,Nice clean beach. Probably not very suitable for swimming or surfing as where i stayed had a huge reef.
Michael Z,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"If you are a Bali virgin looking for a base camp to explore the island, Nusa Dua area is a safe bet.  Covered by white sand, Nusa Dua beach is a private beach shared by 4 waterfront hotels.  Hotel guest can go from up and down the entire beach, but only use amenities in your own hotel.  Some people swim and snorkel right off the beach, most people just kick back and do nothing.  You can watch sunrise from the beach but not the sunset, because sun sets on the other side of the island.  "
Angelo F,27 contributions,Oct 2019,Beautiful beach. Great view when having drinks at Kul Kul Bar. Family friendly beach. Nusa Dua is the ideal area for those that prefer peace and quiet. 
Escape45459895596,3 contributions,Nov 2019,Water is full of grass and sea things... In the evening is very crowded of local people. Not recommending
Drjon,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Aug 2019,We stayed at Hilton Hotel Bali Resort at Nusa Dua which was strategically situated along the beach Enjoyed the majestic and natural settings The clifftop view was mesmerising at night Most satisfying was this place it being  away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta areaTranquility was deafening 
royjava6,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Oct 2019,"When on Bali you will find the coolest beaches, world famous all around the world. Nusa Dua is the mostly quiet beaches area at East-Bali, so be prepared for the most beautiful sunrises. Because of the reef the tide is huge. With low tide you can walk to the reef, take care of the low depths in which sea urchins can be. I loved just to sit down in the water, relaxing and enjoy the cool breeze, the floating seaweed. And watch lots of relaxations, like the banana boat rides and other water sports activities (parasailing, surfing, jet-skiing, kite boarding, snorkeling etc.). Too quiet? Take a nice walk along the Nusa Dua Promenade. And have a snack or a drink at one of the many many terraces."
Departure56317057068,54 contributions,Nov 2019,"Nice beach with clear, warm water.  Low tide/high tide is extreme and rapid. The water recedes about 30 ft from high tide and you can walk out to the reef in ankle deep water, which isn‚Äôt the greatest when you need to cool off, but pretty cool to see."
Fiona C,"Stroud District, UK",Sep 2019,"Didn't swim in this much, lots dark muddy areas n seaweed, string under currents too. Better to swim in the pools provided. "
Jayne,4 contributions,Nov 2019,Great beach for kids and relaxing! There‚Äôs not too many waves so calm for the kids to play without having to worry. They keep it very clean and tidy. There‚Äôs some friendly locals selling merchandise but not too many to be annoying 
James M,"Edinburgh, UK",Nov 2019,"Beach nice and is cleaned outside major hotels only of old sea weed. Found plastic along coast of beach, once tide is out not easy to access water as tide goes out quite far. Worth a visit if you are a beach person."
travellor186403,"Coventry, UK",Oct 2019,"Shallow waters, seriously hot and high humidity however lots of trees to take shelter under. one of the best beaches we have ever been to. fully reccomend"
Galos_Airo,"Barcelos, Portugal",Oct 2019,"The beach is nice but the main problem is the dirty (plastic, seaweed, grass, etc:) doesn't make you welcome or comfortable for a swim or even enjoy the sunny days."
LUX ESCAPES üåè üì∏,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2019,What I love most is how sheltered and calm the beach is . Even wirh a large swell the outer reefs take all the waves so it is very safe for swimming and using a paddle board etc. If you go snorkeling you can see fish and lots of star fish in the sand.  You can walk right along the path and past all the different 5 star resorts. You can also eat or have a drink at them which is nice on a sunny day.  Summary- CleanSafeFreeYou won't get hassled on beach like in kuta 
Jeff C,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2019,"Relaxing with a warm welcome, lovely hotels along the beach walk with beautiful views out over the sea. Lots of places to stop for a drink or lunch . Bali collection a-good find. Shops and restaurants with many kinds of different foods at very reasonable price compared to the hotels but no sea views . "

Darren J,Bendigo,Oct 2019,"It's a nice beach, however the resorts dominate so although you can walk along the foreshore you can't use the facilities unless you buy a drink at the overpriced bars"
QuebecDiver,"Mount Royal, Canada",Oct 2019,"People from Bali are very aware of plastic pollution, they do their best to keep the place clean.Very nice people!"
Edward L,"Manila, Philippines",Nov 2019,Not so nice beach. Great for strolling but not for swimming. Low tide during late afternoon for instagram pictures 
Steven G,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,"Stayed in Inaya Putri Bali. Service is great, efficient and friendly. Spend the whole day in the hotel to enjoy the facilities. Kids love the pool so much they didn‚Äôt want to leave. "
Jean1823,"Nagoya, Japan",Oct 2019,"we can swim but the water wasn‚Äôt very clear when we went.. but some parts have clear water, maybe it‚Äôs because of the waves. nice and quiet where no vendors will keep disturbing you. it was very relaxing. we saw an angel fish swimming near the shore."

SamueleSb,Luxembourg,Oct 2019,"Nisa Dua is the area of resorts in south Bali, so it's not really the authentic Bali, but it's a pleasent place to spend few days  relaxing on the beach. There are also many shops and restaurants and the big Bali Collection shopping centre with a huge selection of restaurants."
Strong_hoses,7 contributions,Oct 2019,It is simply so clean and amazing which shows how much care people of Bali Island have given to give us this satisfying experience. The water is crystal clear and the sand almost massages your feet. I highly recommend this beach to people of all ages and be sun safe!
Dr Parth,"Bhavnagar, India",Oct 2019,"You can enjoy water activities mainly in nusa Dua Beach in Bali. The paragliding, banana boat, scuba dive are the main attraction there.Be aware when you purchase any tour package because they might not include ticket for these activities. "
David S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,if you‚Äôre looking for a tranquility then go to Nusa Dua beach. The ambience is so calm & peace. I would love to see the wave coming to the shore. 
staniland66,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"Beautiful when the tide is in,  but a bit bleak when the tide is out. Very nice walk from the temple on the headland to Sofitel. Also a nice path at the back of the beach for cycling"
Lisha C.,"Las Pinas, Philippines",Sep 2019,I loved the walk to this beach. It is not as big or as well-kept as other popular beaches on the island but it is free and the walkway from the Grand Hyatt hotel was a great way to see the gardens and get to the beach front. You can also get here from the park neat the Waterblow site.
Nevena P,"Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia",Sep 2019,"The place overall it's very nice, a lot of nice hotels are around, but we did't have a very good expirience on the beach... First of all the wather was very dirty, it was hot but it wasn't nice to swim or enjoy in the wather which was that dirty. When we got out of the wather it was very windy so the sand was all over us, we were hoping that the wind will stop, but it didn't... The other thing that we didn't like was that you have signs on the beach that if you go in the wather you will swim on your own responsability, when you will see red flag on the beach it's high danger, the yellow flag shows medium danger, and the green flag shows no danger at all, but we were walking a lot and all we saw was the red flag, so it was not nice to swim in wather and know that there is a risk something to happen to you... If you are not swimer you can just seat and enjoy in the view, the beach it's beautifull in that point, nice white sand and blue sea..."
GassyDoha,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,No words to express the beauty of this heaven on earth.Several amenities nearby to compliment your appetite. Perfect for honeymooners and couples.

VFrequentTravellers,"Point Lonsdale, Australia",Oct 2019,We stayed here for the first time and enjoyed the beach. Quite clean all round. Also a lovely walk alongside the beach most of it under lovely tree canopies. Highly recommended!
JaseNZ26,"Auckland, New Zealand",Oct 2019,Pretty good beach I would say. Mostly people swimming outside the Inaya or Ayoda resorts. Colder than the hotel pools. Waves can pull you out a bit so be careful with children. See locals fishing out there as well. People surfing. Sand gets very hot during the day. Otherwise nice view and good to relax in front of with a beer.
R3N4,14 contributions,Oct 2019,"Whenever we come to Bali, we keep on staying at nusa dua. Either at sofitel, mulia, westin, clubmed or nusa due beach resort they situated next to each other on same stretch. You literally can walk from end to end the walking path is well kept and safe. Best for honeymooners or even family. "
shweta_jadhav,"Thane, India",Oct 2019,"Beautiful private beach, clean beach. Safe for travellers and good place to relax and unwind with few bars on the beach"
KodoDrummer,"Yekaterinburg, Russia",Oct 2019,This is the only beach I've been to where there is a dramatic difference between high and low tide. At low tide it didn't look so nice on the right hand side of our hotel. The overall quality of the beach is self evident from the many nicer hotels backing onto the beach.
murray_peter113,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,We chose to stay at aresort next to the beach. The main problem was that for the first week thw tide seemed to out for most of the day so it was not suitable for swimming but in the second week the high tide was in the middle of the day and we had a great swim. The sand is white unlike the busy Kuta side of the island. It is not really busy and a really relaxing way to spend your holidays layong around and observing the view. Evidently there were dangers like stepping on sea urchins at low tide but signs alerted you to the dangers. The low tide provided you with the opportunity to walk out to the edge of the reef and look in the rock pools. 
Petra L,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Nov 2018,"We have been in Bali in 1999, staying in Sanur and we said if we ever come again we will stay in Nusa Dua, because we liked the beach so much.20 years later we return , the beach is nothing like it was.The water was dirty, trash everywhere...Really sad.But Bali still awesome!"
Rosa V,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,"I was disappointed in the beaches,if there were nice beaches in Nusa Dua I certainly didn‚Äôt find them,looks lovely at a distance but not up close but at night with the lights and surrounding restaurants in Nusa Dua it looked a picture"
AirineH,5 contributions,Oct 2019,"Nusa dua beach always been our favourite escape from the hectic life in Jakarta. The beach is clean, private, the view is great. We can just sit down and lie back under the tree and sleep without thinking about anything, what a relax way of spending a day!"
Pakemon Bali Tour,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2019,this place will satisfy your mind when you are in this place ..... fresh air is almost without pollution you can enjoy here ... it's not wrong if you make this place as one of your travel agenda on the island of Bali ....
Wixters,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2019,"Coming from WA where we have excellent beaches it was hard to like this beach.  The sand is very corse under foot.  The water did seem clear and our son enjoyed playing in it, but it‚Äôs not the quality we are used to.  At least the bean bags and sun beds under the parasols were free (2.28 beach club) for Novotel guests.  I think it‚Äôs a cheek asking 33000 for a small bottle of water then adding %21 service charge on top."
Alison G,9 contributions,Sep 2019,Beautiful beach. Nice and quiet. Always  clean. Good choice of restaurants and cafes along the length.
Lina K,2 contributions,Sep 2019,"One of the rare beaches where you could actually swim in Bali. Even in low tide, it is still swimmable on some places. But, be there earlier, cause the sun sets before 17h and not in the ocean, as it sets in Kuta.Clean and lovely!"

Timir P,"London, UK",Sep 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is a splendid location to spend the day. It is large and open with no restrictions along the way, each hotel along the beach has loungers which are kept away and don't interrupt a pleasant walk. The beach is kept clean my the diligent staff of the hotels, and is a beautiful place to witness a sunrise."

ludu_mada,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Sep 2019,"I liked going to Nusa Dua Beach for 2 reasons: it was quiet (no music) and the beach wasn‚Äôt all full of sunbeds.

Neil K,20 contributions,Aug 2019,if you love sun you will love Nusa Dua.  If you are one of those that love sun but stay in the shade you will love being on the Nusa Dua Beach at the Nusa Dua Beach and Resort Hotel.  The beach is beautiful.  Water clean and employees just perfect.  You will learn to love them all as we have over the years.  Try here and you will see just how wonderful life can be.

Ellen P,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"Went here one late afternoon after having a spa at the nearby shopping center. It was low tide when we were there, so we just stroll along the beach. There were some people  jogging & cycling. There are seating along certain stretch of the beach, as well as some big restaurants & a beach club. The weather is nice & breezy in late afternoon. Good for relaxing."
Pedro_Collins68,"Box Hill, Australia",Aug 2019,"This was our first visit to Nusa Dua beach. We have been to Seminyak in a previous trip so we were so surprised to see that the beach was so beautiful to swim in. There are water sports on the beach, people playing volleyball and a beautiful atmosphere. It‚Äôs a must to visit. I had some preconceived ideas that it would be expensive but it really wasn‚Äôt. And in some cases the shopping was cheaper than Seminyak. Would visit again. Especially with young children and families. "
greenmanners,4 contributions,Sep 2019,"I had a few swims in Nusa Dua this year and on a holiday last year.  While the swimming is good and the snorkelling is amazing (lionfish, angelfish, honeycomb moray eel etc) the sea is full of plastic and other rubbish.     "

The time we went, wasn‚Äôt busy at all which meant we had our own spot to relax on. Definitely worth a trip to this beach. Restaurants on the beach sideline, but limited amount so more are needed."
melaniew762,"Dallas, TX",Sep 2019,"Great for runs along the seaside, lounging in sun chairs or swimming! Beautiful beach with a nice boardwalk as well. "
Village49,"Bellevue, WA",Mar 2019,Wonderful beach to enjoy. Overall pretty clean for Bali. Be sure to bring your sun tan lotion. Nice restaurants near by. 
somalghamdi,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2019,I loved this place because the atmosphere is very romantic and very quiet with no noise of the city‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Graeme W,15 contributions,Jul 2019,"I recently swam at the Nusa Dua beach adjacent to the Grand Hyatt Resort. The combination of a protective reef, warmer water and relative absence of under tows made my water experience a memorable one. The water & sands are pristine & the gentle on shore breezes were very relaxing and perfect for the sport of kite flying. A short walk to the north takes you to the blowhole point where spectacular waves crash onto the rocks & explode high into the air to the delight of the many onlookers.  There are quite a lot of shade trees along the foreshore if sunbathing is not your thing which incidentally are populated by many cheeky squirrels who demand to be fed despite the practice being warned against by numerous signs in the area. To sum up, this is a beautiful clean beach which will not disappoint."
Michael mcamis,4 contributions,Aug 2019,Great place for families or solo trip. The hotel is very accommodating. Cathey PACIFIC/DRagon AIRLINES lOST oR went tHOUGH my luggage   mY sEIZURE mEDICATION cAME UP MISSING. they have a  DR at the resort that was helpful. BEAUTIFUL VIEWS. right next to the beach. prenty to do great shopping Just down the street as well
Simon B,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Sep 2019,"A lovely walk on wide paved path that runs behind Nusa Dua beach is terrific experience. Whether watching action (water sports) on water, tourist play/relax on beach or the amazing resorts/gardens. Best times around dawn and dusk."
Greg W,"North Sydney, Australia",Sep 2019,"Probably one of very few beaches I would actually swim in. It‚Äôs clean and the waves manageable for those of us that is not into surfing. Also the Hotels hire people to continually clean the stretch of beach so you don‚Äôt get to see rubbish, plastics, or even seaweed. A must go to swimming area if you are close by. "
Carlos L,"Lisbon, Portugal",Sep 2019,"small, windy and almost always low tidelots of boats arriving and a smell of gasoline when they arrive"
Sheila W,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Aug 2019,"This beach is the one of the best - pristine and looks fabulous but no-one on it!! Not sure whether it was just the area we staying at but the sand was so fine you couldn't walk on it - deserted, everyone around the pool."
Glenn T,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,A clean beach with a big rocky area to explore during low tide. Nice and clean and hence good for running as well.
Silvia Kezia,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"I came here twice and the perfect time is the second one, not too crowded and so calm. See the blue sea and it was high enough."
Jude-escapes,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2019,"Some were snorkeling, paddle boarding and a few surfing... I just strolled and enjoyed the peninsula with its views and photo opportunities. there‚Äôs a blowhole also."
dmcallis73,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,Being secluded makes the beach really nice and clean water quality is great compared to busier beaches closer to main tourist areas like Seminyak.
Niknut57,"Mildura, Australia",Sep 2019,"This beach changes every hr. You have the view of Mt Agung, you have an enormous tide that goes out 500 mt, warm water for swimming or snorkelling (not much fish) and some waves to have fun with. Not far away you can do all the water activities like Jet ski, parasailing, banana ride etc etc. Most of the beach is quiet, tranquiel and the sand is great."
Der_Macher68,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2019,I nice spot in Bali if you want to relax on a nice white sand beach and swimming in a clear water.I'd reccomend to stay more towards the Inaya hotel where the beach is larger and less impacted by low tide in the afternoon.There is all along the way a walking/jogging path where you can train or just enjoy the sea breezeIt is a quite and safe place so don't expect to much night activities.Close by there is Bali Collection where everyone can find the best restaurant to fit own tastes
gwalior95,"Edmonton, Canada",Aug 2019,it is a wonderful sandy beach . kids loved to play in sand and water . there are water activities available . we were staying at the Inaya Resort  so enjoyed the beach which was clean . there were times when there were high tides and the life guards put out the red flags .  
Bhavs,"Greater London, UK",Aug 2019,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt and went to the Nusa dua beach and it was absolutely fantastic it was lovely and clean. The sand was so nice and soft and the kids loved playing in it. There was no litter at all and it was safe for them to play in unlike some beaches this was an amazing beach to build a sandcastle on and we all had great fun doing so. There was also a swing on the beach which was very popular with all the guests young and old. Well worth a visit if you are in Bali, one of the nicest beach we have been to and stayed at. "
Stuart Priestley,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,This was our first visit to Bali and Nusa Dua is simply stunning and a perfect location to explore Bali from. 
CanadaWestCoast,"Vancouver, Canada",Aug 2019,Nusa Dua  is a great place to stay. The beach offers a few kilometers of sandy beaches to walk up on. The hotels in the area are excellent stays and often just a walk to the beach or offer a shuttle service. We stayed at the courtyard by Marriott which was absolutely fantastic!
Lorraine22021968,"Kirkcaldy, UK",Aug 2019,"Lovely beach with nice sands to walk along, when the tide is out u can walk for ages although the water is fairly shallow "
Fotis Damas,1 contribution,Jul 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is glorious , white sand, deep and long.It‚Äôs safe to say that bali beaches have an identity of their own and can leave its imprints on your hearts"
Dean Manu,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"This a nice beach in south of bali. You can relaxing your self and enjoy a Long Beach with the white sand, surfing and another activity"
wanderlust,46 contributions,Aug 2019,"The low tide on Nusa Dua gets so low that you can't even swim in the water anymore. You have to go so far out. Also it's all lined up with fancy resorts, so not a great place to chill if you want food options that aren't extremely expensive. Definitely not the best beach to go to in Bali unless you're staying in one of those resorts. but yeah, low tide (like all afternoon) makes the ocean unswimmable. "
Valentina C,"Santorini, Greece",Aug 2019,Not Bali best place to stay too much quiet. Seems to be better Kuta if you are not travelling with children and family.Beach nothing special as the ocean do not allow to swim so pool is needed.Hotel and accomodations expensive.
AliMaddo,Cambridge,Aug 2019,"We enjoyed this beach, the waves break far out leaving it calm and safe for the children. My only thing would be to say to the local community and hotels in the beach to please have a concerted effort to clean up the plastic daily, if not twice daily to take the plastic out of the ocean and stop producing plastic in the island too. "
Dr Awesome,"Richmond, New Zealand",Aug 2019,Beautiful beach but sadly let down by the activities of humans. The staff do their best to clear rubbish but it's sad to see the lack of respect for the planet. The ocean was full of debris and litter (plastic mainly).
Laci_Sz,"Budapest, Hungary",Aug 2019,"It's a nice beach, good for families. Bit overcrowded and overpriced as the majority of bars and grills are the property of top resort hotels in Nusa Dua. Anyway - worth a visit."
Gina P,"Sunninghill, UK",Jul 2019,Lovely beach in Bali.  Very touristy area but still a lovely holiday area for relaxation.  We stayed at the Westin and highly recommend.
Judy H,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,We walked along the beach yesterday and marvelled  at its beauty and tranquility. It is also very clean. We stopped at one of the bistros and enjoyed the scenery with a refreshing fruit drink.
andiswa‚ù§Ô∏è,South Africa,Aug 2019,It was a very gorgeous beach. Lots of activities to do for all ages. I would highly recommend visiting this beach. 
James N,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Good beach. Warm waters although strong currents in places. Coral/reef just off shore where the crashing waves are. Beautiful tropical fish- Moray eel, Angel fish, rass, clownfish. Just off coast. Wonderful."
Kristin J,"Tallinn, Estonia",Aug 2019,"Really clean beach with warm water. Sunbathing chairs owned by hotels, so if you want them you should pay. Price range 200 000-400 000 rupiah. A lot of water activities to do."
zoe z,9 contributions,Aug 2019,"We like the peacefulness there, beautiful scenery, cool breeze, smooth sand. You won't get bunch of people lying around in the background of your photos. LOL"
Endru_06,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2019,So relaxing. Beach is clean. Not so crowded. Easy to find. Come for many time already. Very nice place
Rafael Hengky,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Sofitel Nusa Dua Bali hotel voucher for sale. A 2 nights stay at Luxury Room with Pool access. Inclusive of full board meal, access to Club Millesime, Balinese Massage, Bicycle tour, Archery activity.It is said that the voucher worth 25,000,000 IDR. I would like to sell it for 10,000,000 IDR. I got from prizes and not intended to use it."
Sailesh S,"Stanhope Gardens, Australia",Aug 2019,Been here twice at Novotel Nusa Dua private beach. Love the water and beach compared to Legian and Kuta. It is kept reasonably clean. There is a slight current in some places but water is refreshing and great to swim in.
DocC27,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jun 2019,This is the perfect area to go for water sports.We stayed at Kuta and Nusa dua is very close. lovely packages for all kinds of watersports.
marianne s,Milan,Jul 2019,"beautiful area with excellent Hotels and quiet area...after visiting Kuta, Seymiak, Denpasar are we glad to go too this area"
BillUK32,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Go for a long long walk early morning to see the sun rise or later at sunset. You can walk 5km around it and back. I prefer this to Kuta, Lovina beach and Seminyak."
Maria P,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"Spent some time at the Mulia Resort but also swam and snorkelled at the beach.  The water was warm, the beach had quite a few bits of sharp coral but was reasonably clean.  There were lots of fish whilst snorkelling but the locals were feeding them bread.  Probably not the best diet for the fish.  Pity.  I should mention the loud, arrogant, partying European tourist from the resort but it was NYE after all."
ziga v,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Aug 2019,The beach and the whole ITDC area was a bit of a let down for me as apart from the top hotels the moment you step outside the hotel area the surroundings are not what you would expect from a world class destination. It all looks a bit half completed and missing the key details.The beach itself is nice to look at and stroll around it but for swimming not really good as the waves are high and the water is not so clean so if you stay in one of the resorts you will swim in the pools for sure. Also the offer of the beach clubs really not on high level so again in the resorts its all great but outside not much.
buddy m,13 contributions,Oct 2018,Having fun under the sun was the best thing to do in Bali with their fun water activities especially the banana boat riding and parasailing. It is a must try/things to do in Bali.
Christine Shelley,Perth,Jul 2019,Beach is sandy and the areas around the private beach clubs are kept nice and clean. Good path at top of beach for easy for walking and nice and shady.
DianaPei,"Shanghai, China",Jul 2019,"The beach is beautiful, but the water is not clean. It's not fine. white sand. There are too many stones, shells and seaweeds etc. on the beach, which makes playing at the seaside not so fun. We kept stepping on stones while at the water, and that was quite painful somtimes and could hurt kids."
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,Beautiful beach with white sands...lots of high end hotels in the area...things are expensive  in that area....we went to do the water sports in that area.
Razor Ray,"County Meath, Ireland",Jul 2019,A beautiful clear water beach with clean sandy beaches. The tide goes out about half a mile leaving pockets of warm clear water with starfish and other marine life in them. Absolutely beautiful. 
Umang A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,This white sand beach is the most beautiful beach in Bali. This place is beat for long walks and relaxing your your soul
Nicole W,"East Victoria Park, Australia",Jul 2019,First time stay for my daughter and I at Nusa Dua. Highly recommend this side of Bali. Very peaceful and beautiful. We will also stay in legion this trip but so glad to have come to Nusa Dua.
exact,"Drammen, Norway",Jul 2019,"not overcrowdedprotected by a reef so not big waves all the timepossible both to use if you want to have your towel just in the sand and possible to rent sunchairs in a couple of public areas, many beach clubs that belong to the hotels and are for their guestsbut no problem at all to find a lot of space can be a strong under currant when the waves get over the reef"
John E,"San Luis Obispo, CA",Jul 2019,"The water temperature was very warm. We did notice plastics floating in the water. The sand is very nice. Overall, a very good beach with many hotels."
nickS910HM,Cobham,Jul 2019,"Peaceful, nice sand and water is clean and good temperature. Laguna Beach hotel is a great location on the beach and offer a good service with drink and food for hotel guests. The beach sellers are also not too much, they want to sell you something but are never too pushy."
gazca,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,Nusa Dua beach is clean and safe with calm water. Great restaurants and bars along the beachfront. Great for couples and families.
BlueAnto,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,"Great location, friendly and very helpful locals. Balinese people mostly are quite hospitable. Definitely will be returning "
Alberto M,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"If you are looking for crystalline water this is not the place. The beach is good if you enjoy water activities like banana, sail parachuting, etcThe area to swim is pretty limited and the water not clean.The beach in front of the hotels is kept clean so people can enjoy nice sunbathing and use hotel services"
juvalesm,"Navi Mumbai, India",Apr 2019,"The beach is crowded by foreign tourists. It is clean somewhere, but seems polluted a little. Water sports are available. Overall nice experience walking on the shore."
Deanne,"Coulsdon, UK",Jul 2019,Went snorkelling here which was a total waste of time as there‚Äôs no fish in this area because of the amount of water sports and boats tearing around. Went in the water and my hair came out sticky?? Over crowded and full of rip offs. 
jen p,14 contributions,Jun 2019,Really thought this would be uninteresting and something I didn‚Äôt need to do because I have Florida and California beaches afterall.  I had a flight though and the hotels here are super super close to airport - 6 dollar ride. I had a early morning flight so I booked a room at the Luxury collection and it was a huge hit!  I wish we would have stayed longer here as the hammocks in the sea and the peaceful water and the swings in the sea that you can swing on are just exquisite!!
OGGI56,"Bathgate, UK",Jul 2019,"As a group of 3 adults and one 2yr old we had a fab time at the Nusa Dua beach hotel. The staff, facilities , restaurants and location was excellent. We would definitely recommend and if the opportunity arises would definitely go back. A good time was had by all."
1281deepa,"Dallas, TX",Jul 2019,The sunrises from temple statue and the view is totally worth it .. grand Hyatt also rents kite if you wish to fly kite 
Anthony H,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,"The only unenjoyable thing about doing Water Sports in Nusa Dua is negotiating the prices with the operators. There are dozens of companies lined up along the beach, one after the other, all after your business. They vast majority of them will charge you as much as they can and make the whole process very confusing. The 1st thing you need to do is research your prices. We found some great prices on the Wira Water website and we used them as a negotiating tool. The prices are less than half of what operators will try and charge you. The 2nd thing you need to know is that if you let your taxi or shuttle driver enter the car park of any business, they will get a 5% cut of whatever you spend. Tell them to park outside and send someone off to talk to the various operators until they find the right one. There were 9 people in our group. We negotiated the internet prices with a further 10% off the prices found on the internet and no additional credit card fees (usually an extra 4%). The whole group had a 15 minute jet ski, tandem parasail, banana boat and four people did the flying fish. In total Cost was 2,500,000 IDR or around $250AUD. Very reasonable! Also the operators were happy because we didn‚Äôt book it through the internet agency and therefore cut out an extra middle man. Last time we were in Bali we all wanted to go parasailing and booked through an agency in Seminyak. When we arrived at Nusa Dua they told us that it was too windy and they weren‚Äôt doing parasailing. We asked for a refund and they said they couldn‚Äôt and we had to pick another activity."
ReidHouse1984,"Vancouver, Canada",Jul 2019,Beautiful place. Our hotel offered free sunbeds and we loved just chill and get tan right on the beach.
meski4,"Victoria, Australia",Jul 2019,"A beautiful beach for rock pools at low tide and swimming and snorkelling at high tide. Warm water and fine sand. Unfortunately, there's a lot of rubbish in the water."
Shannon_Perth,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,Great little beach with chairs and lounges. Great walk along the beach and check out off resorts. The ocean is clean and sand is soft. Gets really busy as well.
Abu Wandi Samer,"Amman, Jordan",Jul 2019,"The beach is prefect balance between shades and sunny area. Nusa Dua beach¬†was very¬†clean¬†and so pretty. Beautiful clear water. You can walk for kilometres along the¬†beach, so lovely. Really nice¬†beaches¬†."
Erika V,33 contributions,Jul 2019,"Nice beach if you like big waves, go and try it, few people and clean place. Bring bananas and fruits so you can share with the monkeys that runs freely."
Natty,World,Jul 2019,We are like Nusa Dua Beach very clean here. You can walk on the with out the rock. We enjoy it. We will come back here agian.
KodoDrummer,"Yekaterinburg, Russia",Jul 2019,"We found the beach areas in front of the major hotels to be very nice, but not well-maintained everywhere. We got up early to see the amazing sunrise views. In the mid-afternoon, we had massages on the beach, but further away from the water."
Marie G,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,We enjoyed walking the beach here. We didn't go swimming.The beach was very quiet. Hotels have their sun loungers under trees on Beachfront. Also had a big swing on the beach. Lovely place to spend a few hours here. Very Relaxing.
Roger K,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,The guests at the hotels that are on the beach can retreat to these for shade but if you‚Äôre visiting forget it. It‚Äôs a nice beach but no respite from sun or wind. I don‚Äôt know if I will come back
grumpee-58,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Clean sandy beach with a few large waves, great to stroll along at night.Gets a bit crowed onshore during the day."
Gian B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,I have now been to Nusa Dua for the last 4 years. The beach is amazing. You can just walk kilometres and pop in all different places as you stroll. I always recommend a Lemon Radler - great beer. The ocean beach is great to swim in. Plenty photo opportunities.
71wendyannm,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"The beaches are nicer to swim in here, & much cooler due to the lovely breezes. The sand was nice & clean out the front of the hotel with nice sun lounges available. "
paulaustralia2018,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,Beach is nice and clean. The staff at The Westin cleaned and raked it everyday to ensure it is pristine.
Travel Ninja,5 contributions,May 2019,Most beaches are dirty and unclean at Bali And some are rocky but Mont you can‚Äôt swim in It‚Äôs nice for a walk in the evening or morning 
Jeroen B,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"Lovely beaches all around. Weather is awesome. Lots of stuff to do on the water. We did jet ski, banana boat, and there is parasailing, Jetton, and so on"
Courtney M,"Leesburg, VA",Jul 2019,Nusa Penida is surrounded by resorts with nice sand. There is an excellent jogging path to run about 5k in the mornings before it gets hot. I recommend checking out the water hole before the crowds come. There was a group of people doing their morning yoga there too. Different experiences probably depend on which resort you pick. We stayed at the St. Regis and it is very quiet and serene. This must be a hot wedding spot because there were many. Seeing the bride and groom getting their pictures taken on the beach was fun. 
Aruna K,"Navi Mumbai, India",Dec 2018,"very beautiful beach, clean and clear waters wonderful way to spend the whole day at the beach with family on vaction."
Daniel S,"Geneva, Switzerland",May 2019,Synthetic little balls everywhere and a lot of plastic washing up unfortunately.Could be better . Hotels need to do more to clean it up.
BoyoChris,"Sunderland, UK",Jun 2019,Ocean as abvoe was see through. no dirt etc. Waves were not bad in june either. 10/10 beach! we stayed at laguna.
JPadman,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Overall it is a very windy beach, rocky, heavy sand, lots of seaweed, very strong currents and the waves can hurt you even if you are an experienced swimmer."
chauhanLondon,"London, UK",Jun 2019,"We stayed at a hotel on Nusa Dua beach.Went on a 2 hour hour morning walk along the beach daily where we saw the beautiful sunrise and sunsets.It‚Äôs clean, water is warm and the perfect, idyllic place to relax "
Halil,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Jun 2019,We spent three days on the beach. Even if it is tide down period you can enjoy there with your family. I highly recommend to wear aquashoes especially for the children.
Suman Raj,"Kathmandu Valley, Nepal",Jun 2019,"Early morning with your camera, Nusa Dua beach is the perfect spotlight to be at. The water is relatively calm. There are some huts for shade to relax. We didn't stay long but compared to the nearby beaches that we encountered, it's a nice place with somber view."
Suesteve33,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019,Love Nusa Dua beach.Clean compared to many other holiday spots.The hawkers tend to leave you alone once you say no thanks.Do get sick of wedding photographers and their fAKE posing clients everywhere you look.
Wojciech I,3 contributions,Jun 2019,"Lovely, clean, safe beach. Safe to have a swim, although waves quite big. Many places to stop and have  a drink. "
Kanga70,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Excellent area for sunbathing, swimming and enjoying drinks, snacks etc from the Cafe/Bar ....  whilst this Beach area is attached to the Sofitel Hotel, it is open to the general public...."
John Y,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2019,What a wonderful discovery. White sand aquamarine ocean and not a piece of plastic in sight. A wonderful beach to spend the day.
Rachel R,4 contributions,Jun 2019,Amazing !!! Absolutely picture perfect. The water was crystal clear. Can get a little rough depending on the tide but that never stopped us going at all
Tom H,"Ubud, Indonesia",Jun 2019,Nusa Dua is a lot more relaxed than Kuta. It seems less overwhelmingly tourist trappy. Many high and medium end resort hotels.
LairdofDenny,"Denny, UK",Jun 2019,"This long and beautiful beach looks great until you walk along the area where the water reaches the land. The amount of plastic and rubbish is upsetting and spoiling what should be an accessible paradise beach. The staff maintaining the beach are fighting  a losing battle.  They do sweep and collect what they can daily but sadly the volume is overwhelming.  Not the fault of the small number of hardworking people trying their best to fight a tide of rubbish and plastic which is an international problem.  We all need to do more to stop this - I did see a tourist, a dad with two young children, each pick up at least three pieces of plastic rubbish and carry them off the beach and put them into a bin - lesson to be learned. "
Mats D,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Jun 2019,The food was of excellent quality and the staff was extremely welcoming and friendly. We really felt they made the extra effort to make sure we were satisfied (which was very much achieved). The live music and magician were especially enjoyable and made the lunch a special and memorable occasion. 
andyandrews,"Sittingbourne, UK",Jun 2019,"Most people will have access to swimming g pools.  The beach is divided into sections for Hotels.  It is fine, sandy and easily accessible but it it VERY shallow which precludes swimming. Looks nice, is clean and a pleasant place to unwind ( but not for swimming)"
Reece B,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2019,Having seen some of the other beaches around main tourist areas of Bali I find the beaches here are much more cleaner. Very relaxing and don't have people pouncing on you to buy stuff.Loved it.
wolfsbite,"Hobart, Australia",Jun 2019,This beach is nothing to rave about. It is protected by an enclosed reef over which the surf breaks making quite a picture.The sand is very coarse and soft making it hard to walk on.In the mornings a team of beach cleaners remove seaweed from the waters edge and bury it in the sand.  They also remove the countless plastic bottles that were washed up overnight and presumably send it off for recycling.A nice beach to look at but I wouldn‚Äôt swim in the water.
Andowhite,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is just beautiful..,the water is clean and clear ... the workers are constantly out cleaning all the beach front even of leaves from the trees ..  I just hope us as tourist respect the beauty enough to make sure we leave it clean "
quito2003,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"Depending on which part of the Nusa Dua beach you go to, generally there is really quite a fait bit of rubbish swept up shore. Private beaches in front of hotels or resorts would have cleaners sweeping up the garbage every day. It is reallt a pity, but it reflects the state of pollution around that area."
sallynatanegara,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jun 2019,So crowded now. I love it back in 2000s when it was still exclusive. I dont really like the Bay area full of broke closing clubs and all.
imfussy1,"Limavady, UK",Jun 2019,"An excellent hotel, immaculately clean. Staff are fantastic, so friendly and helpful. There was a huge range of breakfast dishes to choose from and facilities to avail of. This hotel has something for everyone. A very peaceful and tranquil place to stay, would love to have been there longer. "
Jason,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2019,"Huge beach lined by many premium hotels, a lot of beach areas close to the hotels are private. The ocean is fairly clean a waters are calm, although the tide is substantial. A great walking/riding path running the entire length of the beach."
khanh ly,10 contributions,Jun 2019,Beach of Bali Nusa Dua really so beautiful and nice place for couples go to travel together or family have a good holiday together! Indonesian very friendly and kind!
490billyp,"Auckland, New Zealand",May 2019,It is best to swim at high tide as the water is less than knee deep at low tide - take a hotel towel and enjoy
Harry,"Linz, Austria",Jun 2019,"Our hotel was located at this beach and we loved it. It is long, clean and offers peaceful shallow waters as well as crazy high waves!"
Katheryn F,"Gainesville, VA",Jun 2019,"This is one of the cleanest beaches that we have been to in Bali.  We always stay at the Westin Nusa Dua which has a private beach. However, all along Nusa Dua, the beach is clean and beautiful."
Battista_R_K,jakarta,Jun 2019,"Nusa Dua beach is getting more natural year by year. We can see more and more fish swimming around near the beach. Hopefully the people around also can get better by using the trash bin, especially for plastic waste."
Dawn L,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"This is a clean, beautiful beach! It has really fine sand. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt so we had access to the hotel's private beach. We love it! "
cattloverss,"Minneapolis, MN",May 2019,"The beach is very calm and not crowded, the water temperature is just right, not too cold or hot. I enjoyed swimming in the ocean very much, the beach is very clean."
AndreasHopkinsMailbox,4 contributions,Jun 2019,"Best beach in Bali in my opinion. Cristal clear water, golden sand. Not many people around you. It's perfect place to spend vacations."
Sdhawan61,Noida,Jun 2019,"This place is mainly for water sports and if this is ur first visit than u need to be careful with rates as any kind of rates and bargain will be offered. Very commercial on some activities and very nice and helpful in some. Here are some dos and dontsCarry local cash in abundance as discounts is on cash and how much u can bargain Carry ur own gopro camera and other camera  if u can for activities , they use cannon hotshot for photos Photo charges are high if used their.  services Cleanliness and hygiene is an issue in some activities like diving. Watch out for   mouth gear .Flyboat, jetski, bali ocean waker, donut ride, para sailing , diving is what we did.Donut guy was rude but staff making it do was helpful.Please be ready to bargain tickets to max based on nos of people , they can bring it down by idr 1000000 easily."
bjoliverio,"Atlanta, GA",May 2019,"We saw this beach from the Nusa Dua hotel and it was a disaster.  Maybe it was low tide but still not at all like the pictures. Or maybe it is just from this hotel.  The hotel does not clean the debris on the beach in front of their hotel either.  A lot of beaches in Indonesia are public beaches, but most hotels still cleaned the area in front of their hotel and then raked it.  Not the Nusa Dua hotel, it is a highly distressed property.  Be very careful."
Keely S,"Cookeville, TN",Aug 2018,Wonderful place to visit.  The people are so nice and friendly.  The beaches are stunning and the rooms were spacious and very clean. All services available on the property.  The tour guides were very nice and the best was Maudi. poolside service was excellent.
Saratasty,France,Jun 2019,"They say it is public but actually it is private because all the resorts are there, meaning every hotel has its private beach ! you still have the right to seat on the sand ( thanks god.. lol)  It‚Äôs beautiful but full of tourists "
111aor,"London, England, United Kingdom",Jun 2019,Visited Nusa Dua at the end of two week visit. Beach lovely and lots of sand although sand is difficult to walk on closer to the sea as you sink deeply making it hard to enter the water. Outlook beautiful with boats to watch and hotels have access to their own part of the beach. When tide goes out quite rocky with pools to look for small fish and anemones. Walk along to see the turtle nest. 
Muhamad Idris Satriyo Nugroho,"Blitar, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"The beach in the Nusa Dua area is very clean because it is surrounded by luxury resorts, every day the staff cleans leaf leaves, the security in the Nusa Dua area is also very guaranteed because it is surrounded by 24 hour CCTV, so the beach in Nusa Dua is clean, glass really for vacation / honeymoon even prewedding"
Andre Cornelius S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"I visited Novotel Beach Club, its very easy to access when you stay at Novotel, they have shuttle service every 15 minutes and they give you beach towel (free of charge).The Beach and the sea are very relaxing. Don't forget to put sun screen or tanning oil."
KJ1711,"London, UK",Jun 2019,"Huge, gorgeous, a wonderful beach to spend time on. The water is nice and shallow and perfect for children. "
DarelleNg,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"Nice beach, white sand and perfect sunrise. I walk along the beack from Sofitel to St Regis every morning."
Krishna,"Bengaluru, India",May 2019,We were there during 22 to 28 may for family vacation.Went to the beach many times. Also had a yoga class at the beach.My son had his beach massage.We also went there few times to swim and during walk/run in the morning.Great view and ambience. Shallow waters and white sand where one could spend many hours.Since we had to go out to visit  other places in bali we could not spend as much time we originally planned. 
Made Wiasta,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",May 2019,One of the oldest hotel in Nusa Dua. The location is wonderful. The beach is really clean and the room has large size!
Vin Dosa,"Hyderabad, India",May 2019,Its a beautiful beach with blue skies and lot of activities to do. One day is probably good enough to complete all the activities. We just loved it there. We had so much fun with family. There were hoards of visitors trying out various activities at the beach too.
Himawan Widyandaru,"Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Family kind of beach, the waves is not that big compared to other beaches but the sand itself is a bit coarse. A lot of high end resort but it feels nice to hang out under the sun and relax a bit. Entry fee is about 5000 rupiah which still reasonable thinking about the surrounding posh areas"
Indra,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Good place, could be for sun rise and sunset. It's quite far from home but kinda worth it. The kids love it, a great day"
Chockiechic,96 contributions,May 2019,"As we were staying at the Marriott Nusa Dua Gardens Resort, we decked out at the Marriott‚Äôs private beach area. The waves at this beach is very good for beginner surfers. Surf lessons, wake boarding, jet ski, and various sea sports activities are easily available along the beach. Little ones will have a blast at low tide - they can go crab hunting and also catch sea stars and sea slugs. There are no lack of masseuse combing the area if you fancy a massage by the beach. "
victor056,"Derby, UK",May 2019,Walked down about 15 minutes from our hotel at the quieter end of Nusa Dua. It‚Äôs a lovely beach but can be a little busy where most of the 5 star hotels are situated.
Pamela M,"North Haven, Australia",May 2019,Thoroughly enjoyed swim at the beach paid 50;000 rph for beach bed which is ok.  Enjoyed milk shake from small cafe and swam in clean ocean. Go visit
Darshan L Trivedi,21 contributions,May 2019,"Very clean beach,  clear and calm waters and perfect place to spend time with loved ones..... Not very busy as other beaches... A very good option if planning for a romantic Getaway, "
ronnieboye,4 contributions,May 2019,"Perfect!! Clean and not crowded.. crystal clear, water and beautiful hotels along the way .. well lit path way.. "
MalcH,"Loughborough, UK",Apr 2019,Nice beach that goes on for miles and good place to watch the sunrise. Sand itself was clean but quite coarse in places. Sea very clear but just be careful of currents and sea urchins when the tide is out. Mainly links the large five star hotels but small cafes/beach clubs can be found along with water sports and of course the obligatory massage ladies. 
Tdope,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",May 2019,Water is smooth and good to swimThere are sea weeds which our resort used to remove every morning.  There are people who would sell stuff and rides. negotiate and bargain. 
Phillip's Sanjay Divaker,"Secunderabad, India",May 2019,"Courteous staff..Good food....Water front...Good Dal Makani...Indian food, Amazing Sea Food restaurant IKAN"
Prakash K,"Kathmandu, Nepal",May 2019,Very good beach with clear water. But there is a problem that garbage comes to beach with waves. But people are aware there and they always do attempt to clean it. Me and my wife walked kilometers in the morning of our stay. Very good feeling. But due to cloudy weather we could not enjoyed sunrise.
rangiorachap,108 contributions,May 2019,"A real gem. Right beside the Club  Med On the beach walk, and before the beach club and Sofitel beside the marine police you have this massage place. Quite unassuming and they offer massage and hair braiding etc but remi who was our masseuse was amazing. Lovely ladies all of the. And we would highly recommend. We had 3 massages each with Remi. As good a quality as the hotel ones ."
LucioHolder1983,2 contributions,May 2019,Beautiful view and perfect sand to walk on. Our hotel was just  in few steps away and im so happy to be there. Will recommend this place for all my friends.
silki_milki,"D√ºsseldorf, Germany",May 2019,"The beach at nusa dua is really beautiful. The sea is Cristal blue and you can see right through it. Water temperature in may was great. The beaches are really tidy and clean as the hotels do take care of them and pick every waste they see. Thanks for that!The only ""negative"" thing is that you have quite intesnrive low and high tide so that the water is really low some time. As this is naturally you can't see this as a negative point. "
Nirav,"Mumbai, India",May 2019,A good beach for water activities organised by professional like scuba .. snorkeling...etc Not good for swimming
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,After being shocked at the pollution at Kuta beach we were happy to see that Nusa Dua beach was clean and in good shape. It is a wide and long beach to stroll along. The water is quite clean and refreshing to jump into. There are many hotels along the beach and also here and there some local restaurants. Nusa Dua is definitely a great area to stay in Bali and with a beach in this condition definitely better than many other parts of the island.
TLZZE,"Oakville, Canada",Apr 2019,Cleaner and nicer sand. The riptide in some areas is pretty strong so be careful with little ones or not strong swimmers.
DanaKrick,"Cape Town, South Africa",Apr 2019,Beautiful clean beach. Woke up at 5am to make it to Water Blow by sunrise... absolutely worth the early rise. 
Rumyana L,"Sofia, Bulgaria",May 2019,"The beach is very clean and well maintained. There are areas where smoking is prohibited. The sun loungers are comfortable and extremely well maintained. They are located in enough space each other and there is no sense of overcrowding. An interesting attraction is a wooden swing and a hammock, located in the ocean itself in an accessible location. At the tide of the ocean it is very interesting."
Ange Singleton,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Dec 2018,Amazing place to have dinner as a couple and also great to spend time with the kids during the day. soft clean white sand. 
AkhlassJr,"Edison, NJ",Apr 2019,"Fantastic beach. Compare to Kuta beach its just amazing how clean is it. Water is safe, no big waves or dangerous currents here. We totally satisfied."
Dina A,2 contributions,Feb 2019,"This place was amazing one, we'ere very happy and interested in everything we did.Really it was a beautiful place"
Suzie O,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,Most of Nusa Dua beaches are beautiful with white sand and clear water. Some of the hotels have 'beach cleaners' but others need to ensure they get rid of rubbish on the beach every day.
Loreta S,3 contributions,May 2019,"Beach is in very nice private location, accessible  for all tourists. Very clear water, not crowdy. Families with little children would enjoy this beach as well. Overall nice place to spend your day out in a sun."
Carol B,6 contributions,May 2019,"we went there pretty much everyday during our stay. the beach was mostly privately owned by the hotel. depending on which hotel you stay at, you will see different part of the beach. Overall, very relaxing place to spend the day."
Antony B,16 contributions,May 2019,Safe and quiet beach that allows you to discover many rock pools during low tide and walk up to the surf break
Narelle Z,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"Nusa Dua beach was very clean and so pretty. Beautiful clear water. You can walk for kilometres along the beach, so lovely."
Michael D,"Camden, Australia",May 2019,One of the nicest beaches in Bali . Beautiful white sand and clean clear water . I would recommend any beach lovers to come to this beach
RanjaniManthri,"Bangalore District, India",Apr 2019,"It was low tide period and the beach was good 4 kms away from actual beach, didnt enjoy much, It was quiet unclean as well       "
Adelene Tschuma,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,"Beach could do with a little bit of cleaning up. Rubbish all along the edge of the water and in the surrounding gardens. Sand near the resort is immaculate, but if you venture any further the condition starts to deteriorate. Placing a few rubbish bins with clear signage may help a little. Sand is a beautiful white colour and water isn‚Äôt too bad as the reef seems to clean it up a bit. Lots of water sports and activities to choose from as well. Not bad for Bali! "
Vic And Barb,"Phillipsburg, NJ",Feb 2019,Really nice beaches . Much cleaner than the beaches we normally stay at in Seminyak.  Really nice part of Bali.
Michael B,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2019,Visited the Bali Collection in Nusa Dua and paid a visit to the beach whilst there.  Beach has a nice walking path but not really the cleanest one I‚Äôve ever been too.  Nice variety of food choices along the beach with some nice kid friendly areas.  It was only a quick visit so will have to go back next time I‚Äôm there to get a better feel.
PeterOdgaard,"Aarhus, Denmark",Apr 2019,Nice well protected beach with shallow waters even if waves are high at other places at the coast. Beach all long the beach and the hotels at the shore.
Ashley M,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2019,Great place to laze around and have a few relaxing drinks with friends Easy to get to and inexpensive 
Isa B,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2019,"Love it. 360 degrees picture ready Got my phone a new wallpaper instantly Super big waves and great for surfers.Non-surfers like us, we had so much fun jumping the waves alsoSpecial thanks to the grand Hyatt Bali  team, we can see that our part of the beach is actually the cleanest!!Nice memory "
28jeanmarier,"Quinns Rocks, Australia",Apr 2019,"Beautiful stretch of coastline with plenty of beach to laze about. Hotels have kept their respective beach fronts accommodating. Water is very inviting but full of rubbish. We really weren‚Äôt keen on swimming with plastic bags, chip packets, food scraps, bottles and reed baskets. I really don‚Äôt know why anyone was keen to hire a surfboard despite the nice waves. It was a terrible sight. The Balinese would go a long way to teach people to keep the waterways clean. "
Lars B,"His, Norway",Apr 2019,"Perfect place for a calm vacation! They sweep the beach for garbage every day to keep it cleen. Good restaurants along the beach. Expensive, but worth it. Very good service! "
Susie,Philippines,Mar 2019,Perfect and staffs are very friendly and accommodating ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èthe Hotel is very clean and I remember I booked me deluxe room but they put me in premiere room surprisingly and it was very overwhelming experience.I can‚Äôt wait to stay back .
Tony V,21 contributions,May 2018,"Great place to unwind.3 Visits and we just keep getting drawn back, Nothing outstanding and not cheap like some people expect but a reliable nice place to visit ."
Joüê†,"England, UK",Apr 2019,Lovely beach. One of my favourite in Bali. Would definitely come back to this beach lovely sand and lovely water
KerroTravels,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"A nice enough beach with areas marked off for the resorts and other areas open for local families to play. There‚Äôs a long reef off shore that creates great waves for surfing. The water is generally clear, with fish and sea snakes (!) swimming about. My one disappointment was the amount of rubbish in the water. Perhaps the hotels could be encouraged to leave garbage bins at the resorts for people to put a piece or two of rubbish in and help clean up the area.  "
Dani,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Apr 2019,The Beach in front of the Mulia is gorgeous. Lovely to lie at or walk along. However at low tide there is rubbish that washes up (normally in the evening) which can be quite gross. The sand is nice but quite rough so can hurt your feet. Not as amazing at Australian beaches but still really nice! 
Ian Manborde,"Coventry, UK",Apr 2019,"A long stretch of sand with plenty to see so. Large stretches are given over to chain hotels and, whilst lawns are manicured, adjacent restaurants are steep. It's a beautiful place to visit (we did jetskis etc) but do your research first on what you are looking for."
BabyH73,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2019,"Our first couple of days here this beach was heavenly. Clean, crystal water and peaceful. However a couple of days in I was shocked and the piles and piles of rubbish on the beach and floating in the water. So disappointing. "
SriyaniT,Lincoln,Apr 2019,"The Nusa Dua Beach, is very popular. Wide sandy beach and warm sea. We were here during the full moon so it was a little rough. Very pleasant, not crowded, but very touristy."
Deena M,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,"Beautiful yellow sand. In front of Meli√° resort water calm, safe water. Short walk toother side sea rough."
Deb F,8 contributions,Apr 2019,"The beach is stunning! You can sun bake, swim, do water sports, get hair braids ...all of these are at your disposal"
Sudhir N,11 contributions,Apr 2019,Has potential to be a good beach. However plenty of weeds and rubbish strewn around by the waves. Needs regular cleaning for a better experience.
Eileen C,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,Come during low tide and you can walk a fair distance out to the sea. Great for hunting little crabs and fishes in the little pools left by the tide.
rohitpunjabi1,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,A very long beach where one can actually go for a long relaxing walk. The cleanliness of the beach is also worth a commendation. 
Nick and Angel S,"Milton Keynes, UK",Mar 2019,"The beach at Nusa Dua is an absolute stunner! I‚Äôm not a beach person, but this is one of the most beautiful beaches we‚Äôve experienced!"
David Read,46 contributions,Nov 2018,"Fantastic golden sands and deep blue water. Beach sheltered with waves breaking several hundred metres from shore. The real pity was - the water was full of rubbish :( All small plastic bits and pieces of crap, small bags, straws, sauce containers etc Others have told me its a 'seasonal' thing and most times the water is clean and clear ... its filthy in the wet season sadly :("
Christmas2010,"Atlanta, GA",Apr 2019,"The water is clear and warm, but there is a warning sign about sea urchins and jelly fish. It made me stay out of the water."
Varun G,China,Apr 2019,Happy to see blue colour of the Sea. Great to sunrise !... We enjoyed bicycling around the area as all hotels are connected through a walking / cycling path in parallel to beach.
Azee B,8 contributions,Mar 2019,Had some nice leisure time with family at nusa dua beach. The rain made it more interesting. Highly recommended for visit.
0rthopaedics,"Sligo, Ireland",Mar 2019,"had a private part of the beach as part of the hotel, but walked all along, spotless and beautiful sorry we didn't get to see the sunset!"
Neil S,"London, UK",Apr 2019,Fantastic beach great views. Used the free shuttle bus from Novetel. Loads of space nice and clean. Easy walk up to the water blow
RMK_10,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"One of the best beaches in Bali for sure.Hotels around normally keep the beach spotless most of the time by using Staff.So it's pristine golden sands beach. Lot to do swim,surf,fish,boat, paddle whatever you like all available.If you walk either side of the beach you will come across some of the most prestigious Hotels of Bali.Also, many beachside bars, restaurants to sit & watch the world go by. There was even a Cruise ship stationed not far whilst we were holidaying.Most lovely place to enjoy the fresh sea air, take in the sun & enjoy best of Bali."
SumalaiChinklang,"Pattaya, Thailand",May 2018,"Clean beach with deep blue sea, clear sky, you can lay down all day and can exited with surf activity."
Perlaky Mate,"Budapest, Hungary",Apr 2019,"Compared to some other beaches in Bali, the amount of trash in the water and on the shore is bearable. The waves can be pretty good, there are changing rooms and restaurants and the ambiance all in all is fine."
S C Mishra,43 contributions,Dec 2018,The beach is nice with good waves. Onecan take sea-bath and go for swimming.The beach is good for going for walk.The sun-rise and sun-set at the beachis worth-seeing.The arrangements‚Äãin the beach are good.
Sue M,"Williamsburg, VA",Mar 2019,"All the five star properties border Nusa Due Beach and each resort provides for their guests, loungers, beds, chairs, etc overlooking the beach.  The area is also patrolled by hotel security.  There is a great walkway, paved well for guests to walk from one resort to another, there is a public area in which folks can rent surf boards, etc.  There is a temple that one can visit from Nusa Dua Beach and of course there is the Water Blow to walk to as well.  Have plenty of water with you as it is quite hot and humid,"
MrsJulia2307,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2019,"Great place to relax after working and business trip, I have to spend over the time until sunset in this beautiful beach "
Companion530104,48 contributions,Mar 2019,"This Beach area is Quiet, easy access, great for children and for elderly. Perfect for all ages and safe. The tide is mild."
sabi0james,"Manila, Philippines",Mar 2019,"From our hotel, the Courtyard free shuttle is provided to visit their beach club in Nusa Dua beach. It seemed that surfers frequent the area. The club provides free use of loungers and umbrellas. One can just lie down and enjoy the beach,with fresh coconut juice or other drinks available for sale."
CKteckey,"Greater London, UK",Mar 2019,"One of the best beach in bali. Clean blue water with much needed privacy. Unlike Seminyak Beach, here at Nusa Dua water is clean with white sand and safe for children as well."
roger a,15 contributions,Mar 2019,"Lounger and umbrella hire very reasonable.Lovely beachSome access areas to the sea are steep, others are fine, and to the far left hand side it is ankle deep for a good 300yds and more. "
Desniar B,"Depok, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"located behind the 5stars hotel, all this beach are very nice and calm, all area well maintain with guard standby from each hotels"
Cheryl B,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,Great holiday and great to see Rosalina again at Westin Resort.  A little disappointed with the quality of afternoon tea
Wayne B,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,"The first things that struck me was how clean Nusa Dua beach was, both the sand and the water, and that it wasn‚Äôt anywhere near as crowded as the beaches at Kuta and Seminyak.There are plenty of day beds that you can hire in addition to those of the various resorts.The waves close to the shore are very minor but the depth drops quickly. It is a great place to swim or simply relax.There are good breaks for surfers but they are well off from the shore."
Jeff C,"Sandy, UT",Mar 2019,"Nusa Dua beach checked all the boxes for me.  A large, expansive, white sand beach, the water is shallow close to the beach and pleasant to soak or swim in.  Further out, surfers find waves large enough to thrill them.  The usual water activities are available and it is just a short walk from the Bali Collection.  We had a great day there."
Jakub J,"Warsaw, Poland",Sep 2018,"Great place to visit, soft sandy beach with many different amenities like bars and restaurants. Picturesque place. "
Chris L,162 contributions,Mar 2019,"Took me four trips to Bali before I journeyed here. The beach is amazing. Be prepared to pay a bit of extra money if you eat at one of the restaurants overlooking the beach. A tourist resort spot for sure, not the ‚Äúreal‚Äù local Bali at all, but manicured to the point of tropical perfection."
pretzel65,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2018,great place to swim and snorkel and there is lots of sprukers to come and bargain with to book  days   trips and get the best price. also good for a drink and something to eat
Saurabh Srivastava,"Noida, India",Mar 2019,The beach is very neat and clean with arrangement for relaxing and suntanning. Normal shower available for cleaning up. Water is blue and provides great scenic view. Great beach to enjoy leisurely walk.
Jackie T,3 contributions,Mar 2019,This has to be one of the best beaches I have visited. Stayed on Nusa Dua beach for 7 nights. Lovely golden sand. Plenty of shade provided by the trees lining the beach.
Di G,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2019,For us oldies I suggest you visit early or late afternoon as there is no shade and the sand and Sun get very hot. A must see though as it is a beautiful beach.
Travel on my mind all the time!!!,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018,This beach is too good and best in Bali for water sport. We were in group and got good discount for Sea walk activity which was a wonderful experience.
Desislava G,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Jun 2018,The beach is nice. The sand area is wide. But in general Bali should not be considered as beach destination
KrishCal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Dec 2018,Clean beach for walks and for a dip. Not much activity in terms of tourists. Some scuba diving joints nearby which can be used. 
Jo E,"York, UK",Feb 2019,"It is what it is really, just another shopping mall with mostly high end shops which must people can‚Äôt afford. There are some place which sell normal tourist nick nacks , gifts and sarongs etc.. which are reasonably priced. There are lots of restaurants dotted around but didn‚Äôt try any of them. Got 2 single scoop ice creams from baskin robins and it was nearly ¬£9.00!! A spot to have a wonder round, but nothing  to write home about. "
Robin S,100 contributions,Feb 2019,"Since we stayed at Nusa Dua Beach hotel, enjoyed the beach so much. Clean and super white sands. Lots of water sport activities available. Good even just to chill and sun tanning."
Pete3rd,"Noosa Heads, Australia",Feb 2019,"Forget Kuta, Seminyak and Canngu. If you are looking for white sandy blue water beaches Nusa Dua is it. "
Bgb091,13 contributions,Feb 2019,"Great for all ages, very clean heaps of seating under umbrellas good water sports available kids loved it everyday"
yipjcs88,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2019,"This was my second visit. Nothing much has changed at the beach, still so beautiful and tranquil. The sand is good and the view is expansive. Not many people at the beach-front but there were many tourists resting on beach-benches in the nearby waterfront hotel."
PamF47,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2018,Nice pathway goes along in front of most of the hotels and it is a very pleasant walk along the ocean front without having to walk on the sand
laurenandrich,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Feb 2019,Beautiful beach. Clean. White sand and clear blue sea. Peaceful. Perfect for watching the sunrise. Great for beach walks. 
Claudine F,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2019,"We have spent two days at the beach, both times spending a little bit of money to hire deck chairs mostly for the shade ($200,000 IDR for two chairs and towels for two hours). The water was clear and even at high tide had a nice long stretch of relatively shallow water to paddle in. Lovely white sand with very few hawkers. "
Christian H,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2019,Beautiful beach close to shopping and ample food and beverage options. Great for a swim and learner surfers but do check the tides to time your visit.
Kaylie G,Brunei Darussalam,Dec 2018,"We went here on a day trip from Sanur it was beautiful. Clean, tidy and plenty of space. This is definitely worth a visit compared to some of the other beaches, one of the beach clubs let us use the loungers and toilet facilities for free which was fab, we did buy snacks and drinks though. It was quiet with a few people so it was nice. Highly recommend this beach and we had a two and a 16 tear old."
RENEDOLANBALI,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"As Bali‚Äôs most exclusive resort area, Nusa Dua‚Äôs beaches are generally quiet and well-kept. The waters along this south-eastern coastline are calm, thanks to the long-stretching Nusa Dua reef breaking the otherwise big swells that constantly surge in from the open sea. Between the two focal ‚Äòtwin island‚Äô landmark is a bay with blue waters, a favourite spot for swimming and snorkelling"
Lynn F,"Woodvale, Australia",Feb 2019,dived into the ocean after a long bike ride and it was crystal clear and just so refreshing. There looked like some good surf around the point as well
Sachin S,12 contributions,Jan 2019,"White sand, blue-green transparent water! The only drawback is leaves and grass which very frequently sticks to your body. Definitely one of the must visit places in Bali."
Nicky_c79,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,Lovely beach.  Gentle swell.  Great for kids or inexperienced swimmers.  Not too many hawkers.  I was at the Mercure beach club (most hotels seem to have an area) Would definitely recommend getting a massage from the ladies   It was amazing.  Thank you Annie (#24) 
baliobessed,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,this beach is very clean and not many hawkers.easy to hire paddle boards and jetski‚Äôs or book a glass bottom boat or snorkeling tour.lots of restaurants along the beach front.it‚Äôs not too deep and no big waves so perfect for little kids 
Michelle M,"Bophut, Thailand",Feb 2019,This beach is basically where expensive hotels are but it is Not my preferred beach. Nice calm water and not deep. Plenty of overpriced hotel food but also local Warungs that are friendly and good too before you get on the beach.  Beautiful hotels and huge private villas..not in my budget. Much better beach is Pantai Pawada. Still happy I went. 
naughtypippy,"Marrickville, Australia",Oct 2018,been there several times beach so clean atmosphere food shops drinks pools etc very good regular over there highly recommend

tpadvs1357,1 contribution,Feb 2019,Clean beach to swiming .warm water relaxing area .fresh coconut and white sand good for your family on vacation 
SoloOver50Traveler,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,"Nusa Dua Beach is a long beach strip on which there are many hotels, resorts and beach clubs. There are some parts more suited to swimming than others but walk along the path and you will find plenty of places to swim. Most beach clubs are open to the public if you want to stop for a drink, meal or swim. I also saw a few gelato places too. If you are staying in one of the hotels they will have their own deck chairs on the beach for you to enjoy. "
coco bistro balicollection,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Feb 2019,Nice and clean beach to relax and enjoy drink .clean water to swimming during vacation .recomended this beach 
SBT676,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2019,"I did a day trip around Kuta and visited different places to find a good beach spot. Nusa Dua Beach is such a spot where you can hang out all day long and enjoy the clean beach and the waves which are a must for surfer.I found this place because of my excellent tour guide. His name is Gusti and he can be your private tour guide on Bali too.He is a very friendly Balinese tour guide who can speak different language e.g. balinese, indonese, english, japanese.I can recommend him as a reliable tour guide. He has a nice and clean van (with up to 8 seats) for travelling on Bali.You can contact him via WhatsApp (+62 818 053 620 38) and he will follow up with you.In case you would like to contact him via mail please use ngurahsuwitra1@gmail.comEven before you will arrive Bali International Airport you can contact him and he will waiting for you after you exit the airport."
TheMoni17,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,A good beach with pristine clear blue water but crowded with companies dealing in water sports creating a great mess at most of the stretch. So if you are staying in nusa dua try and stay at a property with it‚Äôs own beach. 
darrens793,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,"Its just a beach, but it is free and you dont have to climb down steps to get to it. Its clean free from rubbish, rocks and seaweed"
Amanda R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018,Fabulous beach which is the big highlight of the area! I find the area built up and unappealing overall. 
Taxi for Take off,36 contributions,Apr 2018,Plenty to see along the beach but not the cleanest. With many rocks it is not really the best swimmers beach. Water however was very clear. Some very interesting bars and small markets to see.
Conor O,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Feb 2019,"Clean and clear water, no surf, good facilities. Family of grownups loved it. Water slopes very sharply so would watch younger kids."
svvoii,"Changsha, China",Jan 2019,"Looking for ideal beach for swimming and sunbathing? Nusa Dua is the one. Perfect sand, water not deep and not really shallow. Lots of luxury resorts are located in this beach, cafes and restaurants are in abundance but rather expensive compared to other areas of Bali. There is a great shopping mall near the beach ‚ÄòBali Collection‚Äô with carefully selected items from mid-priced to expensive. The cost of deck-chair and umbrella on the beach starts from 100K. The area near the beach is very well groomed and great for photos."
clsuero,"Shanghai Region, China",Jan 2019,"This beach is very clean, easy to roam about and has friendly security and staff. Most of the hotels have an area section reserved for hotel clients, but if you walk down there is a public area and it‚Äôs just as wonderful!It is absolutely beautiful and relaxing! Very travel, family and kid friendly. Would definitely recommend!"
Daniel L,"Laguna Niguel, CA",Jan 2019,"Quiet and peaceful beach with a great view.  There are plenty of beach chairs and umbrellas along the sand for parents to lounge while the kids play in the water. While lying there, you can see jet skis, banana boats and other water activities race on the open waters and still enjoy a nice drink.  The kids had a blast in the water because the waves were minimal and the water was warm."
trvl1661,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2019,clean beach arounf with white sand nice place to relax and vacation from around the world recomended nusa dua 
Oh Sydney,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jan 2019,"Nusa Dua Beach is the answer. We stay at Bali Club Med & walk to the beach everyday. You can walk entire beach front from Club Med, to walk pass Sofitel, Westin & other hotels & no one come up to you to ask you to buy something. The views along the beach front is relaxing, hence we power-walk with Club Med‚Äôs team member 8:30am in the morning."
EduardPud,Melbourne,Jan 2019,"January - low season but to rainsWater temp 27-29 degrees Celsius Air temp 25-30 degrees CelsiusGreat amenities Beach in front of Ayodya Resort was cleaned regularly, soft waves, great amenities at the Beach Club"
jtwoodfield,"London, UK",Jan 2019,"Gorgeous breach with great views. Reef outside and what appears to be great surfing for those into that. Lots of places for a drink, nibble, or meal. Very well maintained. Plenty of security."
RELAXED000,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,Great beach for a family with kids. Lots of shade under beautiful trees if it gets to hot. The Westin (where we stayed) had awesome service for food and drinks! Can‚Äôt wait to go back! Also water sports available

It is clean, it is safe have so much to offer.Lot‚Äôs of white clean sand with a tarred walkway of many miles. Ample Restaurants along the beach  and so many places just to relax and enjoy.No vendor‚Äôs in your face all day long like the rest of the beaches in Bali.A great place for a holiday with so many good hotels on the fine stretch of white sand and blue waters.."
gazeer,"Huddersfield, UK",Dec 2018,we moved from KUta .which was Awful..to NUSA DUA beach.which was stunning..clean ..turqoiuse blue sea..fabulous hotels all along....lots of sunbeds....loved it.
ptk_from_dy,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,"The beaches of Nusa Dua are cared for by the resort staff which makes them cleaner than the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak side of Bali.  This comes at a price which is you have to pay for daybeds and the bars and restaurants cost more.  It depends on what your after - as Nusa Dua beach is definitely more relaxing, quiet and there are a number of cafes and restaurants that have good food at reasonable prices."
Larkan1234,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,Nusa Dua beach is very clean with white sandy beaches excellent for families and water sports. Very safe swimming beach
Bal L,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"Nice beach for family and kids, Calm waters, perfect for sunrise, lot of activities to do with the kids and family"
shonajoy71,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"This was our second time in Nusa Dua and we love it. It's so peaceful, friendly, lovely people, the beach has gorgeous sand and with the sound of the ocean, it's so relaxing! Can't wait for our next trip! "
Christopher Y,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2019,"Whilst I love Nusa Dua, upon my 2nd visit i had three close up encounters with creatures i was unaware existed there. The first was a blue ring octopus in the shallows not far from the blow hole. The 2nd two was at the same time in shallow water behind sofitel i saw a large long horned cow fish then turned around to sea a 60cm coral snake coming out of the grass into the peoples swim area to eat a dead crab. I had to stop young kids from playing with it. I think there should be som signs and education going on there as so many families let kids go off to explore. "
Susan E,"Lena, IL",Jan 2019,"We drove to Nusa Dua from our hotel so we could see the beaches. This is a more commercialized beach, with panhandlers wanting you to open up cards to see if you won a prize from a resort. That was annoying. The tide was out and the beach wasn't so that you could put your feet in. We found a peninsula that we could walk out to the end and see the waves crashing against the rocks. That made the trip worth it."
Yuli ca,5 contributions,Jan 2019,Recommended beach to visit in bali. Nice for family. Here i safe for swim. Clean water and beach as well
RajeevRider8833,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,"Excellent location, neat  and clean and clear white sand with blue water beach. Good for family and kids. "
Mirta,St Martin / St Maarten,Nov 2018,"The beach has shallow clear water.  Nice area with boardwalk, many resorts and restaurants on the beach. We spent the day in the area since we were staying in Kuta Beach. We were able to rent chairs and umbrellas in Nusa Dua cheaper than in Kuta. "
camiam001,"Grunthal, Canada",Jan 2019,Been to lots of beaches. This one is near the top of the list. Can get deep fast. Water merky so snorkling not great. Good chair and umbrellas for 50000rpa.
Douglas G,"Isle of Portland, UK",Jan 2019,"I entered the beach area from a pedestrian walkway from the scooter park at the Bay Bali.    When assessing the Nusa Dua beach I am Referring to the public beach at the entry points where most people seem to stay in this area (and are supposed to stay?).  I am rating the public beach sections. To your left as you come out is the more northerly section to the left, strictly speaking this is Nusa Dua beach.  It is a sand and rock beach bounded by massive, and I mean massive, walls of sandbags to protect the coast.  There is another section to your right that is more attractive and the start of the longer southerly section, which has other named beach sections.  At this end it‚Äôs ok but the ubiquitous plastic seems to gravitate to this end, so walk further south.  If you look at some maps the whole beach for the next 4km is labelled Nusa Dua beach, however a succession of hotels adopt each section of beach. So although you are not discouraged or checked you get the feeling most locals don‚Äôt penetrate to the far end of the beach which took about a 45 minutes stroll. At the end there is a long curving jetty looking up to the Monastery which is not accessible from the beach.  It gets cleaner and here are less people the further you walk up the beach. Overall a nice beach but I wouldn‚Äôt travel from Seminak again to go there, although I would say that it looks cleaner water. I also think it‚Äôs much cleaner than the beaches going up further north on the Nusa Dua peninsula which gets nearer and nearer to the port traffic and all the pollutants that go with ports.  "
christophter c,"Andover, UK",Jan 2019,This beach is a lovely clean beach staff are always there cleaning. Sea is lovely and warm but can be very shallow. 
JoAnn H,"Naperville, Illinois",Jan 2019,The beach is the reason for the Nusra Dua resorts. Access from the resorts to the safe clean beach area is the delight of beach walkers a d sun worshipers. The well lighted at night paved path to the Bali Collection shopping and restaurant area makes for delightful off sand walking. The beach selling vendors are reasonable in number and not aggressive. This is a paradise!
Dyleen26,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"The beach was not too bad, however, if you have been to other places with better beaches e.g. Redang / Maldives, this beach would not excite you too much. The view on a sunny view was pretty spectacular though."
Kevinanthea,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,This is a gorgeous place to relax and enjoy the sparkling warm ocean. It is safe to swim and everything is gorgeous.
kwtraveler,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jan 2019,"Bali isn‚Äôt an island like Boracay where you can find white sand with baby blue beaches everywhere. Nusa Dua was clean, well equipped and you can read a book quietly without anyone disturbing. If you plan to enjoy a day getting tanned and read a book, come to visit Nusa Dua instead of Kuta beach!"
spensterr,"Fort Collins, CO",Dec 2018,Beautiful beach that is absolutely spotless compared to some other beaches in Bali. Not cluttered with vendors or people trying to sell you stuff. Nice waves on the north end if your into surfing. 
Surfingfamilyadventures,Michigan,Jan 2019,We love this beach.  The water is so clear and clean.  It‚Äôs warm and has different waves for all levels.  Plenty of room for kids to play on beach and many options for food and relaxation up and down the beach.  Best beach for a family in Bali we have found. 
drolands245,"Portsmouth, United Kingdom",Jan 2019,Lovely clean beach warm water .if you are not in one of the hotels you cant use the facilities .thats the only downside but we had a lovely day there
Munster2017,"Hamburg, Germany",Jan 2019,"Nice, big beach that offers surfers and swimmers a good time likewise.We were there as a family. The water is clean and the beach is life guarded. There are some busier parts but also some quieter areas. Watersports are offered. You can rent surfboards for 200 TRup. Lots of surfers there, but close to the beach the water is calm, the surf is further out only. A lot of Aussies, Chinese, other Asians and Russians, but also Eurpeans. Good mix.Lots of big hotel resorts, but still a lot of space for everyone. Some hotels regularly clean the beach. All in all a great place to hang out on"
Tshepiso S,"Centurion, South Africa",Jan 2019,"Great beach, not as crowded kuta/seminayak beach. And plenty of water sports providers for activities to do"
Margaret.Robinson,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2018,"We caught a taxi from Jimbaran to Nusadua for only 100k ruphias and we spent the whole day in a beautiful and clean beach.We ate lical food at a local small restaurant and it was very good and cheap! ""Nasigore"" or fried rice is a must if you come to Bali as it's the traditional dish"
DirtyDewang,245 contributions,Dec 2018,"We caught a taxi from Seminyak for 150,000 IDR ($15 AUD). We wanted to see a nice beach with shops close by. This place still had lots of tourist and a huge one level shopping area called Bali collections. This place is beautiful and clean but the beautiful beachside is occupied by private resorts and their extravagant sun lounges. We were not sure if all resorts allowed outsiders to use their facility at a price but we did manage to find one that allowed us to use their facilities with the condition we had to spend $40 AUD on their food and drinks. I think it was worth it! We lazed around with music and a sun bed, chilled out. This beach is not a good place to see the sunset, however, If I do visit Bali again I will come here again, I enjoyed it."
Hanni,"Atizapan de Zaragoza, Mexico",Dec 2018,"We were here on a cloudy day. Water was fine, though not with the vibrant colors we were expecting.Lots of surfers were on the gentle waves. Water was clean and the sand nice. Our hotel had recicling chairs with their umbrellas to sit confortably and hang your towel.Not exactly the image that we dreamed of Bali, but none the less a very nice place to spend a few hours."
aditya88,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2018,"best place for water sports in bali if you are particular about the cleanliness of the water, which is clear blue! most of the beach is lined up with private resorts which have convenient access to the beach.. several cheap beach shacks and delicious food joints acrross the beach front.. a must visit beach"
Talha L,5 contributions,Dec 2018,"Calm, peaceful and NOT overcrowded. Nusa Dua beach for a refreshing break from the rat race. Great getaway!!"
Wahida S,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,The first time we went ... the tide was low ... the beach was covered with seaweed ... we were disappointed. The next time ... we made sure to come during high tide .... we were still disappointed.  Where's the beach that we saw in the pictures? Is it because it's December? Not sure of the reason.We ended up spending more time by the pool instead of the beach ... 
Hana ≈†,57 contributions,Dec 2018,"Hi, I have visited already lot of places, so far, this is one of the most beautiful beach I have seen. Recommended also for surfers, as big waves there almost all the time. Water is pure and clean, beach is regularly cleaned. You can rent a place under the umbrella, or have a coffee/lunch in many restaurants. "
Andre E,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Nusa Dua has attractive beaches. Some of which have been sectioned off by various hotels to service their guests. The beaches generally are not as crowded as Kuta and don't have anywhere near the amount of vendors offering their wares as Kuta,  Legian or Seminyak."
Ashwin D,"Johannesburg South, South Africa",Dec 2018,Very beautiful views. The beach is very clean and the water is warm. Some of the best beaches that are around compared to the rest of the world. Very scenic and stunning 
KonradVP,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,This place is a ‚Äútourist slum‚Äù!There are the paradise-like resorts of course but set one step out of it and paradise changes into a hell. The type of tourists are the young budget traveller and the ‚Äútoo-fat-to DIY tourists‚Äù. 
luvvmassiee,84 contributions,Dec 2018,"One of the most beautiful beach in Bali and with crystal clear waters too! You can swim nicely there, but the sand may be a little ‚Äúdrowning‚Äù effect for kids. Once you step into the water your legs goes in up to half your knee or more. But nice to just chill and swim, clean waters. "
Chan C,"London, UK",Dec 2018,"About an hour drive away depend on traffic. Nusa Dua is a big resort complex with many hotels, restaurants, shops, an amphitheatre, a conference centre, etc. Its open to all visitors. There are security check on the main entrance. The beach around the bays are white soft sand with calm sea and clear water. At one end of the beach, there is a new observation platform to have a good view of the bay. Also, you can watch the wave crushing the rocks and creating water sprout from this platform."
Hanna K,"Gimo, Sweden",Dec 2018,"Grest Beach, nice restaurants and close to Bali Collection. Very well cleaned and nice surroundings.But check out the low and high tide, What time it appears. "
Foodieandco,66 contributions,Dec 2018,The beach here at Nusa Dua is so serene and quite private.  You can walk for miles avoiding the crowds. A real gem amidst the hustle bustle in Bali!
Matt T,"Keilor Downs, Australia",Dec 2018,"I like Nusa Dua beach because it is not as congested as Legion or Kuta beach. You get people selling stuff, but respectful when told no politely. "
Paul N,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,"The Beach is beautiful, every morning it is groomed and looks pristine.  Great learners break at the north end.  The only disappointing thing is that by late afternoon the shoreline is littered with washed up plastic."
Ali Asgar B,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2018,this is the best place in Bali to enjoy Water Sports activities like Jet Ski and Parasailing and lots more. the beach has crystal Clear waters which is the most beautiful thing
Emile Newton,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jul 2018,"It‚Äôs a beachfront lined with hotels which is probably the reason it remains clean and well maintained , I found it rather windy and not ideal for surfing or body boarding, great for tackling some snorkeling."
Roywidjaja,51 contributions,Nov 2018,"Nusa Dua is Bali and Bali is Nusa Dua. Classy, Comfortable, Safe, location.Must visit for first timers. Family, couples, honeymooners, all will savor Nusa Dua and come back."
Diana R,"Aspen, CO",Dec 2018,"It‚Äôs not often to find the perfect horseshoe beach with inviting warm blue waters to swim in well this is it .The beach is outlined by hand end resort properties. Stayed at the Laguna Resort  & Spa , loved it!"
Andra S,"Bucharest, Romania",Dec 2018,"awesome, clear water, quite area, clean beaches - in the private area ( we stayed at  the grand private beach ) - grate bar options for food and drinks."
Marcin P:-),"Gran Canaria, Spain",Dec 2018,"Unfortunately the see polluted with plastic rubbish especially visible during waving. Even very comfortable furnitures in the beach clubs and very friendly restaurants, bar to not compensate the very bad feeling of dirty water.During the time I spend on the sun deck on the beach I saw only a few very brave people that was swimming in the water.I saw a 2 man employed to clean the beach from the rubbish, but they were not able to clean the dirty see water! The Nusa Dua authorities: kindly advise you to manage this effectively and in systemic manner ASAP!"
mo_aiguille,"Caddington, UK",Dec 2018,I loved the fact that we had the beach to own own. We stayed at Courtyard by Marriott and they had their own private beach.There are sun beds to relax and towels. Weather was perfect. Best time to go there is around the morning time until around 1-2pm. After that you get low tides and it‚Äôs not that great.I really enjoyed my time swimming about and enjoyed the swimming.You do get people trying to sell you stuff or ask if you are interested in water sports. It can get annoying at some point when you are trying to relax but I guess they need to make their money as well.
Liz M,"Hallett Cove, Australia",Nov 2018,"Loved the beach here, not too many hawkers to hassle you, water sports available on the beach and a good assortment of restaurants. "
Julie (Brisbane),"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2018,Unfortunately Nusa Dua beach has lots of plastic and rubbish in the water and on the sand. We decided not to swim at all in the water here.
Brenda C,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,"Nice beach, kept clean by the large resorts.  Not too many hawkers and are not persistent.  A foot path the water blow and beyond, great for jogging or just a stroll.  Plenty of good hotels."
GauravJulka,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,Nusa Dua beach has always been a peaceful experience for us. It‚Äôs great for stand up paddle. It‚Äôs better to go to your Hotel‚Äôs beach resort on the beach so you don‚Äôt get people selling you things.

CBM1969,"Alicante, Spain",Nov 2018,"It may not be the best beach we have been to in the world. However it is quiet, calm and clean and so much better than Jimbaran beach. "
Rajai_NJ,"Newark, NJ",Nov 2018,"Lovely walk for a romantic beach walk, the tide creates some very shallow areas that with the right angle of sunset can make very beautiful sunset photos"
ghorbelma,"Bussy St Georges, France",Feb 2018,"It is not the best beach we experienced in our life, but if you llok to quiet and calm and relatively clean beach, you have to  opt to this one (comparing to jimbaran, kuta or seminyak beaches)"
arcsabre,"Nice, France",Nov 2018,"not only tourists get disturbed by this but locals too, but just cleaning every day does not help. i mean how long do they get this it does not work like this. anyway we enjoyed a stroll before dinner at Ginger House Italian Restaurant.thanks Ramon"
Paul B,"Lincoln, UK",Nov 2018,Beautiful beach. So sad about all the plastic on it and in the sea. Beach cleaners were just burying itSo sad.
not-a-big-city-girl,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"A calm beach, not great for snorkeling but quite nice if you want to enjoy the sand and lay in the sun. The swimming is nice and the beach has a gradual decline into the ocean. We enjoyed a small picnic in the water. You could look at taking a picnic table. That could be fun for you too"
Mikesgirls5,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2018,This beach in Nusa Dua is georgous and would say it‚Äôs one of the best ones I have seen. We are in Seminyak right now and there is no comparison. It‚Äôs quite and very clean they are always cleaning the beach üèñ. Highly recommend
Barkat A,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2018,The beaches on this stretch of Bali are beautiful and clean. Most of them are private attached to the hotels. The tide can  go out a lot and when in it can be perfect surfing conditions.
tina d,18 contributions,Nov 2018,Visited Nusa dua beach in November this year. It was a piece of paradise. Beautiful Sandy beach vt not too much of crowd very nice place hv a day out.
David A,"Wellington, New Zealand",Nov 2018,Litter in water happier with pool at hotel.private beach club was nice but let down by litter in water which is all up the beach I understand this is probably as good as it gets unless you venture out to more remote places.
Bee,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2018,"Gorgeous beach, located away from the hussle and bussle of the city, it‚Äôs perfect for couples and families to lounge on. We stayed with our family of 3 and had a great time "
azrin73,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Nov 2018,"Water bit dirty wth lots of leaves and rubbish but the water is clear though, authorities do their part trying to clean the beach daily. The price u hv to pay when staying in nusa dua everything is more expensive than the rest of baliü§£ü§£"
GlendaWin,"Greater Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,This is a truly beautiful beach. We have stayed at the other busy end of Nusa Dua and not ventured into the water as there are too many water activities many the beach extremely busy and not safe to enter. The luxury end of Nusa Dua is quiet and stunning and so inviting. No comparison. 
MarkK,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2018,Easy access from all resorts the beach is quiet and great for kids. There are heaps of activity / water sport options on the beach and a variety of reasonably priced food options. All the resorts have sheltered seating on the beach and toilet facilities which aren‚Äôt policed so you can set up company where.
Bagsy30,"Rome, Italy",Nov 2018,My fianc√© and I spent 3 days at a resort on the beach! Water was lovely and hotels made big effort in cleaning beaches every day üëåüèª beautiful views 
Dileep Kumar,594 contributions,Apr 2018,Nusa dua is a very beautiful beach located in the southern part of Bali. It is center to many five star hotels and resorts facing pristine beach front. The complex is very well planned and well maintained. Most of the facilities are available close to the beach.
Sweeta S,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Nov 2018,"It ‚Äòs good beach for who like quiet and private but there are some seller who will be there to break your peace ,but still less than other beach ..that what people said ..for me I like Mengiat beach more because there are waves and sounds of beach more than Nusa Dua beach .."
flavell,England,Oct 2018,The beach is good for sun bathing but not great for a dip. ‚ÄúQuicksand‚Äù means you sink halfway up your shin before you enter the water where there are sea urchins sea snakes jellyfish and sea weed to keep you on your toes. Water shoes a must but if I was you swim in the pool.
GleanneF,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Nov 2018,Awesome clean beach. Is the best best compared to others in Bali.  Always stay in this area because of this beach.

Hassan Alqassab,"Safwa, Saudi Arabia",Nov 2018,I love Nusa Dua beach because it‚Äôs pretty quiet and relaxing place not so crowded and it have everything you need Really nice beach and yummy food and great activities I really recommend it for families and couples for honeymoon 
WhyNotTravelInStyle,"Manchester, UK",Nov 2018,"The beach looks beautiful from distance, but on the closer look it is not very clean. Also, the water is not that clean either. I found this to be a bit disappointing. "
navk922,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2018,"We had our resort right on the nusa dua beach. It is a beautiful beach with many resorts on it...nice place to relax and you can enjoy all kinds of water sports except sea walking, scuba diving and snorkeling...for these activities you need to go to nearby islands Nusa penida and Nusa lembongan..."
mr_alok,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"The beach is huge. As it is on the eastern part of the island, enjoy the sunrise while just strolling on the beach. A great experience! "

tootrue,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"This beach has it all from sandy shores, through to reef and rocks to walk on. The beach was so much cleaner than I expected. Great place to watch the world pass you by."
Niki H,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2018,"Stayed at the Westin. Nice cocoon sun beds. Plenty of shade from the trees when it gets too hot. Kept very clean by the row if resort hotels along the sea front. Good walking path mainly in the shade. A lagoon beach. Great for a swim when the tide is high. Beautiful light late afternoon and a great spot to sit and have a drink / lunch/ dinner and watch the egrets and cormorants fishing for their dinner. Can do paddle boarding or kayaking. Despite all that is available it was a pretty quiet and relaxing beach. The jewellery and sarong sellers going up and down the beach can be quite persistent the first couple of days, but once you keep saying no they stop asking. Would definitely recommend this beach"
Bobos_spm123,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2018,The beach is very peaceful and pristine white. The water is also lovely. Nice beach to relax chill out.
longstorybuthumourme,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2018,Yes coming from the Gold Coast (Aust) I perhaps have high expectations but this beach is ok by Bali (non surf) beach standards but not really worth the effort if you are used to quality beaches
Rene P,3 contributions,Oct 2018,"The personal reviews depend on where you come from and where you live there: units, houses and country I come from beautiful Nowra nsw Australia 20 Mts from beautiful beaches with real white sands I accidentally came to Bali in 2017 and with regrets I joined a Resort Bali membership so here I am again 2018 in Nusa Dua for a couple of weeks""free accommodation"" it happens after coming back from five weeks in Acapulco and Cancun Mexico no comparison what so ever with little boring Bali that everything have to be imported from Australia and Thailand food and craft I had been seven times in BBK and Phuket Island I am not the tourist that come out to the hotel stay in swimming pool all day have some drinks and then catch the airplane go back to there country I do not like how hotel and restaurants treat tourists when they re sell imported food apply services and taxes etc. Retreats "
436dimitrag,"Athens, Greece",Oct 2018,Nothing interesting.i did not like it at all.never again.just sand and sun.ugly place to swim and stay
Nimesh P,11 contributions,Oct 2018,"Beautiful white sand beaches, strong sun, and very clean. The beaches are well maintained by the resorts. Some areas have a sand bar to break the waves making the shoreline calm. There are many vendor s trying to sell trinkets which can be annoying. They don't let up and tend to hover where you are relaxing not to mention they are overpriced when you compare to other parts of Bali like Ubud. Overall a great experience though."
arnabc_iitm,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2018,A good place to spned an evening. The beach has lots of activities which one may explore. The scenic beauty of the beach is very attractive. We enjoyed the evening.
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,Sure this is a expensive area but all the hotels are first class. Great walking path along the beach front gives you direct access to the restuarant and swimming pools. Prices for food about the same as in Australia
Dr. Ayan Das,"Howrah, India",Oct 2018,"It's little drive from the kuta, we going by bike with help of Google map to reach there, once we get into the nusa Dua it's pretty confusing inside as it was surrounded by lots of private hotels and Vilas finally with the help of locals we finally reach to our destination, it's a hot sunny day and clear sky water looks lovely blue and crestal clear with very less amount of crowd. It's so peaceful and sunbeds are cheaper than other parts of Bali. It's a great time we have spent in Nusa Dua. It's must to go Experience for Travelers "
michelle t,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"We walked along the beach front, daily when we were in Bali. Most noticeable was the lack of rubbish, which has become the norm on Kuta beaches. We stayed at Club Med in Nusa and in the area in which we stayed, the large hotels had use of the beaches fronting their resorts, so they were immaculate. Non residents were invited to use the beach and amenities, couches etc, however, were restricted to the beach and could not use the pools etc in the hotel grounds.In some areas, most of which are roped off to prevent you going too far off shore for your safety, reefs were evident, and many people were snorkeling off the beach. The water was calm and clear and great for children.Warning signs are everywhere, telling people that they swim at their own risk as lifeguards are not present and jellyfish are an issue at certain times during the year, although we went snorkeling and did not see any. (We traveled in October). A few local people sell their wares along the beaches, however, they are pleasant and happy just to wish you good morning if you do not want to purchase their goods. Hotel security guards are very visual in this area which makes it very safe for everyone to partake in morning and evening activities or stop into one of the many restaurants, spas or bars which line the beach. Not as cheap as Kuta as most of the establishments are owned by hotels and resorts, but a nice place to relax. "
Nick de M,"Caernarfon, UK",Oct 2018,Each resort has their own part of the beach but it‚Äôs not been a problem for us to walk or along the beach. The beach is clean and the water is clear. There are occasional hawkers but generally I‚Äôve not noticed it to be a problem.

Cosi_Xs,"Bucharest, Romania",Feb 2018,"The beach is amazing! The sand is nice and warm even when it rains, the water is cold in the mornings and warm in the afternoon."
Bali_Mandiri_Tour,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"This beach it looks like private beach... but not at all because they have road to go to the beach for the public visitors! Very clean, white sands, safe. You can bring your own mat to relax and rest to enjoy the ocean and the beach"
Meg P,105 contributions,Oct 2018,"This is a beautiful beach, with cool lava formations and blue water. There‚Äôs no trash and lots of sandy beach. Some parts get less pretty in low tide and watch out of jellyfish. I got stung once- it was shocking but manageable and healed by the next day. "
Andres P,"Washington DC, DC",Oct 2018,"Traveled for business to Nusa Dua. I guess it is my fault since I did not do any homework ahead of time but always assumed that Bali was just like the Seychelles or Mauritius. Nothing of the sort, the beach was not impressive at all, the sand is dark, and barely a soul was bathing in the water. My assumption is that most folks in Nusa Dua stay at the hotel pools but don‚Äôt bother go to the beach since it is not pretty at all. Disappointed. "

loretta22013,"Dublin, Ireland",Sep 2018,Visited here every day and it was just so relaxing. Beautifully maintained and clean. The water was amazing...and the Vista out to sea was really beautiful. As it was attached to the nusa dua beach hotel the barman came by and took orders which was great in the heat
Ray,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"I live here in Canggu zone and when I want to go to the beach I always go to Nusa Dua, the vibe is really good and it is a really quite zone. Cool sea as well. Suggested!"
R & T,South Africa,Jul 2018,"We found these beaches really dirty and unswimmable. There were condoms, needles, and so much garbage on the beaches we were shocked. All outside the major resorts. Quite surprising and disappointed as we expected white sand and blue seas. Like the brochures.  We stayed at the pool. "
stephenmaull,"Guildford, UK",Sep 2018,If you like a walk in lovely golden sand this is the place and kept super clean . Only one thing there is constant beach sellers but ignore them then they don‚Äôt pester you 
Michael M,"Ipswich, UK",Sep 2018,"This review is specific to the beach on front of the Nusa Dua beach hotel and spa. It's a very nice, picturesque, sandy beach, with quite a lot of shade available due to the palm trees. You need to get up early if you want sun-beds that are in the shade, as people reserve them with hotel beach towels. In common with many tropical beaches, the water near the beach is a shallow lagoon, formed by the reef which is a bit further out. There is a line of buoys which separate the swimming area from the area used by small boats (some of them fast-moving), so you're not supposed to swim out to the reef. You can have a good swim only around high tide, as it's too shallow at other times. There are some beach-hawkers but they are polite and not persistent and their merchandise seems pretty good."
Lchf66,93 contributions,Sep 2018,We recently stayed at the north end of Nusa Dua and as a runner when ever we are on holiday near the water i love to run There is a great jogging track in front of the 5 star hotels all the way to the Nusa Dua Beach areaAbout 5 km long from where we were stayingIt ends around the south end of Nusa Dua beachMagnificent well kept sandy beach Great spot for a early morming run or walk very quiet to watch the sunrise and do some stretches after a run and breathe in the day before running back to your hotel for a great breakfast üòÅüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Suzie H,"Yamba, Australia",Sep 2018,Best beach in Bali. Had my morning walk and swim in the ocean it was the best start to the day. Very clean as opposed to the west coast of Bali. Just superb. 
Bernardo P,5 contributions,May 2018,"Quiet beach, very close to the hotel and with very convenient bar.But it's not that beautiful (or at least it wasn't when we visited) and it's not worthy during the low ride (afternoon for us)."
Ron G,"Gloucester, UK",Sep 2018,"The beach is beautiful, the water warm and clear, good for snorkelling. The beach comers are constantly cleaning, didn‚Äôt seem to be millions of fag butts like I‚Äôve seen on so many others. "
Brigitte P,175 contributions,Sep 2018,A great classic beach that is not too crowded and beautifully relaxed. The water Color is exceptional and the crowd laid back. A far cry from Kuta. Thank goodness. 
Sylvia DrSoul Fernandez,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Sep 2018,"I must say, the beach is very nice, and coming from Puerto Rico I was a bit disappointed... We have very nice beaches that offer accommodations for people of all budgets and everyone can come to our beaches. I think I was expecting more Sea life, very few fish and no coral in this beach. Good for some other water sports but not snorkeling or scuba. The beach chairs and umbrellas were marvelous and very comfortable! I was glad for the umbrella because I don‚Äôt use sun block and the sun here is VERY strong!! On my first day got a nice sun burn in only 2.5 hours!! If you just want a tan a some clear beach this is great! If you want marine life... keep looking! "
Intan Savitri,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"Clean beach managed by the ITDC management. we can enjoy the beach without stayed at the hotel, even we have to walk a bit far if we don‚Äôt stayed at the hotel. But it‚Äôs quite beautiful."
belean,"Uffington, UK",Sep 2018,"The stay at Nusa Dua beach came at the end of a three week trip around South East Asia so was always meant to be a relaxed part of the holiday which it was. The restaurants at the hotel are lovely and there is a reasonable selection of foods. A highlight for us was the breakfast. We would normally head out of the hotel and look for something local. Due to the location of the hotel that would have been impractical so we had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. Although the setting is very similar to other resorts we have stayed in around the world there are a number of touches that make it distinctively Balinese. A down side to the resort is that it is in an area full of gated resorts and nothing around that you can wander out and look at so you feel that you‚Äôre tied to the resort unless you want a trip out by taxi . There is a free shuttle to a shopping centre called Bali Collection but it feels like walking round a retail outlet at home. We found it good for buying any toiletries or water that you may need. All in all the resort served a purpose for us. We booked it for relaxation at the end of a trip. The staff were superb and as we found in Bali, the most polite friendliest people I‚Äôve ever met but if you want real Bali you would have to travel out or stay somewhere off the man made track. "
GoiaBella,"Paramus, NJ",Sep 2018,A small beach that you can walk out on to. Vendors come by but will not hassle you.  Being from the east coast USA I found Caribbean & Hawaiian beaches to have more appeal   Not what one dreams of when you come to Bali
Budkus,Israel,Sep 2018,The dullest beach I have ever been to. Simply looks beautiful but not a wave in sight and no depth. Great for photos and nothing more. 
TTownMike,"Vancouver, Canada",Sep 2018,"We spent the first part of our holiday in Ubud. The second half was at the Laguna in Nusa Dua (separate review- awesome place). It was our first time to Bali and we had been warned that the beaches were just ok and that we would spend more time by pools. The beach in front of our hotel couldn‚Äôt have been better. Beautiful fine sand. Water temp was 29 degrees but would warm up to mid thirties when the tide would go out. There is a reef maybe 1km our that protects the beach from large waves and large critters. The only downside was at low tide the water would go out and you couldn‚Äôt swim. Most of the day the water was high enough though. There are lots of nice hotels (albeit expensive for Bali but 1/4 the price of Hawaii. There are swimming boys marking off swimming area. The bay is about 1km long and is crescent shaped. I am an openWater swimmer so really enjoyed swimming the length of the bay. Do not swim outside the buoys though. I did and was hit by a boat (see photo of boat type) and missed the propeller by inches. Not sure how the boat didn‚Äôt see me on a calm sunny day. Ultimately I was swimming outside the buoys so my fault, but come on. Watch where your going Capt‚Äôn.Also amazing sunrises!"
ndeyapog,"Windhoek, Namibia",Aug 2018,"On my first morning at Nusa Dua I decide to check out the beach, a mere 200m from our hotel. It was not very full for someone who can be a little anti social like myself. We decided on jet skiing first, it was my first time we went to a little island just close to the sea made up of just sand. we parked, swam a bit and took a couple of shots. Next activity was sea walking. Now this was exciting, I thought they would put an oxygen mask over my head :/...all they do is put a heavy metal vacuum head helmet like thing which is heavy enough to keep you under the water and a little pipe that brings in air into the vacuum (physics came into play). we were down there walking on the sea bed and given bread to feed the fish. you have hundred of little fish nibbling away at your finger tips. its a really great yet a tit bit scary experience. PS: ALWAYS NEGOTIATE YOUR PRICES :)"
Jocelyn Y,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Sep 2018,"Nusa Dua Bali is a more private and peaceful beach, surrounding by the luxury hotel and resort, high security and pricey food around. If you are looking for this kind of environment for holiday, then it suites you, otherwise you may stay at the legian, kuta or seminyak which the location have more restaurants and shop around, reasonable price and nightlife surrounding."

stephen b,"Havant, UK",Aug 2018,"after visiting many places and islands throughout south east asia , bali beaches have to be the worst I have seen , very expensive for sunloungers to rent , the waters around the beach are not clear and inviting as you would get in Malaysia or Thailand and not as warm , local drinks are very expensive to purchase whilst on the beach, if anyone was looking at a romantic trip for a beach setting they would be in for a disappointing trip. our tip is to go to either langkawi island or the southern islands of Thailand where the beaches are better ad much warmer."
xpisa,5 contributions,Sep 2018,"Unlike Kuta which is full of rubbish and strong waves nice beach, not good for surfing, Sand very soft so is hard to walk on. Also once we got there Resort said you have to wear foot ware in water as you will cut your feet, that was never on any sites to warn us that!"
himanshu b,"Pune, India",Sep 2017,This is the best beach in Bali. Very beautiful and clean..it feels amazing to be here . One can spend whole day sitting in the beach and admire the beauty.

RG1980,Mumbai,May 2018,One of the best beaches in Bali. Very well maintained and is raked regularly. Had fun playing with my kids on the beach
sitalbahia,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2018,The low tide in early Sept is from 13:00 to 18:00 which means you have no sea for most of the afternoon
Nicho3169,"Calne, UK",Sep 2018,Got here expecting pristine white sand from all the photos that we have seen. But it is far from the kind of white sand you see in Thailand or anywhere else in the Indian Ocean. It wasn‚Äôt that clean and there are hawkers on the beach coming to pester you every two mins. We got lounge chairs for 250000 for two!! Very expensive compared to the likes of Legian. Also the tide was out I would recommend checking the tide times as if it is out there is literally no water 
Rima D,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,"Nusa dua beach is similar to an island beach.I loved looking at it and being in the temperate waters on a daily basis, "

AjitVellore,Vellore,Apr 2018,Very close to the water blow and part of Grand Hyatt. The beach is long and a relaxing walk is a must for anyone visiting the area.
Eduardo,"Dietlikon, Switzerland",Sep 2018,"The beach is OK. The sand is not thin and nice but you can, with some practice build a sand castle. :)The water is clear and clean, which you can be sure because of the amount of algae in the water, which makes it really annoying to swim. There are also a lot of stones half buried in the sand and the water is really shallow (10 meters in, 1m deep). There is the occasion plastic bag swimming but I‚Äôd not consider it dirty because of this. There are beach sellers for water sports and massages but they as you once and if you refuse they don‚Äôt bother you again. The really annoying part are the jet skis and other water sport boats going up and down the beach the whole day making noise and bringing the smell of gasoline to your nostrils the whole time. "
Jan O,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,Nusa Dua Area is an outstandingly beautiful area of superb  gardens and lawns together with many hotels and The Bali Collection of shops and restaurants.  The beach area is beautiful with interesting walks along the hotel frontages then to the parkland and blow hole.  The sea area  in front of the hotels is subject to amazing tidal ebb and flow. The Pacifica Art Gallery is in the area and well worth a visit.
Jos√© Alejandro Rey Azc√°rate,"Bogota, Colombia",Jun 2018,"We stayed at Club Med, and this beach is in walking distance form the Hotel, much nicer than the one at Club Med. Very nice to walk and see all the hotels. Its a must."

pjtrainer,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,"We visited the Novotel Nusa Dua beach club on the free Courtesy Bus from the resort and were very disappointed. The drinks were very expensive, the small allocated area was crowded with sun beds, the wind was blowing a gale, the sea was rough and no-swimming flags were in place and there was nothing else to do."
corvalley,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2018,beautiful long clean beach. Minimal sellers on the beach. Low tide allows access to shallows and sand banks

lauryte1984,"Kingston-upon-Hull, UK",Aug 2018,"We were amazed how much trash and dirt there was in the water and the beach. It was not inviting and kinda looked dangerous. The only nice part of nusa dua beach was near St. Regis luxury villas and in front of currently closed hotel, next to st. Regis."
Nancy V,"Thessaloniki, Greece",Aug 2018,"When I was planning our holidays in Bali, many users tried to persuade me to avoid Nusa Dua, because it doesn't feel local enough. I am extremely happy I did not listen to them, as Nusa Dua is awesome. The beach is great for swimming in low tide (and for surfing in high tide), the hotels are amazing and affordable, it is not as expensive as they say (for european standards it is very cheap, it is just not as cheap as Kuta or Ubud, but it is a lot nicer), it is not that crowded, you feel really safe walking outside your hotel on your own (in Ubud for example there are so many stray dogs, you feel uncomfortable), traffic is a lot better that elsewhere and you can always hire a driver for exploring (they get the same money they would get if they picked you up from Seminyak and you avoid the horrible traffic jams) and return to a beautiful place for relaxing. People who don't like Nusa Dua are the ones who haven't been there."

But one thing ....I found this beach lil dirty.... it is so crowded in the month of December and January with tourists flocking around from all over the world .

snowges,112 contributions,Aug 2018,Atrocious. Watercraft and plastic debris everywhere. No good for swimming or to laze around on the beach.
Max C,"Phillip Island, Australia",Aug 2018,"This beach is within the tourist precinct and therefore the majority of local vendors are restricted and actually carry a number, if your feel aggrieved. The beach has a large tide of several meters, and can be dangerous to those not familiar with surf at high tide. At half tide, the beach is safe, at low tide the cockle hunters go out to collect food.  Many 5 Star hotels are located on this beach. "
MoniQ,"Mornington, Australia",Aug 2018,Best of the beaches at Nusa Dua but no comparison to Australian beaches. Clean with ability to swim. 
42Chrissy,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Great place to stay except lots of rubbish in the water which is not that pretty. Not sure why the locals do not clean this up.  The colour of the water is amazing.  I would go back here again for a holiday.
Phil B,"Paris, France",Aug 2018,"You genuinely could be at any protected giant beach compound built upon a beautiful natural environment in the world here. If you were parachuted in, there would be zero clue that you are in Bali. This is a sanitised closed shop tourist fortress but its clients recline by or stroll along blue waters which carry tonnes of plastic rubbish beneath. As the waters recede its not a pretty sight. As with other beaches across Bali, the coral is hopelessly unprotected. "
David J,"Finchampstead, UK",Aug 2018,No doubt this is a beautiful expanse if sand with shallow water but also good waves so that you can do some low key surfing.Like many beaches around the world it is plagued by plastic and other rubbish being washed ashore. As there are a lot of hotels along the beach it would be great if they could use their staff to do a daily clean which would then make it a great beach
Sahar J,"Lund, Sweden",Aug 2018,"Disappointed. The beach is okey, alot of hotels and their guests here, but we will not go back. Alot more better beaches along souther part and in ulu watu. So much plastic bags, leftovers and crap along the beach so it was not nice"
Morrison S,"Pretoria, South Africa",Aug 2018,This is where you want to be if you want to relax and enjoy the sun. Generally good weather this time of the year with temperatures in the high twenties.  Jetski or snorkel or layak or whatever watersport you choose.
rickalexwestoby,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018,"Great for strolling, swimming and joying the he clear warm water. Great little cafe at the end of the beach with food and drink. Also contains all the weather sport equipment."
wesheltonj,"San Antonio, TX",Jul 2018,This is the place to enjoy the beach.  Don't waste your time else where.  Everthing you would  want is available here.
Denis R,"London, UK",Aug 2018,"Beach runs as far as the eye can see and the water is so inviting. Just a short stroll over the clean sand and you're swimming in warm, clear water. We went as a family and my 2 grandsons had a ball both on the beach and in the water. Beach is definitely NOT overcrowded and in the time we went there we saw maybe 20 people in both directions. Definitely the beach to go to for a truly relaxing time and to escape the rat race. I'll be going back."
dreamcode,17 contributions,Jul 2018,"Beautiful clean beach starting from Sofitel resort, followed by Nusa Dua beach hotel resort and as far as Melia hotel. further down to St.Regis its is very private and clear and not many people about. That is also the expensive side of the hotels including the grand Hyatt Hotel. Plenty of security through out the beach strip and very approachable guards greeting you all the time. All in all definitely a must go!"

Tassssgirl,"Tasmania, Australia",Jul 2018,There is bits of plastic in the water. Not too many people trying to sell you crap. Safe swimming for little kids.
Jamelov,"Newark-on-Trent, UK",Aug 2018,"This is a five star beach hotel. We enjoyed our stay here, but felt it lacked much of the authenticity that our other hotel in Ubud had. The beach is lovely white sand, although when the sea goes out it is a long way to walk to get deep water. It is easy to access cheap places to eat, street cafes etc- or restaurants in The Bali Collection but there is always a hard sell- especially from the beach hawkers. A lovely beach for photos. "
echo,"Lakes Entrance, Australia",Aug 2018,Beach looks clean but don't dig in the sand you will come accross all the buried rubbish. Was pretty horrible watching them dig holes and sweep all the rubbish in

Roger J,34 contributions,Jul 2018,Very clean and quiet beach..hotel staff clean certain beach areas every day. Many hotels on the beach and very expensive. You can hire beach chairs if hotel not on the beach.
Koen B,"Lommel, Belgium",Aug 2018,This is for me the second time I come here.  The first time in July.  And I‚Äôll never come back.  It‚Äôs like blankeberge in Belgium or a stupid place on the coast in sudden England.   It‚Äôs full with noisy tourists all making to much garbage in noise but also in the sand.   Nevertheless is this f.e. In October a superbe beach and nice place.
Karen D,81 contributions,Jun 2018,The beach area was lovely infant of The Mulia were I stayed. The sand was a grainy sand and quite soft when you walk in you sink a little. The visibility was amazing and next time I will bring my snorkel gear to explore the reef area a little further out. All in all the beach was lovely and I never saw any sign of rubbish. I was not at an attraction therefore I was unable to answer all questions pertaining to costs. You are able to use that section of the Nusa Due beach if staying at The Mulia Resort.
vactionerAmsterdam,"Sandringham, Australia",Jul 2018,"We stayed along this beach for a week.  We tried to go snorkelling and quickly found out that the sea was teeming with sea lice which made the experience uncomfortable, but worse, the water had a lot of debris in it....lots of plastic bags.....even this slice of paradise is polluted. Pity."
Louis B,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018,"Better than I expected, the locals are the friendliest people I‚Äôve ever meet from any where around the world , the food was exceptional and all food and drinks where great value and affordable"
Joe D,"Taupo, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"A pretty good beach spanning the length of the resorts, quite a bit of rubbish around but if you get there early enough you arrive just after they‚Äôve raked the whole thing and it looks pretty nice. A walk around the the blowhole is well recommended."
Vicky W,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,We visited this beach during our stay at nearby hotel early this year. I was shocked that lots of debris in the water. I know the pollution is a big problem in Bali and I do acknowledge there are workers do their best th clean the beach every morning. It is really a shame for otherwise a beatific place. Coming from Australia I think we take clean beach for granted . 
Chucksaddict,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018,beach was ok. safe to swim from morning until afternoon time. mostly low time around 5pm onwards. although you can still enjoy the view and just relax. 
Eungyeong J,7 contributions,Jul 2018,"Nusa Dua Beach was our main destination, but I couldn't help but be a little disappointed when I first got there. 1. Resorts. The big resorts monopolized the beach, it was hard to find a nice little restaurant or affordable sunbeds by the beach. 2. Trash. There were plastic wrappers and seaweed floating around the water here and there. You just have to swim past it.3. Suitable for swimming, not too deep, waves are not too big, white sandy beach. "
Kiamaexplorer,"Kiama, NSW Australia",Jul 2018,Beautiful to look at but ruined by pollution. We attempted to swim as it looked so inviting but kept running into floating rubbish.
Lani S,"Bogor, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"One of clean beach at Bali. With small waves and sof sand, this place situable for children to play."
Paul L,"Denmark, Australia",Jul 2018,Nicer than Kuta/ Legion area. Surf is held back back by a barrier reef. A large lagoon really. Okay for swim and bodysurf if you don't mind pulling plastic bags off yourself. A lot of water activities along this strip too so can be noisy and smell of fumes.
Sandeep57,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jun 2018,"Had the morning run at the NUSA Dua beach , it was really best experience to be part of the run. It energies you "
ketut w,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2018,This is not the first time for me to come to this place with friends. Nusa Dua beach with its white sand beaches and morning sunrise will welcome you in a very warm and peacefull surrounding. 
kymjane86,"Antrim, UK",Jun 2018,"There were a few pre-wedding photo shoots going on and I don‚Äôt think you could swim that far out however having said this it was a beautiful beach and the best thing about it was it wasn‚Äôt too busy. It was a very relaxed environment quiet and the breeze was lovely as it often felt too hot around the pool. You could eat at the beach restaurants and walk from hotel to hotel:each that join the beach ,but other than these few hotels I think it is private to people staying in these hotels (it‚Äôs not a public beach?!) There are sun loungers and there are different styles of beds even four posters but I think these belong to one of the hotels where we weren‚Äôt staying so not sure if anyone could use them. Plus I think they were mainly intended for massage. There are sellers on the beach but not many and they‚Äôre okay. It is cheap for hair braiding!! We really loved staying here. "
Simon-from-Adelaide,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Nice looking beach with plenty of sun and sun beds for hire but water can be rough and a little dangerous, and is very polluted with plastic and general rubbish. "
Megan M,"Edgecliff, Australia",Jul 2018,Aussies will find this beach and water clean and lovely! There is a blowhole half way down which is good too. 
MrsRebeccaDC,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2018,Lovely clean beach with minimal current compared with the sea on the west side of Bali. Lovely yellow sand and nice views of Mount Agung and Nusa Penida on a clear day 
Alok Nahata,"Alor Setar, Malaysia",Sep 2017,This is the beach which offers you a great atmosphere with natural beauty at its best. Good for swimming...
Naufal J,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Specially for sunrise view, this is the best place to enjoy the nature. Clean and nice place to outdoor activity, but the main gate is small because lot of hotels are stand by side this beach."
Danny S,Jakarta,Jul 2018,"We always enjoy swimming in Nusa Dua beach, the water is relatively calm and the crowds are mostly family type."
Kamara,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018,"Want a beach that‚Äôs not crowded and over run by hawkers then the Nusa Dua beach is for you. Take a lovely stroll down the walkway or on the beach itself. There are some nice spots to stop and take some photos especially at sunset.Everyone can enjoy this beach couples, singles or families of any age or size.Check it out as we forget how important it is to get into nature and see this beautiful world of ours."
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2018,"This is a long stretch of beach fronting hotels. Great for morning and evening walks with paved walkways which are also good for cycling. The sea here is good for a dip with moderate surf for beginner surfers. The beach is clean but the sea is not that clean with plastic waste floating in some places. Lots of activities on the beach with hawkers selling innovative looking kites, sea activities and food stalls. Lovely views, sea breeze and lots of sun loungers to relax and tan."
Peter74norman,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2018,"The part of the beach I visited were littered with garbage, but it is different every day but it looked like this for two days. Otherwise a quite crowded upper part where the hotels have taken parts of the beach for them selves. "
Kelz,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2018,It‚Äôs a whole stretch with different hotels but you can walk through allIt‚Äôs a beach. You have guys there hawking water sport activities like paddle boarding and the like so you can do that. Lots of restaurants too. It‚Äôs good. Just not white sands
Tony D,"Hobart, Australia",Jul 2018,Great area being surrounded by a reef it made it relatively calm to swim in the designated areas without worrying about being pounded by waves or carried away by a rip.
Arnd T,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2018,Excellent beach with excellent security and large variety of hotels and restaurants shops and beach side sun beds.
Tripti T,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Jul 2018,It is an quite beach with beautiful horizons. For a long distance less depth in water. Greenish near shore and blue faraway. Lot of people talking bath. There is a beautiful campus on a narrow part of the island. 
Andrei N,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"Having been to many different beaches I would say that Nusa Dua beach is nice and pleasant to stay at. The tides there are pretty dramatic and water can go away virtually completely. The sand is a bit too soft, sinking. Overall, however, it is a good beach with excellent facilities provided by top notch resorts."
Walter Ash,271 contributions,Jul 2018,"I‚Äôm reporting on the strip of beach from the Nusa Dua Hotel up to the Melia near the Bali Collection. No waves at all for this stretch but they can be seen some distance out as they hit the reef, so the sea is fairly gentle with a strong ‚Äòcurrent‚Äô right to left as you look at it. There are buoys fairly close to shore and guests are asked to swim within those boundaries and warned of sea urchins at low tide. The sand is constantly raked to dispose of the seaweed as it covers the sea bed up to the reef and beach cleaners are in evidence. There are ‚Äòlicenced‚Äô vendors in blue polo shirts all numbered, selling: watches/ water sports/ handbags/ sarongs etc, but well behaved and leave you alone. There is a pathway all the way along with good beachside restaurants owned by the hotels and they are friendly and seem to be good quality. There is a massive building project on the go which is a shame but I dare say when finished it will be great, that is past the Melia and the little ‚Äòisland‚Äô.Paddle boarding and kayaking is ideal and there is the obligatory jet ski which zoom past but they take the paying guests further down past the Nusa Dua beach hotel to play."
Ajinkya,"Varca, India",Jul 2018,"Well nusa dua is very clean beach with blue water with some good set of restaurants around , however the beauty of this beach is limited only to water sports. Been here to do some water sports activities , found them quite expensive and average. Wanted to take a dip inside the ocean but ocean was full with all sort of activities. Always crowded with group of people trying to enjoy sports activities and gets very loud."
annmW9739DW,"Griffith, Australia",Jul 2018,A beautiful beach always a lovely cool breeze .  This was part of our holiday at Grand Hyatt.   Loved every minute.Not over crowded..lots of banana lounges and no charge.
Vickster,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jun 2018,Only here for the day. Hired a couple of sun loungers and had a nice relaxing afternoon on the beach. The waves were  very dumpy on the day which made swimming difficult. We saw a few people get bowled by the waves and one lady carried out by the lifeguards. The walk along the boardwalk was nice and the beach in front of the huge resorts was very quiet.
Orminge,"Saltsjo-Boo, Sweden",Jun 2018,We loved the beach but beware of big waves and currents. The bech walk is long and really nice to walk on.
MarkwYorkshire,"Bedale, UK",Apr 2018,"We went at the end of April to this beach whilst staying at The Laguna.  The beach is really nice lovely sand nice setting and not too busy.  It is tidal so the tide goes out but then this allows you to explore and see some fantastic things amongst the rocks and cave.  If during low tide you want to swim pop back to the pool.Early in the morning there is some seaweed but this is very quickly cleaned up, but we have really got to remember this is a real Beach!Overall a great beach "
Jacqui‚Äôs Journeys üåè,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Nice and relaxing - beautiful white and sandy and peaceful! Mainly western resorts around.The waves break far out on the reef- nice for a change!
Andy C,"Grantham, England, United Kingdom",Jul 2018,We live in WA so usually when we get a beach holiday elsewhere we can be disappointed. Not this time. The scene is reminiscent of an advert for Bounty chocolate. Lots to do as well. Paradise
NicciBonfanti,"Epsom, UK",Jul 2018,Lots of big hotels and plenty of lovely places to eat and drink here.The tide was low when we were there so more for paddling than swimming.They can organise water sports for you there but this was a more serene place for sunbathing. Saw it set up for a wedding too and looked beautiful.Nice to spend relaxing time there. 
Michelle M,5 contributions,Jul 2018,Spent an arvo on a lounge with drink in hand watching the kites. No one hassled us at all and was just how a beach on holidays should be.
emrezz,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Jul 2018,ƒ∞t was quite nice beach. The beach was good but the sea not like thay. The sea is very short you cant swim you should walk
patrick n,44 contributions,Jun 2018,Best to swim Eastern side of beach near Hyatt. 2 beaches to chose from - separated by a headland with spectacular blow hole. Well worth a visit. 
Anton M,"Barwon Heads, Australia",Jun 2018,"Great eateries and shopping that offers a wide range of dining options Conveniently located adjacent to many of Nusa Dua major resorts Offers convenient shopping with many other services such as spas and massages, Haircare and supermarkets "
pr0udmum,melbourne,Jul 2018,We loved Nusa Dua beach it was so clean and beautiful not many people selling things which was nice and overall loved it kids could swim with the net being there felt safer 
Jasmina J,"Vancouver, Canada",Jun 2018,"We stayed in Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua for few days. The beach in front the hotel is been cleaned each morning and is very clean. We loved that the lush trees were on the beach instead of umbrellas to give you shade. It just felt so natural and beautiful. You don‚Äôt see many people swimming as the tide is low , it comes up to knee level and when the tide is high maybe to waist level. It is the only beach we found in Bali that would be considered children safe. Waterblow was near by, 5 minutes walk and I would recommend an early morning walk to see the sunrise.Most beaches in Bali have bigger waves and are not suitable for swimming. You will see many people just playing in the shallow water or jumping the waves. Most beaches are suitable for surfing. A bit disappointing. "
Dave M,38 contributions,Jul 2018,"Not the best beach but not terrible.Only good when high tide, not a nice beach at low tide.Walked from end to the other to check out other areas.Outside larger resorts was kept reasonably clean otherwise could be littered with rubbish in other spots.Reasonably busy but nothing unexpected given how many resorts back on to it.Some basic water sports options if you are staying at one of the resorts (paddle boards, kayaks etc)First time to Bali, prefer Thailand beaches to these water is also warmer than what we experienced in Bali "
rosihan t,"Batam, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Nice beach in Bali,very clean the beach,so clear the sea water you can see the sand until deep water,nice place for take photo"
Yenfnd,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"Mornings were better due to high tide and less rocks in the sand. Lots of seaweeds on the beach though, so the beach didn‚Äôt look too clean. Still a fun place for water activities. Not as crowded as other popular beaches. "
pebbleskip,"Flowery Branch, GA",May 2018,"The beach was clean and had a lot of chairs/lounges to relax in.  It's a destination wedding venue and we saw brides and grooms everyday!  They had set up a flower arbor and it was kind of fun to watch the photography from a distance.  We also watched some locals fishing way out in the water wearing traditional fishing clothing and conical hats. Never saw them catching anything but it added to the scenery!  There is a nice walkway out to the water where you can watch the sunrise.  It is worth getting up one morning (at least) and walking out to photograph!  If you don't make it out of bed in time, I'm posting a photo for you to photoshop yourself into.  It's very lovely!"
Globetrotter08uk,"Cleethorpes, UK",Jul 2018,"This is a nice pale, sandy beach in Bali.  We visited whilst out for a meal.  Lots of boats out in the water and not too many flies or mosquitoes as it was dark. Would recommend. "
griffon_remy,79 contributions,Jul 2018,"Surprisingly nice with the resorts planting a row of beautiful palms and large leaf plants at the top. Tides are huge and can leave the reed exposed during low tide, in some cases the ugly wave break is exposed in front of Sofitel. A public walkway located at the top of the beach and is well built, serving walkers, bikers and as a valid connection in between hotels.There are little bars and freelance masseuses at the ends of the beach in between the big hotels, not as cheap as Kuta but ok.In July dry season the breeze blows consistent off the see and is refreshing and welcome."
ScottinSingapore,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2018,watch out for critters lurking in sand at low tide or wear sandals! great space though sometimes a bit windy
Robert-Jan1972,"Brussels, Belgium",Jun 2018,Before our recent visit to Bali we read a lot about dirty beaches. Well the beaches from Nusa Dua are simply breathtaking and beautiful. We walked along a few hotels and all beaches were clean. No worries and have a great stay. 
Ritesh_wanderer,Delhi,Jun 2018,"One of the few beaches, where you get natural waves big enough for surfing.Need to be careful though as there are no life guards and the waves can be deceptive"
Susanne Q,"Salzburg, Austria",Jun 2018,"The Nusa Dua Beach is a big and clean beach arround the great Hotels in Nusa Dua. Unfortunately, when it rains, the sea flushes garbage to the beach. The garbage in hole is generally a big Problem. The Hotel staffs are effort to clean the beach as it is possible."
draganjulie,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean, quiet and private location. There is a variety of water sports to do. Its a great spot to relax in the sun."
turnzey555,"Research, Australia",Jun 2018,Would advise wearing water shoes as witnessed a lady in pain from having stood on a sea urchin.  The beach was ok but I wouldn't rave about it. 
TravelingLadyMoon,"Victoria, Canada",Jun 2018,"We spent 3 weeks in Bali and more than one week in Nusa Dua. The best part of beach can be found next to Ayodya Hotel. They have public entrance and you can rent towel over there. Beach area is daily maintained included a toilet, shower and beach bar facilities. Yes, it is not California beach but the best what you can found over there. Enjoy!"
Rui G,16 contributions,Jun 2018,"Cloud be awesome. Except for the trash.Good transparency Great temperature Nice sandBut... trash. I had to walk a while to find a nice area and enjoy the amazing sea.In front of my hotel, was difficult"
Jenny Z,"Hong Kong, null, Hong Kong",Jun 2018,"It is a big public beach with a long stretch. Some nice resorts along it but none actually owns any parts of it. The beach is quite dirty, and so is the water, with plastics and disgusting rubbish everywhere. Since the beach is public, no one is accountable for the cleaning of the beach. I won't come back to this one for sure. "
lizzy5California,california,Jun 2018,"The sand was ok. Indonesian is a populous country, so there is a lot of detritus in the sea. They had beach cleaners doing there best, but compared to Hawaii, or the Caribbean, its not that inviting so swim in. OK for sunbathing."
George_mile,20 contributions,Jun 2018,"We are lucky, Today i Went to this place to refresh my mind luckly we got extra placeIt is Nusa Dua Light FestivalIt was amazing for usNusa Dua is very recommended place for holiday."
Kim V,"Mission Viejo, CA",Jun 2018,Playa Del Carman is far more beautiful.  As is the Napoli coast in Kauai.  But the jet skiing and parasailing is ridiculously cheap.  Great place to stay for a brief down time after a long flight to Bali.  But then go to Ubud.  That‚Äôs where it‚Äôs authentic.   
Worldwatcher,"Toronto, Canada",Jun 2018,"Miles of white sandy beach alongside crystal clear blue water.  Direct access from our hotel, St. Regis, made this wonderful beach easily assessable."
Vicente Antonio P,"Quezon City, Philippines",Jun 2018,It was a bit windy but generally nice. It had plastics around the beach and some seaweeds. There were alot of people in the area. The showers were turned off adter 5 pm... 
962reneee,"Boksburg, South Africa",Jun 2018,"Clean, comfortable and relaxing beach equiped with an recliner and small table for your food. Stall on the beach to order your food with its bar to order drinks and another stall for beach clothing purchases right there on beach."
nutnbolt,featherstone,Jun 2018,"Very clean with lots to do, able to have a good walk along with no issues. Best time for me to go is early in the morning the sun rise is great with no one trying to sell you anything  "
sarf M,"Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2018,This is the most common place for people visiting BALI and looking to go for beach activities and water sports. Not quite far from the airport and offers most of the major activities. It has a Turtle Island visit which we took as we were with kids. Here you can hold sea turtles and get up close with them. It is a very beach so if you are looking to relax and quiet then not the place to be
Freestuns,MelbAustralia,May 2018,Bali beachs arnt the cleanest in the world. The resorts make some effyto clean up 5heir own beaches with teams of men with rakes but there is so much in the water constantly coming in that when you do go for a swim you will end up with some plastic bag or other rubbish on you. My husband collected a bag of rubbish every day we went to the beach. There were many offering bamboo baskets on the beach everyday that are just left there. 
Missy073,Singapore,Jun 2018,Low tide when we were there but overall nice beach. You can check out the dining option at the bay and the beach club
Seaside69022,15 contributions,Jun 2018,We stayed at the Laguna resort and the beach directly outside the hotel was very well kept all day long. Nice sun lounges and a beautiful view. 
vsi0351,"Luzon, Philippines",May 2018,"Went to see the temple. Unfortunately, it is off - limit to the public. However, at the beach you see a fabulous rock formation. The location is very good for relaxing. Also has nice view for sunset. A very calming place."
Girodeitaliano,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018,It‚Äôs the beach with white sandy beach and the wave is average not too crazy so we still can swim and play in the hotel. Bot to crowded beach and there are some luxury hotel located in this beach area
Dominique M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2018,"Large swathes of sandy beaches which are largely carved up by the various resorts which to larger or smaller extents have staked a claim for the portion of beach in front of their resort. Access permitted to these beaches is controlled by the resort to various degrees. You are free, however, to stroll along the pathway between the resorts and the beaches should you wish. The beaches themselves are well maintained with a plethora of sun lounges and cabanas on or close to the beaches."
anniethomson394,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Bar far the best beach in Bali. Contained in a gated community, it is unlike any where else in Bali. Very clean and very well kept with manicured gardens."
ami k,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2018,"This was our first trip to Bali.. I had an apprehension that it will be jam-packed with tourists with no place to breath!The Nusa Dua beach turned out to be fantastic! Absolutely clean, family oriented, not at all crowded and very well maintained by all the resorts nearby.Magically serene...."
Taegan B,43 contributions,Jun 2018,"The beach is clean, plenty of beach chairs- watersports. not massive waves. we had a lovely time at the beach during our week long stay"
handinixx,"Prague, Czech Republic",Mar 2018,A calm and nice beach that is cleaned every day and well taken care of which is very important when traveling to Bali because of the plastic nightmare on most beaches :(
EP L,11 contributions,Jun 2018,Both sand and shore are hard to walk/swim as they are very rocky and hurt your feet. I personally liked Seminyak beaches more. 
praveena356,3 contributions,May 2018,"As i have visited many countries along with beaches, in which i loved the most was mauritius but in comparison with it nisa dua beach along to my sofitel resorts in bali at nusa dua are also very neat and clean ...and the shores and silence of sand make our trip more awesome "
Vicky G,"Shrewsbury, UK",Nov 2017,"We walked along the sea front several times in a 12 days there. Absolutely beautiful! The water was lovely, i do recommend people wear shoes of some sort as the sand doea get pretty hot by midday. There is lots to explore and see. Amazing restaurant all along the beach front. Local venders selling locally made items, cheaper than the shops. You may even come across a few activities specialists offering snorkeling, boat hire, wind surfing and so much more. I absolutely loved while i was just sitting waist deep in the water that i could see hundreds of little fish. It was amazing! "
Rui De Sousa,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Maybe one of the best beach in Nusa Dua or in Bali facing Southeast. It's quite long, not very crowded and the sand it's clean thanks to most of the staff from the hotel resorts. Seen some plastic in the water but not as many as in some other places close by. Will come back!!!"
Patrick P,"Woodstock, UK",Jun 2018,Open clean and very cool beach. Beach outside Grand Hyatt is very picturesque. Well worth a visit. A nice change from sitting beside a boring hot swimming pool.
Mary Anne G,"Caloundra, Australia",Sep 2017,The current in May change this beach into a bit of a garbage dump with plastics and garbage washing up from who knows where. The staff at the resorts rake the sands but the water is still a bit iffy.just what happens in May
Food and Travel Gallery,"Greater Noida, India",Feb 2018,I have visited there in Feb 2018. I had stayed in Nusa Dua for 2Nights at Grand Hyatt. I had a direct access to the beach from my resort. The beach was clean and safe to walk around. The sand was little brownish in colour and clean. The view was amazing with low tides. It is far better than Kuta Beach. The place is so clam and excellent for relaxation. The place was having less crowd. Due to less crowd the beach may be boring for some people. Must visit beach.
srivelm19,"Chennai (Madras), India",Mar 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is very good for water sports activities. . U get all kinds of watersports ranging from sea walking, scuba diving, parasailing, jet sking etc. .if u are visiting from other countries book online for packages and go for cheaper prices. . At location they are very costly. . They accept indonesian rupiah as well as US dollars. ."
sandrenal,"Carrum, Australia",Jun 2018,Stunning beach! Beautiful and clean and each resort does a sweep daily to help keep it maintained. We had a great time. 
Dipteshrao,"Nadiad, India",Jun 2018,"One of the best beach in Bali beautiful beach and white sand make it more attractive. I advise to visit this place once, you love it!"
jimsrao7,"Ahmedabad, India",Jun 2018,"been there with my family, it is really good beach having clear blue water and nice view, had a bar around nice to spend 2-3 hours with family..."
LatchezarL,"Sofia, Bulgaria",May 2018,"Nusa Dua is a vast and long beach, so quiet and beautiful, BUT the water in the ocean is full of plastics, papers and rubbish. What a pity, we used the swimming pool only because of the water pollution. Local say that the wastes are coming from the neighboring island Lombock. Whatever is the reason it is an unpleasant fact and significantly will repel the tourists."
Angnmig,"Denmark, Australia",May 2018,The beach in front of the resorts is mostly very nice however rubbish continues to be washed ashore by the ocean. This requires ongoing maintenance and unfortunately most tourists do not assist. If everyone was to pick up a piece of rubbish every time they walk on the beach then the problem would be solved until the government and the resorts take further action on minimizing plastic use and educating the locals and tourists about the proper disposing of waste.
mei2000ca,"Toronto, Canada",May 2018,"You will find it is so enjoyable to be on the fine sandy beach and it is so gentle and smooth that you will almost forget how far you have walked, very pretty."
bigvicSydney,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,There may be parts of this beach where you can swim. But the huge areas near our Ritz-Carlton hotel certainly aren‚Äôt suitable. The tide goes out so far that in the mornings the swimming area starts a long way away and in the afternoon it‚Äôs too shallow for too far. 
Reuben S,5 contributions,May 2018,Lovely sand and not too many touts. I suppose the price paid for the hotel chains located along nusa Dua goes toward the mintainence of the beach including the litter management. A great beach for young children.
LUX ESCAPES üåè üì∏,"Perth, Australia",May 2018,Great for a walk or evening stroll. You can walk right along the beach and past all the resorts and hotels. Snorkeling and swimming is good around here and surfboard hire and watersports can be arranged on the beach.
Cheryl L,53 contributions,Apr 2018,"Without a lot in the way of foliage, this beach is hot. It is very clean, however with gentle waves but don't expect to walk anywhere to see other properties...we were at a large resort property (Mulia) which owned the beach area for a good distance."
Donna H,"Market Deeping, UK",May 2018,"Beautiful beach, local workers try to keep clean but unfortunately plastic does come in via the sea. Very quiet when we visited, the sellers were respectful and didn‚Äôt hassle you. The beach is sand, wide and very long, just gorgeous. Jet skis, etc for hire. Had the most fabulous massage on beach, haggle well! üíï"
Phil Matthews,"Southampton, UK",May 2018,Lovely beach but tide goes out very fast after 1pm. Lots of beach hawkers always trying to sell you tat but always polite when you refuse 
barbaramowbray,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2018,We visited the beach everyday on our 4 day stay.The beach was clean and you were not hassled.Just be careful as currents were very strong.
isletripper,"New York City, NY",May 2018,It was ok but the boats and jet skis kept interrupting where we were lounging. When low tide happens it becomes too shallow and you kinda get stuck with seaweed portions. Overall it was a relaxing beach. 
travelalot28,"Huonville, Australia",May 2018,"The beach looks very nice but is not suitable for swimming ,tides goes way out , nice to walk through"
NafeeTA,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",May 2018,"This beach has probably the best teal water on the island, offering stunning views and also has a cycling road that allows you to take a ride around the place while not only enjoying the breeze but also getting to see the whole scenic place in a short time."
rich b,"Birmingham, UK",May 2018,"Just stunning , beautiful sands clear safe waters and friendly staffFronted by various high grade hotels so immaculately clean "
satya p,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2017,clear blue waters and relatively less crowded beach. Nusa Dua is better than other more touristy beaches of Bali
Gurjit A,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2018,"We have visited once before and this time round we fully enjoyed the beach. Beautiful soft sands, shallow waters, although the waves do crash down further out. It‚Äôs amazing to watch! "
khalil R,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,"One of the cleanest beaches in Bali calm , golden sands and crystal water Most of the hotels at nusa dua has their private beaches But still you can access even if you are not hotel guest "
Hammy59,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,Long beach gently shelving into the sea which is much calmer on this east side of the island. Sand is fairly coarse but good for walking on. Catch the sunrise early in the morning or take a long walk about 6pm when it gets cooler. Plenty of eating choices in the string of hotels that go along the length
B6629MFannb,"Perth, Australia",May 2018,"You can enjoy the day under the trees on a sunbed and the breeze off the ocean is very pleasant, waiters will serve on you so no need to move!"
H9794HCmarkp,32 contributions,May 2018,Very clean spectacular beach. Safe for swimming with a gentle shelf and small waves. There are places to eat along the beach although most hotels have their own area with sun beds amongst the trees. 
DAVID H,"Falmouth, UK",May 2018,"Our hotel fronted onto this section of nusa dua beach with lots of other 5 star resorts also fronting this stretch in between the large statue and the pier. Either side is different - one side was dominated by water sports and had quite a few lots of floating rubbish in the sea, the other side (Bali beach) was a lot quieter with a few bars and places to eat - all in all three stretches of beach that differed quite a lot"
O J,"Vancouver, Canada",May 2018,"Nice surprise - beautiful beach that is not crowded, beach was clean as hotels hire staff to clean the beaches.  White sand, clear water and no buskers."
Mandy C,"Vale of Glamorgan, UK",Mar 2018,This beach came directly off our pool area. Its a lovely safe beach - spotlessly clean - and lots of water sports available.
Swede1979,"Malm√∂, Sweden",Nov 2017,We hired a driver to go to Nusa Dua Beach for a couple of hours. Not a very secluded beach but still nice with white sand and sun chairs and food for a fair cost.
eliwalgra,"Medford, NJ",May 2018,The best thing about the Hilton resort Nusa Dua was the beach!  Absolutely beautiful!  And also the wild monkeys on the property.
Tony L,"Auckland, New Zealand",May 2018,Visited the beach and felt very safe and the walk to the blow holes was out of this worldGreat places to eat and drinkLots of security but very friendly 
Wei Bing L,"Ipoh, Malaysia",May 2018,We stayed at the Club Med Bali resort in Nusa Dua and walked along the beach past a number of resorts and hotels lining the beach to the south of Club Med. We found the beach here to be cleaner and less crowded than Kuta beach.
Bonans,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2018,"Chain of luxury hotels along the beach, but open for public as well,there is an area where you can borrow beach sun lounger and chairs for a minimum fee. But beware if you‚Äôre ordering refreshments because as per my experience they tend to overprice on your bill to get some kickback. Good for water sports.The waves were high and strong when I went there so I didn‚Äôt enjoy swimming that much but maybe it was good for surfing and other activities. "
Melissa,"Tappen, Canada",May 2018,Very beautiful place. One of the cleaner beaches in Bali. I stayed at a resort just down from a public area and it was so beautiful. Strong current in that area I don‚Äôt know if I would think to swim there. 
ntguy,"Brossard, Canada",May 2018,"Nice and long beach stretching some kilometers. Two dozens resort hotel are located on this beach with many more on the interior. We are in May and the wind blowing strong causing big waves crashing on the beach. Do not expect this beach to be like the one in the Caribean. Like anywhere, there are some ambulant vendors selling stuffs but they all belong ti a local coop and with not bother you at all. On the beach restaurants of hotels sells tasty food."
Micheltravel,Netherlands,May 2018,"The reason this beach is thought of the best by a lot of people is the strip of luxury hotels that are situated here. The other beaches on the peninsula, like Queen beach at Jimbaran, Pandawa beach in the South and probably the other in the West is that a lot of the luxury hotels are here. Good choice, but if you just want to sit at the beach and dive into the waves, the others are to me equally good, they are just lacking the luxury. See other reviews too.Easy to reach from Jimbaran or Kuta, just rent a motorbike and drive along the by pass. Can't miss."
Merv17,"Noosaville, Australia",May 2018,Beautiful beach as compare to most beaches at Bali. We stayed at the Westin Resort at Nusa Dua. Which front the beach with other resorts. Found beach to be clean and protected. Good spot for young kids as the water depth is shallow. Water is mostly clear. Not a good place to snorkel as there is not much to look at except for sea grass. Nice anywayüëç
Mira P,2 contributions,May 2018,"not only the beautiful beach, it is also a great place to jog! I regularly go there for jogging and it is absolutely fun."
nadia h,"London, UK",May 2018,Beautiful beach. Wi would compare to Seychelles and Maldives where I have also been but for fraction of price
leeannekaren,99 contributions,May 2018,"Pretty beach, not too much pollution. Selected hotels have cleared the rubbish out the front. Very windy this time of year, which is lovely for the breeze but you don‚Äôt get the crystal clear calm photos you see in the pictures. Had a massage in the middle of the day, surprisingly didn‚Äôt drown in sweat. "
lisahx18,"New York City, NY",Apr 2018,"The beach seems clean at first sight, but after you get into the water, you can see garbage in the ocean. I was a little bit disappointed because I traveled very far to visit this place. There were many cleaner and nicer beaches in the Caribbean (Coki each in St..thomas, Virgin Gorda in Tortola, Little Bay in St. Marteen) or in Hawaii( Lanikai, Hanauma Bay) or in Bermuda (Horseshoe Bay). In order to keep the beach clean, everyone should take their garbage with them ir throw it in the garbage bins. Also, Bali should place garbage bins in the area.  I don't recall any garbage bin in the area.  The Bali government should implement some programs to clean the garbage in the ocean, in long term, people might stop visiting this place due to the amount of garbages. "
Regina M,53 contributions,Jun 2017,"We enjoyed Nusa Dua beach at Hilton Hotel Nusa Dua, it was breathtaking. The sound of wave could put us to sleep as we lay down on the beach. It is relaxing and peaceful. The beach is clean with white sands."
Lerdy,49 contributions,May 2018,The pristine white sand in front of the Laguna welcomes you to have breakfast lunch or dinner or even happy hour right there on or next to the sand 
Abbas Shabbir Marvi,"Karachi, Pakistan",Jan 2018,Whitish brownish sand beach. Very clean & perfect spot to spend your honeymoon. It is not crowded & very clean. Use to love sipping coconut water & enjoy the sea & view. Simply wow
Slgreened,2 contributions,May 2018,"Second time stay and more than impressed with the service and facilities provided. Special mention to Jeany an absolute Gem to the Sofitel, such a gorgeous soul, nothing is too much for her, no ask too great; our children absolutely adore her, as do we! Pool access room an absolutely must, who doesn't want a private pool at their convenience anytime of the day or night ! The tropical gardens are impecable and nothing like we have experienced at any other hotel! Absolutley in lush green tropical garden heaven! The food is A++ catering for every pallet, room service is hands down the best we've encountered from pillow requests to ice, anything you desire is not too much to ask! Rivera lunch is Ah-mazing!! No wonder so many tourists book from other resorts here just for this once a week feast its to die for! We love it!!We are back in 16 weeks 3rd time round and cannot wait! Keep up the good good nothing to fault so far! See you back in Sep! "
Eatforlife1,"Bedford, UK",Apr 2018,"Beware of beach peddlers selling fake silver jewellery. As a retired jeweller we enjoyed a great time at Nusa Dua beach apart from being ripped off from the beach sellers. We bought 3 bangles stamped with 925 (sterling silver mark) they weighed the correct weight only to find they were heavy silver plate over brass. The price paid was 25% over the silver bullion price, so ok didn't lose much money. These beach sellers say they are controlled by Bali tourism & have a number on with yellow jacket  JUST TELL THEM ""NO THANK YOU"""
SW-TA,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018,"The outer reef protects the beach. The ocean becomes a set of tidal pools at low tide, with many interesting marine creatures to discover (but it also means you can't swim or do other watersports half the time).At high tide, not much to see when snorkeling from the beach.The sand is rather coarse. Hotel staff keep the beach quite clean. There is a convenient walking/jogging path along the beach.Lack of non-hotel restaurants unfortunately (but look for Pirates Bay restaurant, highly recommended!)"
toroib,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,location is very good and really beautiful. I think every beach in Nusa Dua is just wonderful and definitely worth to visit. 
Tvler8,"St. Albert, Canada",May 2018,"Because we are here in the off season the beaches were basically empty, which was fine for us. The sand was well groomed."
Stewart F,"Wilton, Australia",May 2018,"We stayed at the Anaya Resort Friendly staff lovely placeBut the food could do with an upgrade , there is plenty for breakfast depending on taste and culture We had a meal in the Restaurant the other night and payed $180 aus and the steak was tough , we also ordered fries with our meal and they came out after we finished the steaks "
Thewayiseeit,"Mosta, Russia",May 2018,"Nusa Dua Bali beach is a long public beach which you can walk along There are many food stalls, massage stalls, vendors, restaurants and hotels along the shore. The beach  has some nice areas but mostly it is full of plastic bottles, plastic bags, odd flip flops, sea grass. Not areas are created equal!! Dogs wander on the beach as well they are harmless."
Elizabeth T,95 contributions,Apr 2018,The beach was very dirty we actually spent time picking up garbage that floated in with the tire. Not a surf beach but good for swimming if you don't mind swimming in plastic garbage. 
madre&padre,Montenegro,May 2018,"Coast is amazing with long sendy beach and beautifull plant and threes whos give deep shadow. Many resort with pool and garden. You can hire sunbeds in resort for 20 euro per person and you got towel and you can use pool. You can hire sunbeds outside resort for 7 euro per 3 hrs per person and you got towel and shower. Hughe minus is dirty sea with plastic, paper, naylon bags etc...on this beach waves not so big."
324MNRao,"Bengaluru, India",May 2018,"Nice beach to visit in the evenings. During morning, it would be too hot with sun shining above you, unless you wish to sunbathe, avoid visiting during many ending hours. "
kazia66,"Rainham, UK",May 2018,The beach itself is fabulous and the see a beautiful blue colour. There aren't many rocks either but it is tidal so in the afternoon the water is really far back. Best to get your swimming in earlier in the day. There is also a small plastic waste problem but the staff are doing their best to clear it away.
Anna B,67 contributions,May 2018,"Beautiful beach. Lovely sand and nice water, but dirty. Even the staff is trying to clean up every day. Is not very nice to swim in it. "
andersjhansson,"Lund, Sweden",May 2018,"This beach is with a lovely view and a perfect spot for seeing the sunrise. Seeing the waves break out by the reef is beautiful in sunrise. The biggest problem with the beach is all the trash, both in the water and on the beach itself. The resorts along the beach employ beach cleaners that mostly rake together that trash and then dig a hole and throw it in there. This results in a clean beach for a couple of hours until the tide  washes out these ‚Äútrash holes‚Äù again. This way of handling the trash results in it being washed out into the ocean again, unfortunately. "
Joe M,"Merrylands, Australia",May 2018,"Nusa Dua Beach is safe, clean and family friendly.  We enjoyed the stroll along the water.Not suitable for surfers  "
Halidya,11 contributions,Feb 2018,Beautiful sand that makes me want to go back. You have to looking around with bicycle and enjoying the scenery !
BarbaraZH,Zurich,Apr 2018,"We've been to many Bali beaches but love this one. It's clean, great to walk, swim and play, easy to walk in and great for kids."
Barry Sloan,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"Great place to relax and have a swim, very reminiscent of the beaches back home..Easy beach to take youngsters too..Take a dip, you‚Äôll love itüèù"
Ashok S,10 contributions,Apr 2018,"It's a good beach to look at. But at low tide, the water is very shallow and you have to go out for about 200 meters to get enough depth to swim. There are many sharp rocks below water. Wearing beach footwear is advised."
JokkeNu,"Vilnius, Lithuania",Apr 2018,A nice beach to spend a lazy day at. Not so crowded and quite and good. We'll worth spending some time at..
FaizalP61,"Sungai Buloh, Malaysia",Apr 2018,Nice beach but slope is rather steep with unconsolidated coarse sand - so hard to walk along the beach without sinking to the ankles ( maybe beech was artificially created.)
ChanD92,69 contributions,Apr 2018,"Not too hot because of a lovely breeze from the sea. Lots of staff clearing the seaweed and bits from the sea and sand constantly . Very relaxing, Not over crowded when we were there and places to get cheap but good drinks and food. Absolutely amazing scenery and a temple which is only a short walk away. "
patro2016,"Navi Mumbai, India",Apr 2018,"The Beach is very clean with surfs. The under current is bit strong, so one has to be careful when entering water."
DavidW1212,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2018,A little bit of rubbish in the water but generally clean and clear. The locals are always out cleaning as apposed some of the other beaches in Bali. Highly recommend.
StevieG400,"Crewe, UK",Apr 2018,"We visited Nusa Dua beach while at the Westin Hotel . The beach was okay , sandy but in the mornings a lot of seaweed and debris was accumulated on the beach . This was a little disappointing as the hotel and grounds were excellent . "
leevickers7131,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,beautiful beach and setting few bars dotted about and some hawkers about but not a pain like some can be shame about the sea hope its not a regular occurrence 
NatureGirl,"Vancouver, Canada",Mar 2018,"This beach is situated in Nusa Dua which is only 15 min away from the Bali airport at Depensar. It has a few large and swanky resorts. The one we chose was call Ayodya hotel which I discovered was on the best and cleanest part of this beach. Visitors from the other hotels walk over to this part of the beach. Ayodya was amazing, but way too large for us. Good for a few nights only. Souvenir shopping just outside the hotel on the main drag is amazing. Prices are cheap so feel free to buy all your gifts there! We traveled everywhere after that and found out later. Great restaurant selection outside. Beach in this area is very polluted which is unfortunate... if you can look aside the garbage, it‚Äôs a true blue glittering gem of an ocean here! White sandy beaches and hot sun! Enjoy!"
MsVietnam,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2018,"Nusa Dua is nice and quiet compared to other areas. Best swimming is on the high tide, sand beautiful and not crowded."
Mishmashoflife,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2018,Definitely the better place to go in Bali the rest of them were not great. As soon as we arrived here it was calm no cab drivers hassling you well a couple at the front but that was all. The beach was bliss nice cafes not over populated and really pleasant we got to swim in the ocean. No Rubbish at this beach which was great as the others in Bali let it down.great little bar you don‚Äôt need to take too much as it‚Äôs all there. It was clean and well kept. Loved the fact security were there it filters out the crap. Worth a visit. 
Lisaontheroad94,Sweden,Apr 2018,It is my first visit to Bali and I am in chock! The ocean is so dirty with floating rubbish I do not want my children to enter the beach or the water. The hotels are trying to keep the beach clean but it is a fight they can not win - the ocean is completely polluted and it breaks my heart to see what we have done to the planet.
Louise J,"Cardigan, UK",Apr 2018,"We were so disappointed when we walked down to the sea from the beach club. Glass bottles, plastic straws, bags and packaging along the shoreline and lots floating in the sea.Another hotel resident found a medical needle washed up too!!The rubbish on the beach stayed there the whole week as we visited the beach twice and nothing had changed.These big name hotel chains using the beach really need to keep the beach clean and safe for their guests as they are advertising their wonderful beach clubs. It was a very sad situation."
Susan W,14 contributions,Apr 2018,Very nice to walk along past some other very nice hotels and you may also see a couple of weddings along the way 
bristolsystems,"Ban Dung, Thailand",Apr 2018,A nice clean long beach with a few places to sit and eat or drink there are a few high end hotels that back onto the beach so their chairs etc are out of bounds but there are some you can rent .the beach itself is very nice with nice white sand and crystal clear water great for a swim 
Pmurphp,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"Beautiful beach shame about the debris. Made a nice change from the hotel pool and some resorts organise daily beach activities,"
Mohitkantalways,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2018,"Nusa Dua beach should be visited in evenings or mornings. Great place to walk ,jog and even participate in Yoga organized by hotel during mornings.You need to register first at desk"
Rukshra,"San Ramon, CA",Apr 2018,"Beautiful beach, but the plastic is just awful. We saw dirty nappies, plastic bottles and even asthma inhalers in the water. The hotels try to do their best by cleaning up the beach but it is an impossible task.Bali has to get ahead of their plastic problem before it is irreversible "
Dave C,"Subic, Philippines",Apr 2018,Quite a lot of plastic debris is in the corners in the northern section of the beaches but I guess that's normal in most places these days unfortunately. It is a good quality Beach apart from that with a nice surf Clearwater and a nice breeze coming off the sea.
Lu M,"Tarrawanna, Australia",Apr 2018,"Growing up in an area back home with the beach at our door this beach has a more tropical feel about it. Please note some of the beaches are private and belong to the resort that it is next to. Saying this a lot of the beaches are for the public. After a visit to Seminyak beach Nusa Dua was much cleaner with minimal litter lining the beach. For a small fee you can access a lot of the private beaches with chair and umbrella hire as well as surf boards and other water crafts. If you do get a chance have a go at snorkeling, with a few easy to access reef it is great for first timers. "
John S,"Ventura, CA",May 2017,It's my favorite stretch of beach with some nice resorts. I prefer the beaches here and the fact there is is a shopping center short distance away by taxi. There are some good restaurants and cafes in the shopping center as well. It's about 20 minutes from the bustle of Kuta and Jimbaran. 
Ranjit Laxman,"Thalassery, India",Apr 2018,"This splendid white sand beach at the western edge of the enclave retains lots of the character that is missing in the santisied Nusa Dua resort zone. Generally safe for swimming and some beach side warungs. A large swathe of the Nusa Dua and Tanunj Benoa beachfront is connected via anice walking path, and morning walks here are especially recommended. The foothpath runs from just in front of the Ayodya Resort in the south for about 7 kms north to the Grand Mirage on the Tanunj Benoa spit. Nusa Dua offers many watersport activites such as banana boating, jetskiing, parasailing, scuba diving and so on."
Anne G,"Northcote, Australia",Apr 2018,"Lovely calm and clean beach. No hassles, water activities available. Great lounges and relaxing environment. Vendors on the beach were pleasant and respectful. "
The Walking Critic,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"I'm an early bird that savours the more tranquil and less hot hours of the day and Nusa Dua Beach is like many others in Bali. Great and safe for swimming, though some times of the year you'll get waste washed up on the sands. This afflicts every beach but is not the case all year around."
Lulu T,119 contributions,Nov 2017,"Been staying in Melia and Grand Hyatt Bali, both situated along the strips of Nusa Dua beach. Very calming atmosphere, less crowded compare to Kuta/sanur/seminyak beach. Most importantly is gentle waves so its save for our little one to play in the water. Love it. "

notnormalman,9 contributions,Apr 2018,"Not a real Bali if you won't go out from the resort.Well overpriced compared to reality of Bali but if you like luxury and reality of Bali overwhelming you, stay inside the bubble."
CarlitosDuke,"Cartagena, Colombia",Apr 2018,"It‚Äôs a lovely beach, good for basics when you are by the beach. I only think, the hotels should get together and run cleaning campings. Also the local authorises should get involved. Sometimes you can see lots of plastic by the water and sand.  Think about the environment and the positives will bring having a clean beach. "
keithY651,"London, UK",Apr 2018,"In some respects this is a great beach, in others it just doesn't work. It looks good with waves always breaking on the reef offshore. It has a large tidal reach with shallow water meaning that it you want to swim it is not possible at low tide when the water retreats maybe half a mile. The sand is also not particularly appealing and is not any good for kids and building sandcastles. As someone that likes to jog on the beach in the morning it was impossible as it is the type of sand that doesn't take any weight. However it is shallow and doesn't shelve and therefore it is a relatively safe beach for kids. The beach is lined by mostly hotels that all have their own loungers. There are some locals selling the usual touristy stuff but they are not aggressive and move on if ignored."
panko4,"Samford, Australia",Apr 2018,"Not always the case, as depends on the tides, the resorts  are always doing clean ups of seaweed & rubbish . Safe to swim & fun for  the kids once the tides goes out to poke around in the sheltered area ankle deep."
Paula S,9 contributions,Apr 2018,"Is a huge pity to have a wonderful place ruined like this :( The water is clear, hot temperature, the beach is beautiful but you at Inside an have plastic bottles and packages floating around... felt a great pity of how we ruin amazing natural landscapes like this."

KEGZ82,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,We stayed in Westin so the beach is just nearby. There are plenty of people offering ski jet and other water sports. Work hard to negotiate for a much much better deal. We tried the banana boat and the children love it. 
DennyYau,51 contributions,Apr 2018,"We payed an entrance fee to use a resort. Be prepared to pay this fee if you would like a sun lounger and have a place to cool down out of the sun!The entrance fee is worth the money, you get access to the loungers with towels and a drink (may vary depending on resort), you also get to use their shower, toilet and swimming pool! All in all Nusa Dua is a very nice beach, bits of plastic here and there which was a shame - but it wasn't terribly polluted. For food you could eat at the resorts available, or you could walk out to one of the nearby malls where they have some restaurants dotted about. The access to the resorts and close-by mall really helps with planning and spending a day out at this beach"
arorabajaj,"Lucknow, India",Apr 2018,Amazing beach. Clean and serene. Perfect sand and waters. Loved every part of it. The brown sand had it all
Roger R,"Yens, Switzerland",Apr 2018,"The white sand and idillic sea view on the Nusa Penida island in front are pretty much ruined by the uncountable plastic debris floating in the water and washed ashore.Despite some efforts by the staff from the different hotela to collect the junk by hand, the volume is too much to remain unnoticed wheb swimming or walking on the beach.Depending on wind and weather the problem is more or less bad. In the mornings it tends to be the least as the sea is calmer.The issue is not specific to Nusa Dua, as we encountered simmilar situations on every beach in Bali."

Pay 500k (3 sunbeds / towels) = 400k spend in the restaurant, so you pay just 100k for towels...Younger kids = morning = big waves. Better to come around 3pm and later."
Martine I,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Mar 2018,"This enormous stretch of beach leads off many beautiful hotels situated in Nysa Dua. There are ‚Äúbuoys‚Äù in the sea which demarcate how far one can swim. Sea is lovely and warm and when we were there, very calm. However at ‚Äúlow tide‚Äù the sea receded and sand banks were clearly visible! We asked a tour guide who explained that this often happens when there is ‚Äú no moon‚Äù as opposed to FULL MOON! "

milly591,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",Apr 2018,We were in nusa dua and this beach was nice but full of algea and sometimes bottles floating and garbage but compared to other beaches at least not too many sellers on the beach you can relax...
Robert S,"Woudrichem, The Netherlands",Mar 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is a pleasant wide and white sand beach, nice for walking along the waves, the ocean swell is dampened bij the reefs a few meters off the coast, at high tide the waves can exert a strong pulling force, however it is never dangerous to swim in the warm and clean sea, at times red warning flags are pinned to warn parents with small children and elderly swimmers for relative strong waves and current"
Megan C,"Umhlanga, South Africa",Apr 2018,"Lovely clean beach, offers tradesmen, swimming , braiding, water sports . When the tide goes out the seabed is full of little surprises to explore and is wonderfully clean. "

A_Amri,"Manama, Bahrain",Apr 2018,"This is one of the best beaches in Bali as some of the others can collect trash after the rains. Clean beach and good for swimming during high tide, not worth it in low tide."
eglier1,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2018,"Hi,It is a place to visit if you are around, I found it a good place to stay with family and close to the resorts and hotels. Many surfers there but they do not interfere with the swimmers. Some basic restorants can be found over there for a decent lunch.The beach is good but unfortunately we saw some trash in the beach (plastic bags, etc). Even though some people is cleaning the beach in the afternoon it seems that it is not enough to keep it clean. A lot of more work should be done to improve the cleanliness of this place."

CatherineBH,"San Diego, CA",Mar 2018,"My husband and I hired Putu Bali Driver Tour.  Our first stop from our hotel in Kuta was Nusa Dua.  It is where high class resorts line the white sand beaches.  The vast grounds are beautifully manicured, and the beach is very clean in contrast to Kuta.  We stopped by to see the water blow hole at the end of beautiful park.  The water was calm so the water blow hole was not spectacular.  "

You can walk four a few hours along this coastline and see it change with every turn. Recommended for adults who love to explore the many food options and who love to walk. There are also lots of beaches to hire a chair and chill out for the day. 
nixbeley,Singapore,Mar 2018,"Great waters, strong waters which we absolutely loved! Much cleaner than Kuta or Seminyak. We also took the opportunity to ride a jetski which the kids thoroughly enjoyed."
tigger2594,"Toowoomba, Australia",Mar 2018,This is a traditional white sandy beach.Due to its lovely sand it has attracted lots of hotels along the shoreline and they all seem to share it the benefits for their guests.Lovely to wonder along on this warm evening. Some might say romantic. A fellow guest was telling me it was lovely toWalk  Along this morning as the beach faces east and gets the sunrise.
Bradpitt2016,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018,Nusa Dua beach has golden sand that is maintained by the resorts and free of debris and plastic found on some other beaches.There are high quality restaurants along the beachfront that are reasonably priced considering they belong to 5 star resorts.A few vendors but very low pressure.Nice upmarket feel .
B674XIthomasb,"Santa Fe, NM, United States",Feb 2018,"It's an excellent place to stroll along the water, to lounge on the comfortable chaise longues with large umbrellas provided by the St. Regis (service staff will provide cold water, and the beach bar is only a few steps away)"
dobeglobe,"Antwerp Province, Belgium",Feb 2018,Weird title? Maybe! Haha- but what I am trying to say is that Nusa Dua is more for older people or young couples- not a lot of kids running around. The beaches are quite and clean and the water is defintely clearer than in Kuta/Seminyak. You can do great water sport activities in Nusa Dua too. Great for activities + relaxation and less beach vendors than in the south.
Kelly M,33 contributions,Mar 2018,Such a beautiful beach. Lovely to stroll along . Loved all the resorts right on the beach and also the pathway that goes along. We had a young bub and it ment we could take our stroller. Lots of great restaurants along the beach. Perfect for a relaxing holiday or day trip

My friend had wanted to snorkel and this beach was not suitable for this at all.  I think if you are going to snorkel in Bali you would need to rent a boat for this.  It was a nice beach with white sand, and easy to get into and out of the water.  However you needed to wear beach shoes as there are rocks in the water itself as well as some weeds. We also saw some garbage in the water which surprised us as we have not seen that at the other beaches we have been in the world.We ordered drinks so that we could use the table and chairs at one of the vendors casual restaurants. We did enjoy the swim and the quiet location after a day of looking at the sights and sitting in the car."
"Mark Sullivan, NSW Australia",4 contributions,Mar 2018,Do yourself a favour & visit the beautiful sands of a Nusa Dua Beach via a stay at one of the magnificent hotels along the coast. 
Gilang Wardhana,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"The beach is clean, water depth is shallow, wave not so strong, very nice for swimming. The sand more brighter compared to Seminyak beach."
Ibrahim H,"Cairo, Egypt",Mar 2018,Good and calm beach sandy it's beside local beach but still have privacy  you can rebt a bike there with good price .
Amanda-Jo W,"Glenelg, Australia",Mar 2018,"This being my fourth visit to Indonesia, I have visited lots of beaches, Nusa Dua beach is definitely a favourite! I would recommend Nusa Dua Beach some where for families with young children to stay or couples wanting somewhere quiet to get away. The water is clear clean and calm most days. It is not as busy as most beaches. Although we had a beautiful lagoon like pool at our resort we chose to swim in the beach most days. Already planning a trip back with extended family!"
ImranTitil,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"On a sunny day when the weather is good, the beach is just awesome. But, during the low tide, the beach moves further making it unappealing"
Timetravelbug,"Dapto, Australia",Mar 2018,This is probably one of the better beaches in the south of Bali. Personally if you want to experience true Balinese culture and the amazing beaches they have on offer you are better off heading east or north of Bali. Outside the typical tourist areas and away from all the trash that follows 
TravellerNL010,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Mar 2017,The beach at Nusa Dua is absolutely amazing. Clear water and beautiful light brown sand. Well maintained and clean. Seeing the sunrise from this beach is fantastic.
Rafaella Pessoa,"Sao Paulo, SP",Feb 2018,"Located inside a ""turistic complex"", it is full of turists. The water is super clean and blue, different from others beaches around Kuta. It is ideal for swimming!"
DiditP57,"Depok, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Went to nusa dua beach on christmas holiday with big family of 13. The beach has beautiful scenery, clean and quiet compares to crowded kuta beach. It has no waves with white sands which is suits to take the baby and kids to play. "
Cafearara,"Belgrade, Serbia",Jan 2018,"long white sand,  clean water, clen beach, place for volleyball, .Highly recommended.My favorite beach in Bali."
John Paul O,1 contribution,Mar 2018,"very nice place and the sand is definitely pure like hawaii and Boracay, highly recommended for business and couples. "
anton10186,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Feb 2018,I love the beach and well maintain by hotelRecomend for place for family game and sunsetWe was there and enjoy the beach with happiness
clara427,"Newbury, UK",Mar 2018,What a delightful place to stay. The staff are super friendly and very helpful. We were greeted with cold towels and tropical cocktails. The beach and pool areas are maintained very well and they are gorgeous. The breakfast buffet is the best we have had.
Michael T,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018,It‚Äôs been around for 30 years but the development still affords holiday makers everything they need from grocery shopping to high end purchases. Restaurants abound and the beach is still pretty clean. No trailer trash here.....ü§£
SharenG22,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2018,"A beautiful spot for a walk and a swim, lots of little bays and the beach just goes on and on.  Lots of market stalls selling all the usual items/clothesA great choice of restaurants and cafes for all budgets.Beautiful at night all lit up in front of the many hotels. "
sarahliz68,"Dromana, Australia",Mar 2018,"I would normally stay in Kuta or Legian , first time in Nusa Dua...beach is a lot cleaner , clear water,  quiet. I would recommend üëå"
RayFla,"Melbourne, Florida",Mar 2017,The waves at Nusa Dua get really big. It separates the boys from Men. Quick reallers rolling down the beach. Some of the resorts are territorial. Meaning if you aren't staying keep going. 
Jason B,"Swansea, UK",Sep 2017,"Lovely area, as long as you are staying in one of the beachfront hotels, otherwise go elsewhere. We found 1 place you could get a drink"
JulesReviews,"Welland, Canada",Feb 2018,"I was told this was one of the best beaches in Bali, so we went there one day in Feb 2018. The beach was pretty good, but not awesome.  The sand was good, and water nice for swimming. There were vendors on the beach offering food and drinks at fair prices.  We rented two chairs and umbrella for around $10 US, and had a nice afternoon. My expectations of Bali‚Äôs beaches were much higher than what actually exists there.  "
jimmy k,21 contributions,Mar 2018,"Just awesome!!! The beach is clean. You can sew the sands in my picture, they‚Äôre so soft. Love it!!!"
Stig M,"Doha, Qatar",Feb 2018,"Stayed at Conrad hotel, can recommend with its great location and service minded staff, have stayed there 2 times before. Nusa Dua beach wonderful sand and clean, perfect to run or just walk."
travelerxhan,California,Feb 2018,"When we were at the Grand Hyatt Bali last time in 2016, we were surprised by how much plastic trash was on the beach and in the ocean. There was hardly any (though still some) this time around. The beach is very beautiful and it's nice that it's private for each of the resorts.There are also lots of water activities that you can do. A lot of reviewers have noted that the cost is much higher at Nusa Dua compared to, say, Kuta. This is true--the costs are about double from that of Kuta but if you don't want to deal with traffic and you're already staying at a resort at Nusa Dua, it may not be worth the hassle to go all the way down to Kuta just to save a little bit of money since you still have to pay for a taxi. For example--a 1 hour surfing lesson plus 1 hour of board rental afterwards is approximately 200,000 rupiah (~$15 USD) at Kuta and 400,000 rupiah at Nusa Dua (~$30 USD). A taxi may cost close to $8 USD each way so you're pretty much at the same price. If you're at Nusa Dua, it makes sense just to do the activities there as well."
Saeid N,"Tehran, Iran",Mar 2018,"This beach is beautiful and so clean in the bali, and absolutely is one of the best beaches  and if you want a good beach for swimming, diving, snorkeling or relaxing, you should visit this place."
Hacendado,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, UK",Jan 2018,"We were in Nusa Dua for a few days and walked to the beach although we didn't spend a great deal of time there.  It was clean and tidy, although not busy.  There were a few refreshment options, but none seemed to have cold beer.  Plenty of options if you want a massage too."
Gary&Theresa,"Durham, UK",Feb 2018,We had spoken to friends who had stayed elsewhere in Bal and all agree the beach in Nusa Dua is the best 
amir,"Tehran, Iran",Feb 2018,"very clean beach , good for swimming and sunbathing white sand ( but not very soft like Phuket ) . you JUST could find expensive bar & restaurant . sun bed & other service are also expensive . in this area you just find 5 star hotels BUT  I went 3 days to that beach . I bought some foods from Kuta and got Uber (about 80000 IDR) and have amazing time , definitely recommended"
Antoni O,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Feb 2018,Enjoy the white sand and blue sea. It's one of the best beaches I have ever visited. It's a paradise.
Francois-Xavier S,"Como, Italy",Feb 2018,"The beach is nothing special, but clean and calm.You have a bench of 5 stars hotel on the front, with good bars and massage stations."
choyyinkong,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,It is a white sandy beach with lot if people visiting the place for swimming and surfing. Near to the beach there is a park to walk around. Saw few hawker stall selling food and drinks around the beach. Nice place to hang out.
TAMember270218,"Jindabyne, Australia",Feb 2018,"Hello, We stayed at the Grand Aston and have also stayed at the Grand Mirage both have very good beach fronts but in front of the Aston was allot better in our opinion, they are only separated by a stones throw but the resorts in question may spend a bit more time cleaning their own backyard, don't know but we liked the beach in front of the Aston and the further you went south, i think it was south seemed to get better.At low tide you can walk out to where the reef starts in front of the Aston, but don't get caught the tide comes in pretty fast.Worth the walk out there.As far Nusa Dua beach itself very nice but seems to get busy, unless you are staying at a resort directly on that beach look at going early otherwise battle with joe public."
Siddhartha C,18 contributions,Jul 2017,One of the best beach in bali with luxurious resorts around and great view of white sand-sea green water combination.The beach is less crowded as almost all the hotels have private beach. You can have surfing and swiming.Donot miss nusa dua while having a vacation at bali.
Jon S,65 contributions,Feb 2018,Walked along a large stretch of sand stopping at various hotels for the shade and a few drinks. The ladies selling goods along the way made haggling fun.
Marta E,4 contributions,Feb 2018,"Nusa Dua Bali beach is amazing, white send super clean, blue sea. Highly recommended. Defenetly come back again."
Venkatesh S,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,Its a clean and calm beach to laze around in the afternoon. A lot of premium properties around. Great for evening walks.
jenny c,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,"I have now stayed in Nusa Dua twice and absolutely love this area. The beaches and water are beautiful,  clean and very inviting. The area is quiet compared to other areas of Bali, a feature i love. There are still good restaurants easily accessible from this area. Having been to Bali a number of times now, I have decided a relaxing holiday in Nusa Dua will always be my future holiday destination when returning. "
diddydiDorset,dorset,Feb 2018,We visited the private part of this beach at the grand mirage bali. The beach is sheltered and oart of it is netted off to make it safer. There are hundreds of speed boats jetskis banana boats eyc so you have to be careful and keep a good watch to not get injured. Lovely sunset though and nice sand. 
Kadek W,36 contributions,Feb 2018,"Enjoy bali,if you want japanes and english driver dont worry i ll assist you in bali, we want make your holliday more componion. "
Darien,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Feb 2018,The beach is extremely clean and the waves are extremely calm and not choppy at all. The sunset was really nice too.
Naran K,"Romford, UK",Feb 2018,"One of best beaches in Bali if you want to just chill and enjoy Bali. As there are mostly five star resorts in this area, the beaches are cleaned and combed regularly. Even though the beach it self is not private it does feel like they are private beaches. "
Alex C,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2018,"My favorite beach in Bali. Long clean stretches of sand with great water. Only complain is that there are few or no roadside stalls where you can have local food/alcohol, so you're out of luck if you don't stay at one of the beach side mega resorts here."
bernieclark2017,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,"We stayed at the Westin resort,which has this beach at its front ,right at the Ikan Restaurant. The beach in either direction has a pathway for walking,running and cycling.The beach is enjoyed constantly by families in particular and there is much to do re water sports etc.the views of the ocean and islands are good."
Nikki A,"Wrea Green, UK",Feb 2018,Beautiful beach with 5 star hotels and bars along the beach edge. The water was lovely to swim in. Very clean. 
Riddhima Sheth,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2018,We rented a cycle to go around Nusa Dua. We saw Waterblow and Nusa Dua beach. Cycling around was fun with great scenery around. Would definitely recommend renting a cycle. 
Freedom755677,10 contributions,Feb 2018,The beach at Ayodya Resort is really really nice and especially the way the Ayodya Resort spills onto it is magnificent. Great design with the infinity pool + beach bar + colourful setting flowing onto the sands.
Alina-Maria M,"Ketsch, Germany",Feb 2018,"This was a great part of Bali that me and my husband really enjoyed. The restaurants, beaches and hotels are really out of this world!"
GEDE_JONY,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"This is one of the best beach in bali,located in south of island, nice view of two small island that call nusadua,also popular with waterblow, and there are also clean area,big hindu statue,large area for kids also to play arround,and of course get sun and just lying down in the white sand beach."
Marynka A,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jan 2018,"If you have small children, this beach is for you. For an adult which likes to swim it is quite boring. The dearest place near the fence is up to the chest. Some places are full with the seagrass, that is why morning swim following the beach will not really work..."
jessiecat25,"Milton Keynes, UK",Feb 2018,"What a stunning beach!, beautiful white soft sand, clear blue waters that are warm and inviting.  It's like a little lagoon with no waves and stays shallow for a long way out giving you the confidence that it's more than safe to relax in the waters.  Little fish can be seen darting about. If you're after banana boats and jet skis whizzing up and down all day long then this isn't the beach for you. Beach cleaners from the surrounding hotels are constantly raking up washed up seaweed and keeping this beach pristine. The only annoyance is the 'lookie, lookie' sales men and women regularly stopping to sell you their wares, but they are friendly and polite and do move on.  I have had worse experiences with this in the world! "
Amin M,"Rasht, Iran",Feb 2018,Nusa dua beach is located near Grand hayatt resort and Bali collection. It was buillt carefully and nicely. It has twe or more pinninsulas and it is comfort place for taking sun bath. 
Neha K,Noida,Oct 2017,"I found the beach overly crowded. It is primarily for water sports lovers. They have a range of activities like parasailing, donut boat ride, flying fish, banana boat, jet ski, glass bottom boat etc. Found a little expensive. Did donut boat ride which was fine, but glass bottom boat ride was not worth it. They claim to show fish below, but we saw none. The beach itself is not very clean. Overall my experience was not so good as I am not into water sports. I realized later that with limited time in hand, could have explored something else. So if you are really into this, then only go. As there are much better beaches in Bali."
POOJAbd,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2017,"In the month of October, Nusa Dua beach is even more gorgeous with the local festival. Food trucks offering local food, games for kids, enough options to shop for coffee and live bands, the Nusa Dua beach festival was simply amazing. The beach was a 5-7mins drive from our hotel. We enjoyed an evening walking around the clean beach and just relaxing with our kiddo. This is a must visit!"
Andalah A,"Uttara, Bangladesh",Jan 2018,Amazing resort with beautiful views and hospitality. Went for our honeymoon and not only did we enjoy the comfortable atmosphere but also the beach and most importantly we loved the area Nusa Dua. It‚Äôs heavenly.
Tatiana G,17 contributions,Oct 2017,"It was a perfectly relaxing week on the beach! I enjoyed nicely warm water, sun and sand. All this in Oktober when in my home country is cold and rainy."
Sherly,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Located near a lot of hotels. Watched the sunset here and it looks so beautiful. Don't forget to bring your camera to capture the beauty of Nusa Dua Beach. Not as crowded as other beaches in Bali, perfect place to relax."
Gaurav J,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is a long strip that runs parallel to fancy hotels, it is okayish, mostly hotel guests are to be found on there.It quite a long beachfront but the distance to the water is not that much, so one can sit by the bear while the kids play. It is clean and safe. If you walk towards the opposite side of the pier, you come to the real public side of the beach where locals hang and sellers sell their wares. I would suggest you make the trek. it is worth it.It is not Miami beach if you are staying at one of the hotels, this is more than adequate. I wouldn't get into a cab just to come visit though."
marchelza,"New Bedford, MA",Jan 2018,"In the early morning low tide time, I see people can walk really far away from the beach. Not very crowded. You can also do water sports at the beach"
timothymcnmara666,"Nuneaton, UK",Jan 2018,"The beach was a picture post card , in some parts it sloped significantly and the sand was very soft under foot if you had any difficulties / poor mobility you could easily get into trouble as you sink into sand . We met a couple from Australia who pointed out to us the areas where strong undercurrents could quickly knock you off your feet , not ideal for young and elderly bathers . My wife felt very uneasy in the break waters as you isn't a strong swimmer.Wind surfing, parasailing & kayaking all available and great fun , all the hotel beach bars welcome in non residence which allows you to sample what they have on offer.Overall great beach experience ."
Aydar A,18 contributions,Feb 2018,"I was really surprised by the water quality when I came there. It was absolutely crystal clear so that I could see my toes in the water while being submerged up to my chest in water. No waves at all (because of the coral reef belt surrounding the area in the distance), but there is at times a strong current (strong enough to make standing still on your feet difficult) flowing along the coast line from right to left so be careful. And yeah there are so many beautiful fishes in the water and sea creature, inhabitants of the coral reef! You just need to swim maybe some 20-30 metres away from the shore to find them (and the water will be still up to your neck only).But beware of sea snakes which I saw twice in the water. Although they're mild-tempered and reluctant to waste their venom on us, they attack if provoked. So the best option would be swimming with goggles or snorkeling with a mask and watching where you're placing your feet if you swim far enough from the shore.The beach has clean sand with no rubbish on it. And there weren't many people on it! "
paul k,"Fareham, UK",Jan 2018,"A beautiful beach with golden sands. You can walk to various locations in either direction. Whether it be for shopping, bars or restaurants.A peaceful relaxing environment or as lively as you want it (water sports)Recommend "
LeeDaniel,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Feb 2018,It was a very hot day when we visited the beach. It was a good view and nice scenery. Defiantly a great place to revisit again and of course for surfing. 
Carly L,"Cherrybrook, Australia",Jan 2018,"This beach has nice and fine sand which is great for kids to play with. Sections of the beach are very dirty with lots of debris. Only the sections next to the major resorts are relatively clean. Even though lots of dead coral reef got washed up the beach, it is not a great place for snorkelling - you cannot see much from the water near shore. "
Jonathan R,"Helsingborg, Sweden",Jun 2017,"Clean, white, sandy beaches however tons of tourists and also in some places there's a ""border"" you cannot cross when swimming out. "
Walter S,"Vienna, Austria",Feb 2018,"Guess Raunak is talking about Kuta beach as mentioning Queens indicates!We agree with many others and think Nusa Dua beach between the Las Vegas like Mulia and the beautiful landscaping of the Gran Hyatt is a relaxing little paradise.Clean nearly white sands, moderate waves and just enough guests to not make it feel deserted.The paved walkway from one end to the other links some beautiful properties, all open for guests, not for locals!Nothing is cheap here, but why should it be? Well maintained creating a lot of work for locals. We love to come back to our little paradise after a day in the Bali reality outside Nusa Dua."
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,Best beach so far in Bali. This area translates as 'two islands' and there are two beaches either side of the volcanic where the 'Water Blow' feature is located.Effectively a privately owned beach - owned by the dozen or so 'resorts' and certainly far different from most other parts of Bali.2186
Raunak_jain23,"Jodhpur, India",Feb 2018,Crowded dirty beaches. Watersports were very costly and had to negotiate a lot. Would not be coming again for sure. Best place to eat indian food was QUEENS. Superb food. 
Lucy B,"London, UK",Jan 2018,"The beach is quiet as it doesn't have the typical large waves. It is very pleasant to swim there, especially during the low tide. The beach is clean. Probably one of the best beaches in Bali to swim in. Surrounding hotels have own beach chairs but there is also a public area. I felt very safe there."
lokeshj847,"Calangute, India",Jan 2018,A place for couples to go and have a relaxing trip. Visit to the beach is a must. A good shopping area nearby called Bali collection. Lot of eating and shopping options
Luke H,12 contributions,Jan 2018,Very beautiful and the sand is kept clean. The water is shallow for a long time. Great for children but watch out for rocks in large patches under the water. A little rubbish under the water. I think most of the beach is owned by resorts and so you can‚Äôt use their area unless you pay $$$.
Ajoy2b,"Harbor Springs, MI",Jan 2018,What can be said about a beach in Bali besides fabulous.  All the fabulous resorts are along Nusa Dua beach with a meandering walkway.  We took a daily walk on the beach taking in all the beautiful resorts.  If you‚Äôre adventurous you can rent a surfboard or even get a massage on the beach.
Jennifer M,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,Went here because we are staying at Nusa Dua beach resort. Nice beach clean and got for sunbathing from the hotel garden.
Caroline T,"Ballarat, Victoria, Australia",Sep 2017,Nusa Dua and now Benoa are the premium must stay locations if you want a romantic escape or family stay. It is a good 20-30 mins from airport and kuta but kuta and legion are fine for shopping and a constant party but not very relaxing.  If you want luxury and true relaxation this is where you want to be.
Ilyas450,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Jan 2018,Probably the best beach in Bali. Really nice and clean. The beach is sort of private for residents of nearby hotels but everyone can go in.
totestravels99,44 contributions,Jan 2018,"Beautiful, clean, relaxing - what more can you want. Best beach in Bali! We have stayed at Nusa Dua twice (recently and about 3 years ago) and we could not wait to come back to Nusa Dua. We love walking from end to end along the path and seeing all the incredible resorts."
Mamba_11,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2018,"This is a must visit beach if you are in Bali for vacations. The entire area is actually developed for tourists. There are nice hotels which open up to this beach, so you may sit anywhere and order food and drinks. Water is very calm since it has a big Bay area, where waves don't form, son in case you are surfer, you might not get the right kick here."
Robsworldtoday,"Bristol, UK",Jan 2018,Clean well maintained and beds ..plenty of sports..walks..sea is very safe and warm...the workers and security are an amazing asset in the running of this beach. 
Augustin Daniel C,"Bucharest, Romania",Dec 2017,"Nusa Dua has a great beach, white sands which are very clean, just like the water. Nice place for getting tanned. It's a little bit difficult to swim, because of the ocean currents."
SickReviews,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,The water is surprisingly warm and the ocean looks beutiful from where you sit on the beach. Definitely recommend going.
Andrea G,"Mentone, Australia",Jan 2018,"What's there to say about a beach that hasn't been said before? This beach is pristine clean, turquoise blue & heavenly warm! The sand (so we found out) was very very coarse. It is almost like teeny pebbles. It's lovely & smooth, but a little chunky in the hair...& bathers... & everywhere else! Beware LOL!!! The beach wasn't overly packed & most sections are cordoned off for the various hotel club areas. Gorgeous beach, don't forget your hat & sunscreen!"
Pauls1692,"Townsville, Australia",Jan 2018,"Clean water, lovely beach sand and nice to walk along.  There is a footpath that runs along most of the resorts so if sand is not your thing, it is still easy to view, enjoy and experience.  Lots of hotels have seating space and allow you to order providing you pay cash.  Markets and hawkers are on the beach as well.  "
wanderlust119,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2018,Great beach! There‚Äôs a lot of surfers and SUP rentals along the beach. We stayed at Inaya and really enjoyed a cool drink while lounging on the beach. 
asti d,Indonesia,Jan 2018,"If you visit bali, dont miss this place!!!!!Nice place with clean and good view.You can enjoy this place with family, couple, or solo."
Kiran R,"Hounslow, UK",Jan 2018,I think the pictures say everything - fantastic!. Clean...quite...Easy to get to. Not much hassle from local traders. Good security. Most luxurious hotels have private beach.
Claudio D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,It is one of the best place in Bali where to go to the beach if you are not a surfer.Many blues color on the Ocean. Calm water.White Sand.Bring a sun shield... Or cream.Tanning factory. %-) 
mbruce28,"Kakinada, India",Jan 2018,"The beach was so nice in comparison the the beach at Seminyak. White, soft and clean unlike the one in Seminyak which is dirty, hard and covered in plastic debris"
316swagatag,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jan 2018,A beautiful beach to relax & also good for Surfing üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.A must visit if you are planning a trip to Bali.
ashishpaliwal,"Hyderabad, India",Dec 2017,We went to the beach around day time to try some water sports as this beach is famous for it. The view at the beach are pretty good but it felt bad to have dirt lying around in some areas. The cleanliness is not totally maintained.The water temperature was idle for swimming though.
ShivaniMoodley,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2018,"The waters are absolutely beautiful and breath taking. The beach is very clean, the ocean is clean. I honestly did not see litter on the part of the Nusa Dua beach I was on. Where I was, the sand was freshly raked every morning and saw the workers cleaning up anything on the sand including seaweed- hence the sand is very well maintained. Nusa Dua beach is one to visit. "
Eanna57,460 contributions,Jan 2018,"A nice sandy beach where the hotels each have their own particular patch. Peaceful and relaxing, each hotel is responsible for the cleanliness of their own areas. Usual beach traders for sports and souvenirs but they are not too intrusive. Good sand and safe for swimming."
Sarah R,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2018,Lovely day spent outside though be more mindful of applying sunscreen than I was... We are here in January and it has been overcast/raining a lot so be mindful of the time of year you are travelling if you want a sunny experience!
thehungrytraveller10,"George, South Africa",Jan 2018,"It is so hard to see these beautiful beaches and the ocean in the state that it is in. There is plastic everywhere. The little piece of beach outside of our hotel was kept fairly clean, but if you walk a little way along you see how an unkept beach next door looks. There is so loads of tiny polystyrene pieces everywhere. When we did an outing to do the sea walk I was shocked to see all of the rubbish floating on the water. Time for the government to initiate some sort of cleaning plan....seriously!!"
dagoeh,34 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice Beach, we swam on this beach about 4pm, just behind Ayodya hotel. warm water and clean area. it has another facility like sea walker, banana boat etc"
nareshojha,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Dec 2017,"Sofitel resort beach front is very nice with on the beach restaurant and place to have therapies. If you walk down there different hotels with their beachfront restaurants, which one can enjoy too."
McTed,"Shellharbour, Australia",Dec 2017,We stayed at Novotel Nusa Dua and their beach club is on Nusa Dua Beach. The beach and water were clean and the water is warm. There was a strong cross current though that weak swimmers should watch out for
KatrinJ_est,"Tallinn, Estonia",Jan 2018,"Its way more beautiful than Kuta beach and cleaner than Sanur one. Great place to swim with kids as well, just be aware that it gets deep quite quickly "
andi k,jakarta,Jan 2018,"Nusa Dua beach is one of the most beautiful beach in Bali.. We visited here during the new years holiday and it was very good, beautiful sand, clean and safe for children. The wave is blocked few metres away from the edge, so the children are safe to play.Will visit back..!"
STEVE F,"George, South Africa",Jan 2018,We stayed at Nusa Dua and were not disappointed. It's very different to the island of Lembongan. One can walk for miles along the paved walkways in front of many classy resorts and hotels. One can take a dip every few minutes along the entire stretch of the ocean front. The waves are gentle and calm and one can bob about for hours in the azure sea.  There are numerous sarong and dress stalls and many beach activities for the energetic. The beach bars are very special as one can enjoy a meal or an icy Bintang at any one of the resorts along the Nusa Dua beach. The beaches are uncrowded and more family oriented. If you are looking for huge surfer waves this is not your spot. It is more commercial but one can find a shady spot under a tree on the beach and enjoy a gentle morning people watching or soaking up the sun! 
Naveen Reddy,"Bengaluru, India",May 2017,A very good and nice place and also a must visit place in Bali. Especially the creation of water falls in the lime stones of beach when the waves hit the lime stones. It was an amazing experience to watch the same.
JUSTINE-JESSE,"Pretoria, South Africa",Jan 2018,A clean beach with small waves. Not the prettiest beach I‚Äôve seen. Fairly empty . The sand is not as white and fine as in some other countries! Water sports available. 
hart277,"Chicago, IL",Jan 2018,"The sand is not fine, but just small pebbles, so once you get a few feet into the water the pebbles get bigger and not as comfortable as fine sand, the water was warm but be careful as it was the most powerful ocean I‚Äôve every been in. "
Glenn M,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jan 2018,"Great beach, clean and safe for swimming. Warm water and clear. Close to restaurants and service provided by hotels. "
Horst S,"Norrtalje, Sweden",Jan 2018,"We really enjoyed the beach. I went to different spots on the beach for surfing, we did some snorkeling (only saw few fishes though) and swam a lot.Due to the wind direction, there was some rubbish in the water on some days. Also, the current was quite strong some days."
katiebiks,surrey,Dec 2017,Nice beach with cafes and hotels along the path. Water sports available. Theres really nothing else to say
emmagilmour1,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,seaweed is everywhere.   I noticed in some of the bigger resorts - Ritz Carlton & The Mulia they had clean sands and water.   It was hard to navigate in the water to sandy bottoms with so much seaweed
Dimas A K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,Clean beach with fine white sand. The waves so quiet and the wind so calm make us relax and want to sleep under the tree. Access to beach embarrasing but Nusa Dua complex is modern and so many Hotel & Resort around there.
TrueHotelReview,Scotland,Dec 2017,"The beach is nice, with soft sand and shallow waves. We felt safe taking the children into the water since the waves weren't big.  I think access along the beach is only for the various resorts that join onto the beach, although there were quite a few sellers along the beach."
Oka A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Come and visit Nusa Dua Resort complex, you won't regret...It's a manage area with lots of hotels, mall (Bali Collections) and restaurant with Nusa Dua beach in it, the beach so beautifull...Recommended to stay 1 or 2 night at this complex."
Fiona Conder,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Dec 2017,"Nice white sand beach, there is a enery fee of around 2000 0r 3000 ( 20 cents ) depending where you enter, or sometimes just a car park fee when you leave 10000 we found it was nice waves, water was not to bed one day and the next it was very dirty, so depends on the weather "
LoveTravel705693,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Jan 2018,Clean and beutiful beach has one of the best sea views with a nearby park and watersport activities.
jmajumdar,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Dec 2017,Good and clean beach. Had a nice time with my family. Good food stalls nearby. Had a good outing. Recommended
Rifat,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jan 2018,"We went there to do some water activities.... we did snorkeling ... it was ok but after that we ride on a banana boat , it was dangerous as we fell down from the boat ... water was clear .... we couldn't do paragliding as weather was not good.... "
Andre S,72 contributions,Jan 2018,"If you think that you have paid for an expensive hotel and that's gonna give a nice and relaxing holiday at the beach, the jet ski will prove otherwise.You're not allowed to swim any further than 15m at this shallow beach with no waves."
livvymonkey12,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2017,We had body massage on the beach under the comfy breeze in a really worth price (USD25 per hour)!! Many tourists tried this after we did (as it might appear a bit embarrass to do massage in the open area).
Johan-finsteen,"Egedal Municipality, Denmark",Dec 2017,"It is really sad how this beach like most of Bali is polluted and full of plastic. We where told ‚Äúit comes from Java‚Äù or ‚Äúit is from the rivers, cause it rained‚Äù . Well there is garbage everywhere when you drive in Bali jungle, rivers, sea, cities and roads. Do something about it it is your responsibility and you will loos tourist to other destinations in the long run."
bobsabran,"Bogor, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Clean, quiet, semi exclusive beach but you still can walk along even you are not hotel quests.. still have fishermen boats around it"
duke167,New York,Dec 2017,"a very long beach with clean sand and water, red flag is on so we didn't swim.In the early morning low tide time, I see people can walk really far away from the beach."
Madhusudan S,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2017,Should visit if in nusa dua. Good for sunbathing. Not very crowded.You can also rey water sports at the beach
Cycorp,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Have been to Nusa Dua Beach numerous times over the years and there are exceptional areas as well as just basic areas.One of the better ones is the beach near the Conrad Hotel.Great waters, strong waters which the kids absolutely loved!We also took the opportunity to ride a jetski which the kids thoroughly enjoyed. The ‚Äòbeach access‚Äô for the Grand Whiz hotel was mostly rocky. "
Natalie P,"Mermaid Beach, Australia",Dec 2017,"I don't think you go to the Bali for the beaches as there are whiter and cleaner in the world.  But as far as Bali goes, this one is pretty good.  I actually wenrt swimming in it.  Much cleaner than Kuta or Seminyak. Quiet and calm."
Jeffrey51,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2017,Very warm water but not too deep.  Good access to all the hotels for refreshments  Be careful we did see a snake on the beach /surf last night
19bugzie60,18 contributions,Dec 2017,"Dropped into Nusa Dua for a quick swim, beaches were clean and the water was crystal clear, surprisingly not crowded. A cold Bintang at the Fleet Bar made the day."

eglobal2015,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"Wide stretches of fine white sand. Clean.Clear sea. Shallow for distanceYet can have variety of water sports, e.g. surfingNo wonder it is world famous"
ben_41071,4 contributions,Dec 2017,"It 's a beautifull beach we just need 10 minutes to find it by bike. It' a great place to visit. While enjoy the beach, we can have some food in the left or rightside waroengs. Sure we will coming again!"
raymolbert1,"Delray Beach, FL",Dec 2017,"This was a beautiful and quiet beach. Water is clear and there were surfers out on the waves. When we went it was rainy and the sea was rough, but we still enjoyed it. I would recommend! "
tigerchik,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2017,"Loved Nusa Dua beach, recommend going to Agendaz on the Beach...awesome food, service and music!! Lovely spot to just take in the views."
Mihkel T,"Tallinn, Estonia",Dec 2017,"Some of the beaches in Bali are guite polluted with garbage (its not the fault of balinese, but their countrymen somewher in the north who dump their stuff into th ocean). Nusa Dua Beach is so far the cleanest I've seen here and also there are not so many people trying to sell you stuff that you actually don't want to buy. "
Roscoe G,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2017,Lovely beach and great location. Cleanest we've seen. All allowed to use beach but loungers and shade mostly for hotel guests use only.  No other sun loungers for public to rent. Had drinks and pizza at Melia resort just to sit and watch the ocean and try to spot mount agung through the clouds. Would be a great view if not for overcast weather 
Paul M,"Williamstown, Australia",Nov 2017,Great beach area with lots of hotels. Many places to have massage ora cool drink or snack. Will return.
hd19741,england,Dec 2017,The hotels in Nusa Dua are all excellent with good beach front locations and good restaurants.If you want a more authentic Balinese experience I would recommend the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel as it is the original hotel with beautiful Balinese structures and facilities.The beach is always clean and the local sellers are all controlled. The nearby Bali Collection of shops and restaurants is a 15 minute walk away and provide a good shopping experience.
Farici,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"This beautiful beach spot is very clean with white sand, and also have a bicycle/jogging track, and beautiful view while sunrise"
Viking,"Boksburg, South Africa",Dec 2017,"A truly incredible beach with Crystal clear water and Mt. Agung as a backdrop. We were at the Sofitel Nusa Dua hotel, so we were also supplied with cold refresher towels regularly. The beach is very clean too. "
Lida H,5 contributions,Dec 2017," Beautiful scenery with clean beach.. very near to our bali nusa dua hotel, can easily reach the beach by walking"
ÏòÅÎ°ùÌëú,"Incheon, South Korea",Jun 2017,very nice and beautiful place to take restthere are lots of beautiful spots and nice restaurants !!
VirgoQualitySeeker47,Australia,Nov 2017,"Lovely beach, back of beach nr Hyatt has trees and loungers for guests only. There are security guards on duty.There are people trying to sell watches, sarongs, etc., which is a bit of a nuisance. There are more hotels further along the beach which are less quiet."
caddyandbellA,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2017,No wonder people choose to holiday here with their children.Very quiet and clean waters on pristine sand beaches.Lots of exploring to do with tourist lookouts to Mt Agung.
AnkurThakuria,33 contributions,Nov 2017,It's one of the most popular beaches in Bali. The only downside being its flocked all day around. Some great food places here as well and its close to the city center.
Yeremia P,Indonesia,Dec 2017,"Definitely enjoy this beach more than Kuta, Legian, Seminyak area. The beach is quite and close to many luxury hotels in Nusa Dua. They also offer water sports."
George_mile,20 contributions,Dec 2017,"peninsula island is very nice palce to do an exercise because it has very clean area and the air is very fresh,very recommended place to relax ,and that it's very close with water blow,which water blow is famous place in nusa dua with his big waves then crashing into the rock."
Kathy121212,"Worcester, UK",Nov 2017,"As we were guests at the Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, we used their private beach club facilities - sunbeds and bar/restaurant. There are toilet and shower facilities too. The beach is walkable distance from the hotel and as it was mid-November (so cloudier and no searing heat), it made for a pleasant stroll via the shopping mall to pick up some beers! As other reviewers have highlighted, the sea go out some way at low tide, but the beach is clean and ideal for paddling if you don't fancy the hike to the breakers!"
roger-husly,9 contributions,Dec 2017,This is one of the famous beach in Bali. So many people coming here. The place is so beautifull and clean. I come here with my family. My children was very happy playing in the sands and swimming in the beach. We will come again.. 
amin a,25 contributions,Oct 2017,"The beach in Nusa Dua have no sunset because its positition, they have a great sunriseThe sands is fullfill with rock so u must extra carefull for walk there and the wave in the beach is calm and the water is clear so you can see alot of little fish arround...But if u stay in hotel with a private beach is gonna give an advantage"
Dawncg,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"A lovely clean beach , shallow waters for swimming .  There are lots of activities if that's your thing. "
Sergii C,"Sanur, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Stayed with my family at the end of September. Very nice hotel, friendly staff. My daughter enjoyed kids pool so much, that it was very hard to get her out of it. We will definitely come back and stay longer."
squerpans,22 contributions,Dec 2017,"it really is a great place, a very unique atmosphere, I love being in this place and the natural scenery makes me comfortable"
Matt G,"Tilbury, UK",Dec 2017,"We stayed at the Melia Bali Indonesia so we‚Äôre at the end of the beach by the peninsula. Lots of people selling stuff, all good people and not pushy at all. Happy to stand and chat even though they know you‚Äôre not interested or will leave you be if that‚Äôs your preference. Water sport is available and if you want to. I‚Äôd suggest it if you want more than a paddle you‚Äôll need a boat to go out the channel and through the break. Snorkelling is a must. Always haggle!!!"
barksbys,"Colchester, UK",Nov 2017,"The beach was beautiful, clean and a lovely walk to the water blow.The currents are strong so be aware and stay fairly shallow, you can gage this by the colour of the water. "
The Travelling Familia,"Tarneit, Australia",Nov 2017,"Loved it! The sand was white and soft, beach was clean and the water was calm.After going to Legian beach this was 100 times better and what I had expected.Stunning"
Ann-Shirley G,"Vancouver, Canada",Nov 2017,Walk the beach for exercise and pleasure.  Explore the resorts along the way.  Take a quick did to cool off.  Go shell seeking but be sure to cover up to protect from the sun.
pradnyasari,59 contributions,Nov 2017,Nice beach in nusa dua good for your relax many restaurant and shop in this area you must be come here
futbolmania999,"Beirut, Lebanon",Aug 2017,These are the beaches that indonesia is known all over about. Beautiful and Clean white sands. Its quite peaceful too as its secluded.
shrey20152015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"Clean white sand beach,gated area.Near many 5 star hotels. Beautiful views, nice blue waters, good place to spend an evening."
franzico m,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"love this place .. really love the atmosphere , not so crowded and not many local come .. the beach location is quite far from kuta or denpasar , but worth it to visited"
janefromcairns,"Cairns, Australia",Nov 2017,"Gated 5 star hotel enclave . Pretty beach , clean and safe very few people selling stuff .  I really liked staying in the area - there is less to do less restaurants etc but if you just want to hang out at your hotel then this is the area to stay . "
Dhaivat03,"Vadodara, India",Jul 2017,"Its beach where most of the water sports activity is done in Bali. Sea is quite, clean and good for water sports. Also beach is private at many places occupied by 5star resorts."
Lian Tiong G,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Nov 2017,The Nusa Dua beach is a long stretch of fine sand. Several hotels are located along the beach. Beautiful blue water as backdrop with boats make the scene pictureque. We have our morning walk along the beach and watch the sun rises as early as 5.30 am.
pilypop,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Nov 2017,"Literally the ONLY beach in Bali that isn‚Äôt covered in rubbish and is also cool to do a bit of snorkeling. Also the only beach that isn‚Äôt unpleasant to get to, most beaches I‚Äôve visited here have messy paths to get down to a very small beach littered with trash and are a mission to find and not worth it. Nusa Dua is definitely worth visiting! "
Vanessa T,2 contributions,Nov 2017,Lovely beach Clean & today A few bars & hotels to walk around Views stunning Security managing most areas 
F3753MHhelenp,4 contributions,Nov 2017,The water is very clean except for the seaweed...I watched them clean the sand and what they do is rake the seaweed and then dig holes on the beach to bury it in...I think this is why there seems to be more seaweed some days compared to others because depending on the tide washing it back in. The Balinese selling their wares on the beach dont bother you..once you say no they walk away unlike Kuta and other places in Bali..compared to Seminyak and Kuta the beach in Nusa Dua wins by far...it is also a beautiful walk after dinner along the foreshore past all the other hotels with elegant bars on the beach and restaurants.
SanWa Journeys,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Everytime we went to Bali, we always looked for a beach without so much crowded and had a glimpse of white sand. So the decision was always Nusa Dua which also near to the town and airport. We, especially me, always love being there.But of course we could not see sunset in this part of Bali. And it was and is always windy although sunny."
Liz T,"Leigh, UK",Nov 2017,"The beach is long with great sand and shallow water to swim in. The only downside to this beach is it is noisy with so many jet skis, paragliders, banana boats etc whizzing up and down"
elies2017,"Beveridge, Australia",Nov 2017,Pristine beach with very clear clean water and lovely rolling waves with enchanting views of nusa lembongan and nusa penda the refreshing water was a joy to swim in.
Van V,7 contributions,Nov 2017,"Very clean beach, sand was nice and the water was always warm. Great atmosphere,    Very spacious beach "
yorosey,"Las Vegas, NV",Nov 2017,Was impressed with for how the most part it was clean. Great to walk along or go for a swim. Sunrise and low tide is a nice combination as well.
Azur S,"Southport, Australia",Nov 2017,"Great Dine! Professional Service!I can't believe words can express how great the dish here. Everything is amazing. Beside of the beautiful-look food served, they taste really good. The flavour of seasoning, freshness, and the ambience are blended beautifully. Needless to say, the service was uniformly excellent, professional, and attentive. The place is nice and quiet, elegantly furnished, and so classy. I don't really matter the price noted, the food has blinded me satisfyingly."
Priyankara D,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Nov 2017,"This place is really calm and suitable for swimmers. I spent more than 4 hours in water and had so much fun with friends. Specially, the sea is wide and safe with soft waves, You will enjoy a lot!"
Ojassy,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"As expected when you're in a posher area, beach is clean but waves abit strong during our visit. Long stretches of white sands, not much happening besides relaxing. There's a Shangri Las hotel under construction by the beach that's something to look forward to."
tripguy045,australia,Nov 2017,"For all of the carry on about how good bali is, i can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm too impressed. Sydney has some of the best beaches in the world, so I‚Äôm probably spoiled for choice back home.The only positive thing I have to say is that with a young daughter who is a a little afraid of waves, the water is very calm and presents almost no danger."
William H,"Wakefield, UK",Nov 2017,"Currently staying at the Melia Bali , right on the beautiful and Peaceful Nusa Dua beach. The beach is spotlesley clean and free of many jet skis (only seen 1 in 10 days) there is plenty of water sports if needed as a there is a man walking around with prices but isn't at all pushy. He just radios to the next bay if anyone needs anything.There are possibly 6 sellers who walk around awaiting yr wave , they leave you alone straight away if you say no thanks. Each hotel has security guards at their entrance and peace and quiet is their priority so a peaceful day is guaranteed. "
mpatoga,"Ourense, Spain",Nov 2017,"We were in The Mulia hotel and with direct access to the beach. Nice,clean and beautiful. Not noisy and safe beach.  What else you need?"
Jessica W,"Rosetown, Canada",Nov 2017,This beach was quiet. It had some seaweed in the water and the sand had a lot of shells. It wasn‚Äôt the best beach I have ever been to but it was alright. The water was calm close to shore. 
yinic,"Atlanta, GA",Nov 2017,Expensive place to stay and eat. Then you may have to leave the site to find great local eats. Too many chain restaurantsYou can stay off the beach and just come for the day visit.
mobydick59,"Broadbeach, Australia",Oct 2017,access difficult Lots of painful pebbles .. Not the best beach. We have better beaches in Australlia
Bojanaaa,49 contributions,Oct 2017,"For me, since I‚Äôm not the surfer type this was far the best beach on Bali, nice white sand with blue water like from postcards... in some areas the tide gets really low so it doesn‚Äôt look very nice, but overall beautiful beach,not crowded at all. Only thing that is somehow inconvenient is that all the nice resorts are here so if ur not stayin there u‚Äôll just have to grab a towel and stay on the sand, still u can use the beach bar and restaurant from some of the resorts which is ok, if u want to get out of the sun and stay in the shade for a bit"
Heather R,16 contributions,Nov 2017,Nice beach although sun beds a little ad hoc. Also some rubbish in the water which is a shame. Comes to life at night but not amazing in the day
√òystein V,"Tysnes, Norway",Nov 2017,"Great beach, but not the best for swimming. Low water level even at high tide. In low tide the water will almost dissapear completely. Very beautiful and kids friendly."
Marta P,10 contributions,Oct 2017,"Such a great beach! Beautiful view of volcano, spectacular sunsets and great restaurant all around where you can chill out and still enjoy the views."
karenchristelle,66 contributions,Nov 2017,We got here at about 10am and it was still quiet and peaceful. The beach was still cool and breezy. You can easily walk around and see both sides of the beaches. Many resorts around too but i did not stay in any one of them. We spent about 40 minutes here before heading on to our next tour spots. Worth a stop!
alison h,"Nuneaton, UK",Oct 2017,"Clean, safe beach and although there were people selling goods, they did not hassle you if you made it clear you did not intend buying anything."
Serene S,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,Nusa Dua is undeniably one of the prettiest beach in Bali and it was very calming to see a clear blue skies. Even found some puppies to play with! The only thing that surprised me was that there was some littering but not outside of the hotel I was staying at but towards the other resort.
Angelique C,Trinidad,Oct 2017,"This beach is lovely, it has many hotels on the length of the Beach. There is also the Water Blow that you can visit close by- I suggest that you go when its high tide. "
sunhasan,"Mississauga, Canada",Sep 2017,"A very good place for watersports. Look for Arjun watersports. Reasonable, negotiable, donot compromise on any activity. Superb scuba trainers, all other activities including parasailing, jetskiing etc, very good. Try going early morning. "
Let's Go Sightseeing,"Noida, India",Jul 2017,This beach is famous for water sports but these are quite expensive. The facilities are well provided for though. The beach itself needs a little more cleanliness.
SMYTHTRIBE,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,We love the beaches at Nusa dua. With various little lagoons and varying scenery they are far nicer in my opinion than seminyak. 
Napeer,2 contributions,Oct 2017,"Had nice facilities for watersports. But need to bargain with service providers.  We experienced Sea walker for the first time, it was really nice"
Gourlaybankterriers,"East Lothian, UK",Oct 2017,"Well kept, lovely long and wide beach.. staff at Grand Bali Hyat keep their area very well maintained and clean, much appreciated"
_Raven_4,"Whistler, Canada",Oct 2017,It was beautiful! They will not rent out boards some days until 2pm because the tide is so low at times.  
griszkon,Poland,Apr 2017,"Beach is beautiful and very long. The only thing is that when you try to get into the water you have to wade through the junk buffer. They clean it very offer but still lots of rubbish comes out.Anyway, this place is very nice and I would love to go back there."
Reza R,"Vancouver, Canada",Nov 2017,As the tides go and return couple times a day its nice to walk in the shallow water and see lots of fish and crabs.
Swati T,9 contributions,Oct 2017,We did sea walk and parasailing at this beach. It was great fun. Didn‚Äôt really spend time on the beach though but I think this is the only beach worth going to. Others are pretty mediocre.
Ontracc,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"If you like a quieter atmosphere then this is worth the time to visit. Away from the hussle of Kuta and Seminyak, Nusa Dua beach offers luxury hotels, bars and plenty of shade to relax in and just let the day roll by. We strolled from pirates bay to the north along the beach Promenade stopped at Tamarind for lunch and a drink, see seperate review. High end hotels and clean beaches with viewd to Lombok island. Best suited for families with children and anyone who wants a relaxing hassle free holiday.Prices will be higher here for most things so get a great hotel deal early for off season value. It's worth it."
david l,"1,937 contributions",Oct 2017,"I am inspired by the designers of each beach spot of the five star hotels.   To walk somewhere different.  To take risk.  What ever people eating near the beach, should wake up the next morning thinking about the symphony of fine dishes with humming of waves.  The experience shows what a great rambling could be.  "
Blunden123,"Basingstoke, UK",Oct 2017,"Stayed at one of the hotels backing on to Nusa Dua beach.  It is a very long beach with safe swimming areas marked by buoys. The waves are small, so you can go to water and swim. When the tide is out you can walk a fair way out in safety.A quiet beach, that is ideal to relax and chill out on."
Pritesh M,"Leamington Spa, UK",Aug 2017,"From the hotel we were able to get on to the beach. It is clean and very pleasant. Only thing is that the low comes from midday onwards so if you miss it, you'll have to wait till the morning. Also, there are a lot of activity peddlers on the beach. They are good, but sometimes it does get annoying when you are trying to relax."
Elaine L,"Mount Samson, Australia",Oct 2017,"A lovely beach with clean, white sand and clear water to swim in. Very pleasant to take a stroll along and not too many hawkers to bother you. Very nice. "
Shivani P,6 contributions,Sep 2017,"So one thing you need to know about Nusa Dua (I didnt know this when I visited) is that in the afternoon time, the water goes WAY in away from the beach line making it impossible to swim in. However, this changes around 4pm in the evening when the water comes back. The best beaches to visit are definitely Geger beach, however it is very crowded and pretty expensive of you dont stay in the Mulia resort. From my personal experience, unfortunately we only discovered this on the last day, is the beach where the Pirate's Bay resort is on. On this beach, not only is it very free and un-crowded, you get the best beach chairs! We had this circle purple beds and they were the most comfortable relaxing beds ever. Theyre not even that expensive. Dont waste you time going to a beach infront of a hotel unless you're staying in that beach front hotel. On the whole, Nusa Dua beaches are definitely the best Bali has to offer. "
Sameer Nandan M R,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2017,"The beach falls towards the south western end of the Bali. A stip of land with blue water beaches on two sides. For an ideal swim and a nap on the sands, suggest the right side beach when facing the statues. The left side beach is more an activity beach. Do NOT miss the water blow that lies behing the big statue. It would be one amazing experience"
Hettie1956,"Sheffield, UK",Oct 2017,The views at night are so beautiful.  Either sitting at the Arawana restaurant or the kul kul  bar just breath taking. 
Tony D,"Sandton, South Africa",Oct 2017,Water very low at low tide so get there when at least half way or walk along beach to operate as. But good beach. Safe for bathing
denis,"Rockland,Ontario,Canada",Oct 2017,The hotel (Bali Nusa Dua)gave us free coupons to get free access to lounge chairs. We arrived around ten and we were only a few other tourists on the beach. Very few vendors
Kamikaze4,"Yarra, Australia",Oct 2017,We have been to Bali over 5times and normally stayed in Seminyak however we wanted to try a new area. Nusa Dua beach is very lovely. Relax beach with no hustle. Not many people try to sell you products. However there were no public toilets there so you have to pay to use a toilet in a shop and they will charge you. 
MegSar,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Very clean beach, much nicer than Legian ect. Water is calm, good for children, however sometimes there is a strong rip. The beach is lovely to take a nice walk. There aren‚Äôt any people interrupting you by selling/bartering with you, the odd offer for a massage which is lovely on the hotel lounges. Very relaxing. Short 30min drive from Legian. "
Daria K,22 contributions,Oct 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is very long and not too much people on the beach. Waves are small, so you can go to water and swim, if you decided to surf, you will find a place too - waves are not too big, but still you can learn and try to catch it just a little bit away from a beach side. Recommend! "
Sarah C,23 contributions,Oct 2017,Very lovely beach. The sand is very white and there are a lot of happy tourists. Not many locals trying to sell things which is a nice break from other parts of Bali. 
Vackor78,"Budapest, Hungary",Oct 2017,"Beautiful beach , clean water, hotels ‚Äò private beaches but offers water sports activities. Not crowded , beautiful shore. "
Tushar P,23 contributions,Oct 2017,It's a clean beach with few people but lots of rock.No shacks and no beer.Not like the vast beaches we generally see due to rocks.Lots of surfers and one can have a beautiful view of sunrise. 
Venture736582,15 contributions,Oct 2017,Nice beach in Bali..  Can't ask more than that..  Water is very very clean and crystalline...  There are a lot of turist but is OK... Childrens enjoy all beautiful day
TuukkaT,"Vaasa, Finland",Oct 2017,"We spend two weeks in Nusa Dua with a family of five. The area is totally made for tourists and therefore it feels really safe, clean and comfortable. Of course it is a lot more pricey than Bali in general but with small children it is worth every penny. You can also relax in peace in the resorts which is nice compared to other areas where the vendors are quite pushy."
mohsen_rio,"Shiraz, Iran",Oct 2017,I think nusa dua beach is beautiful and cleaner than the other.i recommend if you want relax and silent.but if you want activity i recommend kuta beach.
nykbbnyy,"Brooklyn, NY",Oct 2017,Went to the public area of this beach.Found a spot with lots of space with no one around but then we found out why. The water here was filled with garbage. Lots and lots of it and not just small pieces but big pieces of plastic. We moved to a different part where more people were and it was much cleaner but still some garbage in the water and sand. When I walked the beach I saw there were people cleaning in some spots but other laces were pretty filthy. Very unfortunate and I'm sure the bigger hotels try to keep their sections clean.The water was nice and calm for swimming but just too much garbage to recommend anyone visit.
carrosau,"Barwon Heads, Australia",Oct 2017,"A lovely beach, clear and clean and a nice path to walk along, linking hotels. Only a few free standing restaurants but look out for Pirate's Bay a great restaurant where you sit in treehouses and get served lovely cheap food."
Nick A,"Bronx, NY",Oct 2017,"Absolutely a fantastic beach! Very clean! This place is really protected and taken care of by the government, main tourist attraction! The resorts here are all top notch and offer different feel and amenities, male sure and do your home work!The water is gorgeous, so clear!"
rachel z,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Yellow sand (not black like other beaches). and clean, clear beautiful water to swim in . When the tide starts to go down the water is just gorgeous to sit in for hours."
Amrit C,"Auckland, New Zealand",Oct 2017,The Beachfront lines a number of high end resorts. Its clean and secure with no hawkers etc. You can walk all the way down it to Bali Collection..
T S,"Jupiter, FL",Oct 2017,Not really great for swimming. Lots of watersports catering to tour groups at the far end. OK for a walk but must walk through a hotel or business to get to the beach.

Janenebabe,7 contributions,Oct 2017,"Was extremely shocked to find the waters edge filled with rubbish - as we walked along we noticed that the cleanness areas to swim are in front of the top hotels eg: club med who take pride in cleaning the beachfront of their hotel. Nusa Dua beach was lovely and quiet with no annoying sales people approaching you with goods like seminyak beach. The sand itself is coral, so sand shoes are a must. Lovely sheltered temples to relax under along the beach . There are also market stalls of clothes and the prices were cheaper than seminyak or ubud. "
Sara S,"Herzliya, Israel",Oct 2017,"Very dirty - honestly dont understand what the fuss is about, Bali has more beautiful beaches! Try swimming with yoghurt cups, lots of plastic and plastic bags... disguisting. Time for travellers to take more responsibility over the impact we make on the places that we are visiting..."
Trav√§la711,"Nairobi, Kenya",Jun 2017,"The price of alcoholic drinks and cigarettes on the beach can be negotiated. The boat trip organizers and masseuses on the beach will try every few hours to get you to have a massage. Avoid saying yes if you don‚Äôt intend to, because they get offended."
Jaime A,"Montreal, Canada",Nov 2016,"Such a beautiful beach, in such a beautiful country.... Fell in love with Bali from minute one! Would (and will!) return the very first chance I have enough time to travel to the South Pacific. Indonesia, thank you! (Jaime Alcaraz Montreal)"
melindawisetyo,Jakarta,Jul 2017,"Compared to other beach in Bali, Nusa Dua Beach is my favorite. It's clean and blue beach with white sandy beach. Not too crowded, perfect to chill and do sunbathing."
Nitesh Bhopalka,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2017,Nusa Dua beach is full of luxury hotels and almost look like dram destination. Clean beach and very less crowded 
Luka B,"Logatec, Slovenia",Sep 2017,"Ideal for surfing - beginers, there are many surfing schols, nice sand beach, not nice beach after 14.00 because of low tide..."
stumpy1954,"Grays Thurrock, UK",Oct 2017,"As previously submitted, this resort is of a very high standard, and we have already decided that we will be returning in a couple of years"
marybe21,"Ripon, UK",Oct 2017,"Lovely beach, beware that this is mainly because at high tide the waves are broken away from the beach leaving still clear water close to the beach. At low tide this empties leaving little water and seaweed close to the beach. We loved the paddle boarding. "
Grahame N,"Charlestown, Australia",Sep 2017,"Great alternative to the multiple pools available in the resort.The beach activities were fun, jet skis (woo hoo).  We all enjoyed immensely.  Plenty of places to relax with many chairs and day beds.  The beach bar was over used."

Francois R,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",Oct 2017,Nice smooth sand but sadly there is always litter coming in from the ocean. You can go for nice long walks which was great.
Tadela W,"West Stockholm, NY",Sep 2017,This beach is a local beach very quiet and beautiful. The locals are so sweet the food on the beach is cheap and tasty. The only down side is there was a lot of Europeans that showed up late in the day. 
mechen121,"Taipei, Taiwan",Oct 2017,"The location is inside Nusa Dua. A great place to visit and advised to bring the family along. Beautiful beach to spend the afternoon, while waiting for the waves."
Vedna B,"Durban, South Africa",Oct 2017,"Breathtakingly beautiful! Crystal clear with shades of blue, white sand, spectacular, flat water, you can lay there and float away. Best beach experience yet!"
Mark B,2 contributions,Sep 2017,"This beach fronts home many Nusa dua hotels which make avaliable sun loungers to it's patrons, although this luxuary is not avaliable to the public beach which is the smaller of two bays that make up the Nusa Dua beaches. The sand of these beches is soft although a little harsher under foot neare the water. The sea deapth was relatively shallow even at high tide during our stay at a metre or less,although the public beach side has some deeper areas in it's bay, but both sides may be a little higher at different moon phases. Both beaches have reefs at there fronts edges which makes them shallow in the main, and thus no significant waves to catch you out.  With it's palm fringed front and soft sands it is has the idilic feel a long haul holiday/honeymoon has to make you feel good."
the travelling tradie,"Warners Bay, Australia",Oct 2017,"Crystal clear waters and white sand! Very nice beach. Activities available all down the beach, clean water(no rubbish around) and a bunch of flash resorts to stop in for a drink "
anon888385,"Lithgow, Australia",Sep 2017,"Water on the beach was pristine, blue and clear, looked incredible. Visited other beaches around Bali whilst sight seeing and none of them topped the beach at Nusa Dua. Only down side being a few pieces of rubbish that had washed up or been thrown there, but still a lot less then any other beaches. Beautiful to swim in on a hot day when the pools aren't enough. "
SPH63,"Boundary, UK",Sep 2017,Fabulos beach no shale or sroney beach sand sand sand .very shallow only up to waist high for a great way out only then does it get deeper.not alot of fish about so not great for snorkling gotta get a boat to take you out further for that.cafe is great have your food at the bar we found it got cold by the time it took to get to the beach at the cafe you got good food drinks ciggies some snacks .food was always fresh cooked from what i could see and had .never had bali beli .toilets basic :but unisex as the day goes on they do smell and dont get cleaned regulary.enough.Sunbeds get there early only 100 idr for two all day .prices go up as the beach fills .beach vendours once told no they didnt bother us again .massage highly recommend it yiann also known as numder 5 amazing lady 200idr for full body best money spent all holiday .Taxis get the local blue or blue bird dont get the others your likely to get ripped off the bar will even get you one.
Virginia W,4 contributions,Sep 2017,Beautiful white soft sand with clear warm water.  Safe for swimming.  Lovely gentle breeze all day.  We think this is the best beach in Bali and we have visited and stayed in many different areas of Bali
mark b,"Dana Point, CA",Oct 2017,Just returned from Bali. Beaches and water are perfect.  Areas where beach is not groomed have lots of trash but not in front of the hotels
vamsi111,"Hyderabad, India",Oct 2017,The beach is not so great as the waters are very still and there are hardly any waves. There are many luxurious resorts around and people just cool their heels. Everything here is expensive and the best part we liked is water blow. There are lot of cultural events that take place. Food s great. We can see the far islands nusa lemboghan and penida from here. Bargain to half for the water sports. 
Richa84,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2017,Oh and avoid the sea urchin. Not great for any swimming activity as there are too many reeds the whole way round the pennisula
Anthony J,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is very nice with white sand although with only very small waves. Most of this beach area is very relaxing, with less bogan tourists (that you will find at Kuta beach) and more Europeans. Also, unlike Kuta Beach there's less locals trying to sell you souvenirs and massages, which makes for a more relaxing and peaceful experience. The water here appears much cleaner than Kuta as well. The only down side is that this side of the island gets the sunrise instead of the beautiful sunset that you get on the other side. But, if your goal is just to relax without being bothered then this is the beach for you."
cliffandjo,"Wroughton, UK",Oct 2017,Nusa Dua beach area has many locations.  If you access from the Bali Collection area you can get onto the beach in front of the hotels but it's not great.  Best public access is in the Geger Beach area or walk through the St Regis and park up on the sand by their bar.  Most of the good beach areas are in front of hotels.  Don't be intimidated by the security guys just be cool and make your way where you want to go and use the hotel facilities for refreshment and loos !!  
Franki1213,4 contributions,Sep 2017,"Lovely,clean beach with only small waves,perfect for relaxing without plenty of swimming to do. The only thing it misses is the sunset,which is on the other side of the island."
Marie R,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Nusa Dua beach is a beautiful beach with crystal clear water and white sand. Very good for families.  It is a very quiet and safe place and very relaxing.  I will recommend  to ho thete if you are in Nusa Dua.  There is lots of trees to relax under if you dont want to stay under the sun all day.Very nice view too.Marie
458krishnad,"Warangal, India",Oct 2017,"It was a lovely evening we decided to visit the Nusa Dua beach. The beach front itself has been completely developed, with numerous shopping complexes, beach clubs, Bali Collection (mall) all at the same place. The water is clean and shallow. Not much current so it is safe for young kids."
Richard K,21 contributions,Sep 2017,Beautiful beach spotlessly clean with a path running along it with was a lovely walk with we did not than once 
bleketepluk,3 contributions,Sep 2017,White clean sand.. Not good for sunset. Sunrise view only.. Some part of the beach exclusively for 3 hotels. There's not much of souvenir/gift shop
John White,"Saltash, UK",Sep 2017,Beach is just beautiful & ideally located next to perfect hotel in the laguna luxury collection. Secure & safe with lovely golden sand.
jc26_11,"Langkawi, Malaysia",Sep 2017,One of the cleanest beaches in Bali water wise but the broken bits of coral make it hard to swim. Need water shoes. Subject to high and low tide so swimming is subject to high tide. Very pretty beach.
madeinIndonesia,"Montreal, Canada",Sep 2017,apart from kuta and legian here is more quit. you wont have street seller try to offer you food or massage which sometimes it kind of bothered. 
Giuseppe C,"Bristol, UK",Apr 2017,Nusa Dua is good soft sand large beach in Bali the water is warm and clear but is not calm there are strong currents that pull you across and if you you are not a strong swimmer then it would be a struggle.For so called paradise I expect more.Walking along the costal path toward the Regis and Mula hotels the water is calmer but then it's hindered by shingles and pebbles.It's not the best beach I have been to what really lets it down is the tide will go out in the early afternoon leaving the beach a lot less enjoyable.It's quiet even with the hotels there's not alot of people for the amount of space there is also safe.
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2017,Nusa dua public beach is a beautiful quiet beach in Bali. The sea is beautiful. It's not to far from Seminyak and Kuta area. Here less beach sellers than Kuta.
willski2016,28 contributions,Sep 2017,One of the best beaches i have visited plenty of things to do lot of water sports jet ski/paddle bording/speed boats nice place to relax and just enjoy life you don't seemed to get hassle by people trying to sell you stuff like most other places 5*
mchrst490,Doncaster,Sep 2017,Nice white sand but the tide goes out early so in the afternoon the sea has gone well out. Not the paradise beach I was expecting.
Christopher L,"Bogangar, Australia",Sep 2017,"Awesome place to go for a stroll, plenty of sites and sounds.  I especially like how quiet it is.  Not to many merchants selling stuff."
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,This has to be one of the most beautiful beaches in Bali. It's good to visit with family and for a romantic time away from the all the party beaches. It is home to some good hotel chains and luxury shopping. The water sports here are really good. 
Stephen G,"Limerick, Ireland",Sep 2017,"The beach itself has lovely golden sand. The tide does go out a way and when it is in the water is quite shallow but a nice temperature (September anyway). Great to go in and cool off or for paddle-boarding, which seems quite popular.We never found it too crowded. Very safe for children due to depth and no strong currents (that I was aware of) possibly due to the reef.Worth a  visit"
amos.sd,"Nice, France",Sep 2017,"Just wow... Everyone visiting Bali should go to Nusa Dua seaside. Just try and see, you will be amazed!"
AHViking,"Trogir, Croatia",Sep 2017,"Nice beach but the tide makes the currents strong. Some places it's like being in a rapid river. The resorts have restaurants by the beach front. Public access several places, but the sun beds are reserved for resorts guests. Places to rent equipment for water activities."
C T,"Main Beach, Australia",Sep 2017,We loved this resort hotel. Positioned along the Nusa Dua Beach area and close to other resorts. Beach area is spectacularly clean and without hawkers.
maggietynan,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,"Beautiful beaches - most day beds are controlled by the hotels along the strip.  A great walk along the beachfront - many couples having wedding photos - eg 5 at a time - all during the day.  Hawkers keep their distance and you can have massages on the beach - either organized by the hotels at a price, or much cheaper on the actual beach. Sand is white, ocean perfect and many delightful restaurants to have a bite to eat with squirrels in the trees overhead"
Afterdark1400,"Isfahan, Iran",Sep 2017,"Super beach!The Laguna hotelI liked the relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and hospitality of Bali people."
Wayne W & J,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,"Lovely hotel and staff, had Scoopon voucher which was great stayed in pool access room, very far from everything,shops etc, but perfect if you want peace. Pools awesome and huge, spa in hotel expensive but well worth the price, staff there definitely know how to give a great massage. Very friendly and helpful team. "
Angryangmo,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"Most parts of Nusa Duas long coast line are divided up into parcels, belonging to the multiple hotel resorts, making them their private beaches, however they all have one thing in common, while there are plenty of beautiful and relaxing lounge chairs available, if you want to actually go into the water for a swim, consider going to another beach.There were tons of sharp rocks and pebles making it a painful process to get into the water, and the water itself wasnt really clear / nice, as on other beaches, not to speak of the dream like ones of Thailand."
vipula m,"Northampton, UK",Sep 2017,Beautiful clean beach White sand Lovely place to relax Mist of the beach is exclusive to the hotels but there is some areas where you can useGet hassled by the sellers
btnpete,"Brighton, UK",Sep 2017,"Beautiful beach with plenty of shade. The beach is clean and quiet, there are beach sellers here but if you are not interested no hassle from them. The sea is also clean however there is only certain times that you can swim as the sea goes out a long way. But there are several pools of shallow water where you can submerge to cool off "
Gopi nath,243 contributions,Jul 2017,"Nusa dua beach is a clam beach with not much of waves. This is good for relaxation and water sports or activities.If you want waves, then this beach is not the right place. My son also found a star fish at this beach."
Wilhelm_Polinski,"Kassel, Germany",Sep 2017,One of the best beaches in bali ! We stayed 2 weeks at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa and it was amazing!No Sunset here but in the early mornings you can see a beautiful Sunrise !!!
Steve D,"Kersbrook, Australia",Sep 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is a great beach for families. The water is very safe for little kids. If you're coming from another part of Bali make sure you check when it's high tide and plan on arriving 1.5 hours before so you can enjoy the water for the maximum amount of time. The tide goes out a long way. If you have time, hire a bike. There is a track which runs along the beach all the way to Benoa with some great views of the resorts. It is interesting to check out how the rich and famous are spending their Bali time."
PNMG,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,"Small beach , where the sea water is warm but shallow . With low tide , it's like a bathtub , we can't swim . Great for small children ."
skpatel,"Vadodara District, India",Mar 2017,"Very beautiful beach , so many visitors,  you really feel that you are enjoying vacation.  So many well-known hotels and resorts and restaurants . You can enjoy local shopping "
Exploration66293,14 contributions,Sep 2017,Quiet beach with access controlled by neighbouring resorts. No hawkers and a very comfortable environment if visiting solo. Beaches weren't patrolled on the day visited which is why I rated 4 rather than 5. 
BlueTravelMagnet,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2017,The view at the south end of the Nusa Dua Beach is stunning and we enjoyed the same by taking tons of pictures. The water can get quite shallow and thus one may need to walk little bit towards the sea but it is definitely worth it. The colour of the water and sand are something I loved watching. Must visit when in South Bali¬†
Kevin S,5 contributions,Aug 2017,The beach is pristeen and safe although too shallow to swim. At low tide you get to walk out to the reef that completely protects the bay. There are a few vendors in the beach but they are friendly and not overly pushy.
Theo,"Enfield, UK",Aug 2017,"We stopped here for a few hours early in the morning and the place wowed me. Id been to a few other beaches around bali and they all seemed to underwhelm but this is what i thought when i though Bali beaches.Golden sand, calm clear waters and the surrounding views are gorgeous. picture opportunity after picture opportunity. Maybe because of the time we got there (around 8:30am) but the place was nice and chilled and still was by the time we left and had a much more laid back vibe to the other beaches i had been.Definitely worth a visit"
555steve,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"Great beach always clean and well kept as it mostly adjoins the name branded hotels etc. At low tide walk out and look at the exposed reef, at high tide you can get your fill of water sports like jet sking, paragliding etc etc. For the family a lot better than Kuta as you don't get waves breaking and the rips and sweeps that are dangerous and come with the breaking waves."
Diane A,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Water is turquoise and calm during low tide. The view is spectacular and beach is clean! Just gorgeous 
platinuuum,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Sep 2017,"Great for couples or families ! A piece of paradise, very affordable. We stayed closed to Ayodya hotel beach, and rented beach chairs and towels for 500k each. We did some snorkeling, and though it's not a recommended spot, I saw a huge snapper, tons of blue spine unicorn fishes and the usual tropical crowd ! For water sports, ask for putu ""chinky monkey"" kamput at the Ayodya beach bar. He will give you cheap price and awesome time !!"
Kin P,15 contributions,Aug 2017,"Quite beach located off several brand name hotels. Plenty of space to soak in the sun, build sand castles or take a dip or swim.  Relatively calm waters."
Jane B,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,This beach is nice and clean although there are signs warning of sea urchins at low tide. Plenty of water sports here and a well maintained path that goes from the Bali Collective down past the resorts.
TeignmouthAsh,"Teignmouth, UK",Sep 2017,"The beach is beautiful golden sand, it isnt fine sand though. We loved it. The only downside is that there is a reef just of shore, when the tide goes out you are left with very shallow water out to the reef. To get there and in to swimable water on the other side you need to wade through a forest of sea weed. We didnt see many fish, which was surprising. We did sea a Banded Sea Krait though, a highly poisonous snake which gives a lethal bite!All in all we really enjoyed it, but after seeing the beaches at Seminyak, Ulawatu and Pdang Pdang, we wont be coming back"
iveronikaa,"Oslo, Norway",Aug 2017,"It was a very nice beach, but not very special or diffrent. The water was clean And the sand was light beige. Good place to tan And swim, but deffinetly many tourists here so it is not like a secret hideaway. Would go again."
Tumelo2K,"Gaborone, Botswana",Sep 2017,"If you're into long walks by the beach... this is your place.Beautiful, calm waters with soft sandy beaches. The water is warm and perfect for lazing in.Has a promenade where you can a walk for over 3 miles. The promenade runs through all the top beach resorts with free access so there are plenty spots to stop for a drink and admire the view.Different lagoon spots to watch the waves and enjoy the calming effects of the ocean."
Pao,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"Here is where I've chosen to take the sun. The beach was beautiful, the sand fine and white, there weren't many people specially around 10/11 am and that made it perfect. You can rent a parasol but it is also ok to take a towel or a cloth and extend it on the sand, it is safe and the sea is calm and not too deep, still you can swim and enjoy the sun."
HayleyJMatt,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"On first look, the beach looks lovely. However you really need to experience more of the island and once you have done that you will realise that Nusa Dua beach is really not the beach to be at. We had smelly camels walking up and down the beach when we were here, giving tourists rides. The camels were defiant and definitely didn't want to be walking up and down and up and down the beach all day. It just felt like I could be anywhere in the world and to top it the sand was rubbish. Do not get me wrong - the hotels along this beach are bloody fantastic.But seriously, if you thought this beach was fantastic, you obviously didn't experience enough of the rest of Bali."
Sean B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Aug 2017,Certainly spending time of this beach in high tide is fun but there is an equal experience when it is low tide as you can walk out really quite far to where the waves break.
Jack F,"Los Angeles, CA",Aug 2017,"the sand is the best and the beach is most clean in Bali. Much more quiet than the beach in Seminyak.  Overall, a great relaxing beach with spectacular views"
Luisito de Pineda de mar,19 contributions,Sep 2017,"The best holidayss ever...rom√°ntic, amazing people, cultural, relax, funny, drinks, foods, animations.....unforgetable holidayss"
Loredana B,"Bucharest, Romania",Jun 2017,"If you're going to visit Bali, don't choose Nusa Dua as your place to stay. We made that mistake and it is my biggest regret from that holiday. Although we rented a scooter and we managed to escape every day, it was not a good choice. Nusa Dua has a lot of resorts, restaurants and shops, but they are in a specific environment, you can feel that everything in there is under supervision and in a very strict conditions. Plus, everything is much more expensive than the rest of Bali. You will not have a complete balinese experience if you chose to stay there. "
Seyda,"Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany",Sep 2017,Very loooong beach with 50 shades of blue. Though it is hard to swim due to waves in the afternoon and you should check the low tide time.
Pamela M,"North Haven, Australia",Sep 2017,Very very busy beach you can't swim there as too many busts coming and going. Horse riding on the beach not a beach for relaxing best to stay in beachside resorts
Tom L,"Da Lat, Vietnam",Aug 2017,"Clean clear water, clean beach, gentle walk into the deeper water- no severe drop off, great open ocean view."
Bill,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2017,Tge beach behind the grand aston should be beautiful. Sadly it is full of rubbish inspite of the hard work by two hotel staff. Luckily the pool area was perfect so the beach can be avoided
CMcG,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2017,It was a very pretty beach.  although very shallow.  It was great watching the local fishers using the schools of black tip reef sharks to locate the fish.
Curiosity629520,15 contributions,Aug 2017,"Nothing out of the ordinary, but a good beach. Went there one afternoon and there was a low tide. Cozy beach and seems to be good for surfers. "
jayzee91,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2017,"Well Nusa Dua beach has it all. Sun lounges, some shady trees, lovely clean beach with only a couple of licensed sellers. The ocean is refreshing and clean. You can get food, drinks, beer and ice cream. The fresh coconuts are fabulous, a must try.You just have to be careful not to get sun burnt."
andrewhG2744JS,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"Beaches are totally different in Nusa Dua as compared with Kuta,Legian & Seminyak,which are the popular destinations in Bali.The beaches are fairly clean(a little rubbish on the sand and in water on some areas of the beach),the sand is white and the water is clear."
Angela Elvin,"Telford, UK",Aug 2017,"Our hotel was set on Nusa Dua beach and it is idyllic to look at. Unfortunately as water sports (jet skis, banana boats etc) are common place now the sea is polluted with petrol and oil and you can smell the fumes from the speed boat's when sunbathing. I didn't actually go into the water (no one did) presumably because of the petrol etc floating in the water. The sand is beautiful and it is a real shame that the water has been tarnished due to the popularity of motorised water sports üòû"
944jill,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Aug 2017,Tide is out from 4pm so you can walk right around the bay. Lovely. Lots of beds available but they go quickly in the mornings.
MSethi2905,"Gaborone, Botswana",Sep 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is just heaven. Calm warm ocean, clear water and beaches that are clean and well maintained. There is a üö≤ path and rentals are available at the hotels in Nusa Dua (guests only). The beach is kid friendly and has limited motor sports at the beach which creates a serene atmosphere. No tide so not a surfing beach. Ideal for sunbathing and wading. A better beach compared to Phuket, Penang and Mauritius üèñ. "
stevesudjatmiko,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"This  white sand beach is truly beautiful. I dont usually like to stay in the beach for long but this beach is just very special.The water is clean, the sand is soft, the wind blows calmly. I spent two hours doing nothing and slowly my mind and soul feel the serenity of the sea.Simply a must go beach"
Harsh Kandoi,"Budapest, Hungary",Jun 2017,It's the best because of the sheer touristy feeling of being enveloped around hundreds of 5star properties and good crowd. And thats also why it's the costliest!
Sutan,12 contributions,Sep 2017,"Been exceptional place to regenerate .There are a lot to e.g. Swimming pool, beach lovely service and food  "
Anton M,"Barwon Heads, Australia",Aug 2017,A relaxed setting with great walking paths and good services for beach growers Not heavily over developed which makes for a relaxing and restful visit Cannot fault location  
J.D. Drayton,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"White sand, crystal clear water and beautiful aqua sea! This beach is what you would expect on a tropical island getaway! The water was so warm and lovely to swim in. I didn't want to get out! You must go before the low tide as it's not the greatest when there is no water. An absolute must-see in Bali! "
Anastasia R,74 contributions,Aug 2017,"Ocean allows to bathe there, waves are not so cruel like on other beaches of Bali. Sometimes water brings too much of garbage but local people are very fast to clean up the mess"
Mandm715,"Teignmouth, UK",Mar 2017,"This beach is pretty narrow and the sea is too rough to swim.  However, it does have visiting turtles in the evening and there are lots of pretty shell."
kuns8530,"Vadodara, India",Feb 2017,good for a leisure and/or romantic stroll along the shore. calm sea good for swimming or just laying in the sun sand and water! best experience of beach side.
RydoBurr,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,Having tried a few different beaches in Bali Nusa Dua is the best I have come across so far. Its really clean and if you are willing to walk all the way past the St Regis then it is very quiet and makes for some excellent photos.
deejay90210,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2017,"A very beautiful and lively beach, with some good beach activities. We were lucky to see an ongoing festival, which made our visit even more special. Water was not very deep, so the kids had a lot of fun. Definitely, one of the best beaches Bali has to offer."
1952desiree,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2017,Its just superb the MELIA RESORT SPA  has its swimming pool virtually on its beach such a treat plus the Santeria restsurant borders on the beach as well was delightful for lunch and a great barbecue buffet in the evening with good band and after a disco if you like plus it offers happy hours at its bar 
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,"I went to this beach for a one day trip from Seminyak, I used Uber to reach the beach (paid around 150,000 IDR), and came back to seminyak again with a bike driver (+62 0 819-3305-1669 for 300,000 IDR). Compared to Seminyak beach it is much cleaner with a brown clear sand, area is calm and having different luxurious hotels). 2 coffee bars/restaurants are available of which Fleet Bar caff√®. Also you can enjoy massage in the beach for a very low price."
Carl-Thomo,"Aberdeen, UK",Jun 2017,"There are some stunning beaches in Nusa Dua, however many have a big issue with plastic waist being washed up. I thing the hotels should make more effort and so should all the local people, in terms of cleaning up and recycling. "
acsaroj,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2017,a very well maintained and neat and clean beach...was there with my 1 year old son and i could leave him comfortably on the sand..awesome place to take some great and memorable photos...

shreef n,3 contributions,Aug 2017,"In my opinion, the only merit of this beach is it's quietness. If you seek good view, relaxing and having a tan then this is the place to go. On the other hand, if you are a surfer or water sports lover then you will not find theses activities there. Personally, I liked it so so much specially when you compare it with beaches in Legian or Sanur. Legian beach is perfect for surfers while Sanur beach is good for water sports."
Saanchi A,11 contributions,Aug 2017,"This was probably one of the most beautiful beaches I have seen and experienced! And the best part is that it is not too crowded, feels like you have the beach to yourself!"
Pavel V,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"I love Nusa Dua. I visit Bali two times a year and Nusa Dua is our favorite destination. We have here our favorite hotels. Beach is perfect for family trip with small kids. This isnt place for surfing. Small waves, so its friendly to you baby. A lot of watter sports with pleasent staff. "
DaghanS,79 contributions,Aug 2017,The Nusa Dua beach is so beautiful. The water is clear and the whitish sand is really soft on your feet. The resorts surrounding this area have lovely bars and restaurants next to it also. But there is one thing you should really consider before going: the high and low tides! During our stay at the Westin we could not enjoy swimming every day because of the low tide. During this low tide it's fun to walk and talk to the local fisherman. I don't know if there is an app for it but please make sure before heading to it if there isn't a low tide. Otherwise you can't use your snorkel. 
ErmaMalekkidou,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Aug 2017,"Have been staying at a resort in Nusa Fua area and we have been swimming every day.Water was good, not very salty, cold at the beginning but then you get used to it.At the shore the beach had many algae.In the afternoon the water goes in and you can walk where the water was."
Tijana P,34 contributions,Aug 2017,A local told us Nusa Dua is the most beautiful beach in Bali. It is definitely better than most beaches we have seen here but it is not a WOW one. All the resorts all located at Nusa Dua beach so it is quite crowded. The water is full of sea grass and other stuff... All in all it is a lovely long beach.
John S,24 contributions,Aug 2017,"This beach serves several upscale resorts including Regis, Adoydya and under construction Hilton. The beach is very walkable with light colored sand and a fell shells here and there. The surf varies according to tides but is naturally regulated by reef shelf 1/4 mile off shore. Most beach activity occurs close to the resort property lines. A large variety of beach equipment rentals are available along with potpourri of kites, toys and beachside foods. Remember bring your own bottled water and strong sunscreen. The beach is roomy and safe."
Dini A,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Always visit the beach once a month only for relax, having lunch by the seq while watching children enjoy the beach and play sands. No to busy beach very warm and elegant"
RaKs24,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,There is one section of the Nusa Dua Beach where all top hotels are located and this section is like their private beaches . There is another section of Nusa Dua where all the adventure sports take place . All in all a very clean and safe beach . 
EllenOnVacation,California,Aug 2017,"This beach by far is much better than Seminyak beach.The area is surrounded by luxury hotels.  The sand is not as white as Cancun but somewhere between. The water is clear but during high tide, there is debris and some trash washing up.The hotel staff are diligent at cleaning but there is only so much they can do."
Secret_Moments,23 contributions,Aug 2017,"After hearing how wonderful Nusa Dua beach is, we decided to go and check it out for ourselves. We were disappointed. The sand is dirty with tiny pieces of glass and debris. The water is knee high and the beach has no personality. What a bore! Go to Echo Beach, Batu Bolong Beach (both in Canggu) or Padang Padang Beach (in Uluwatu) instead! :D "
fotochap,"London, United Kingdom",Aug 2017,"A great beach for some R&R. The grains of sand are weirdly somewhat spherical, which means you can sink in a fair bit. There's lots of tiny crabs that flit about as you walk along. When the tide is out, there's a huge expanse of shallows to explore. Just don't get caught out when it comes back in!"
Dr Lois F,"Los Angeles, CA",Aug 2017,This is a pristine beach far from the crowds.  Have stayed at the Westin here several times and never disappointed. Highly recommend.  
Therese  T,12 contributions,Aug 2017,"Not much more to say. Many private beaches, which is nice if you belong to one of them which we did, but if we hadn't it might have not have been so nice.Very clean and nice for someone like me who get jittery every time something unknown touches me in the sea."
Shadiahalsolami,"Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2017,"One of the best beaches.It has a white sands ,good to walk barefoot and good for kids to play.Nice view at sunrise and sunset.In some parts there is allots of water sports "
Maksat A,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,"Nusa dua beach is very clean and no strong waves at the coast compare to other areas in Bali, but please bare in mind that generally all the things are more expensive in Nusa Dua area."
andyros2014,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Nov 2016,"The beach is really nice indeed although there were lots of dead weeds in the water during our stay. apart from that the water is crystal clear, the sand is clean and the hotels around offer enough to eat and drink in order to stay happy while relaxing and sunbathing."
Moving Butler,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Just as you would expect from a post card, these beaches are golden and heavily maintained. Be sure to go to a space that you can be in as most places are reserved by the shore side hotels. There are places that allow you to use a sun bed and order off the menu for a fee.  "
roadtrippernineteen,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2017,Great little Lagoon bay. Calm waters with Rocky areas further out. Food available supported by the hotels and the beach is clean. 
CarelRed,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Great beach, heard that it is drily and not that flash but we experienced it as a well maintained beach with the resorts managing the tourist littering well and keeping it in great form.  Sunrise was particularly excellent."
Alicja R,106 contributions,Aug 2017,"Beautiful beach in Bali. Clean beach, well maintained waterline, warm water, lots of fish. I would recommend !!! :-)"
SheilaRed,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"A long, long beach, that changes character and cleanliness as you go. The beach in front of Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and its neighbours is maintained in pristine condition - early in the morning sweepers can be found at work, and throughout the day cleaners move through the area picking up rubbish. The sunrises are an ever-changing canvas, and when the heat sets in, the loungers are well-shaded under the trees.  At low tide, the sea grasses and sand pools are worth wading through, but tread carefully, as sea anemones lurk in the shadows!"
karl,"Seal, UK",Aug 2017,Great beach very clean and great to swim in. Can get anything in the beach to do such as jet sky etc.. you don't get bugged by the local sellers.
Moris,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,The beach is amazing unfortunately is not much clear in some zone. Beach is long and you can rent a latvian beach with few euros! Place to go if you want relax 
Mohamed I,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2017,The sport activities are nice but the beach is not clean and the sport equipments are old. To enjoy the activities you need to bring your own equipments 
Filip S,ghent,Oct 2016,"white sands, clear blue water, the side of Grand Hyatt hotel is more private, less crowded. The other side full of beach bars and a lot of people. The beach can use more maintenance, a lot of trash everywhere"
Taytaylam333,"London, UK",Aug 2017,Staying at the nusa dua beach and spa hotel the beach is beautiful can't fault it. Clean. Beautiful sand no rocks. Ocean is clear and warm. Just a perfect environment. Has plenty of trees if you get too hot and it really is hot on the beach even the wind is hot perfect for those wanting a deep tan! 
Emily G,"Essex, UK",Aug 2017,"This beach was just outside our hotel (Grand Hyatt) - it is beautiful, clean and there are always sun beds free (based on a holiday that took place at the end of July/beginning of August) - if you are looking to take part in water sports however, due to there being a strong wind there was more often than not a red flag to show that the water was not safe to be surfing/playing about in too much as it got quite choppy at times! "
Bergees I,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,Awesome holiday at nusa dua. Loved the entire stay at westin. Beautiful place with awesome people who welcome all with open arms. 
Eric E,66 contributions,Apr 2017,"What can one say about the beach here that hasn'tt already been said, the water here is pristine most of the time, extremely clean and just a great place to catch some sun or go for a dip, easy access and if your staying at one of the resort that border the water it's quiet and peaceful, sand is clean and the kids would love it."
ehughes48,12 contributions,Mar 2017,"Beautiful sand and trash filled water.  There is a serious trash problem in the water in Bali. Bali has every kind of beach. Some are great for surfing, some for watersports, etc. This area has lots of watersports but the water is full of trash."
TravelDiaries_Pulkit,"1,523 contributions",Aug 2017,"This beach is just amazing. White sand, clear water and beautiful landscape - what else do you expect?Located close to a lot of great hotels, the crowd and the facilities provided at this beach is great. Highly recommended!"
Ebony R,21 contributions,Aug 2017,Full of rubbish but still nicer than Kuta. Was fun playing among the rock pools looking at little sea creatures. The scenery is nice if you focus to the distance and not the floating nappy by the waters edge. Surf seemed good 
abhi2001_10,"Hyderabad, India",Jul 2017,Very clean beach in the secluded Nusa Dua area - the hotels here try and keep the beaches as clean as possible - also not as crowded as Kuta or Seminyak
slalexan,"Drummonds, TN",Jul 2017,Simply amazing with awesome scenery and restaurants with food selections that are scrumptious!! I enjoyed the beach with friends and solo!
Susan N,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Aug 2017,"If you like getting smacked around in the waves and letting the current carry you along, then this is the beach for you. We had a ball in the waves, we went in one part of the beach and let the current take us along and then jumped out and did it again."
BenTas36,"Launceston, Australia",Jul 2017,We were surprised at how clean the beach was and it was nice to go and sit on the beach and just relax. 
Anabela V,"Macau, China",Nov 2016,"We stay in a private beach  hotel,  so the beach was only for hotel guests! Clean and well treated:)They also offer yoga classes, cicling to their guests! I'm sure this is one of the best beach you find in Bali,  because in this beach stands the rich and famous hotels there! To visit Bali  beautiful beaches, you have to go book a boat and go an smaller island! There you with have better & cleaner beaches! "
Patrickc69,"Saas-Fee, Switzerland",Aug 2017,"Nice beach.  Sand is white and good. Not much space to swim, very shallow.  Waves look nice but far and no one go there (dangerous?).  Good beaches but far from Cara√Øbes beaches quality "
ANAND DESAI,"Ahmedabad, India",Jul 2017,Sofitel hotel has its own beach in NUSA DUA Very clean. Beaches and crystal clear water You can enjoy leisure walking during sunset and surise Enjoy relaxing body message in the cool air
Mariana R,2 contributions,Aug 2017,"Perfect for family with kids. The current is mild and water is pleasant so kids happily go into the ocean. Sunrise is gorgeous. And the beach is lit up for the evening. Spectacular. Great for watersports for beginners: paddle board, windsurf, etc. Close to great snorkling and diving sites. Love it! "
bergy2017,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,"White sand, green and blue ocean with a great break. Plenty to see from the hotel frontages to the water sports and temples. "
JBGourmet,"Masai, Malaysia",Jul 2017,"Nice sandy stretch of  beach that was very pleasant to be at. Less crowded and no one trying to see you stuff. We took a long walk from the Novotel private beach to lunch at Nusa Dua Beach Grill,  had a wonderful lunch experience. "
Leah A,64 contributions,Jul 2017,This is one of the nice beaches of Bali. It is very clean and well maintained but expect the flock of tourists. This is within the area of  the huge hotels so many people come and enjoy the view as well as take a dip.
AussieMike,"Acton Park, Australia",Jul 2017,"Lovely beach but as with almost all tropical beaches we have visited, there is loads of plastic in the sand... its the sad state of the world we live in now üò¢"
Gzd5,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2017,"Nice beach for sunbathing or walking. Not good for swimming comparing to Mediterranean Sea. But still better than Kuta. On high tide, you may swim with seaweeds."
Corryn60FR,39 contributions,Jul 2017,"Nice beach, clearwater.Nusa Dua is a safe area, with shopping area, restaurants, lots Of activities."
Janine636,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"The Nusa Dua Beach resort area is well maintained with loads of top resorts to choose from.  The beach itself is nice enough, clean and looked after by the various resorts along its shore...the tides are extreme so you have to pick your beach times carefully.  There aren't too many locals harrassing you to buy their products which is good."
Mouhannad_ElMidani,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Dec 2016,This is a clean sandy beach with calm waves. We had direct access by staying at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. Locals sell handmade stuff. Can spend a relaxing time under the palms. 
carole h,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2017,Great for watching sunrise (Seminyak for sunsets!)Particularly good for water sports enthusiasts - plenty of choice for all ages.My preference is floating around in the warm shallow water in the secure areas away from the jetskis etc.Lovely area for parents with little kids!And no hassles from vendors on this beach.
saurabh2591,"Noida, India",Jul 2017,beautiful.. serene.. amazing place for a long romantic walks.. take a dip in sea.. sit on the side with your favorite beer.. just awesome
sanjeevcc,Kolkata,Jun 2017,Nice beach with clear sand. No activities at the beach however the beach is very good and clean. Can enjoy
Ahmed_abdoul-al,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"Good place for spend time with friends or family. Beautiful sea, very clean beach...  Right place to relax and enjoy . Good service as well. "
Dkkeeling,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2017,I think a good second to Jimbaran beach on Bali islandPleasant and nice and they say good for Surfers
SylviaHill,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,"Beautiful beaches, can walk along the whole length of beach. All the five star hotels are along here and all of them have beautiful beach bars also on the beach. We've been visiting a different one each day. All good. "
Sharonandrea,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,Spectacular beach and I am not a beach person usually. The water was warm and the beach constantly cleaned. Vendors are limited by the resorts so you are not constantly hassed
j0hanna76,"Tranemo, Sweden",Feb 2017,once you enter the water it is full of plastic and there are no life guards for the children. very unfriendly staff on the ground
Amul M,"Uppermill, UK",May 2017,"Stayed in The Laguna Beach Luxury Collection a stunning beach front hotel, the beach is maintained daily with tranquil waters, the tide does come in and out and a marked difference between high tide and low tide, lovely beach."
Abby,"Cologne, Germany",Jul 2017,"This beach is your typical paradise when you think of Bali. Miles of pristine white sands and clear blue water with few rocks. The only thing that really bothered us were the sheer volume of chinese tourists taking photos on the beach. Not just a few nice photos but literally spending hours posing on the beach with sarongs blowing in the wind, etc. It got annoying because they told us to move several times so we weren't in the background. Best not to make eye contact either or you'll be stuck taking all the photos for them - this happened to us twice. "
aston ashley W,97 contributions,Jul 2017,"Really clear water, much cleaner than Kuta but kind of boring if you're not doing water sports. Also most of the beach is reserved for hotel guests and a small section is public, where vendors start charging Rp. 250,000.00 for a deck chair and you can maybe bargain down to 100,000.00 so felt abit alienated. Better in the morning, low tide in July so the water started moving back slowly as the afternoon went on, pretty cool to see though! There were some food stalls there with seating space, nothing impressive, a 500ml water cost Rp.10,000.00 hotel prices so pack a nice picnic basket."
Marilyn,23 contributions,Jul 2017,A beautiful beach with beautiful views. Good pavement to walk on. Many places along the way for coffee or drinks 
Joseph C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2017,The stretch of beach is wonderful windy clear beach and water. Just nice for couple family. Best if stay in resort. They have people clean the beach all the time.
happytrailsnoco,"Wellington, CO",Mar 2017,Many of the beaches in the Kuta area are less then pristine in paticularly in off season are not well maintained with litter on the beaches and debris such as plastic waste washed ashore Also uncommon in much of this area are green open spaces. Nusa Dua offers a large green park area adjoining the beach. The beach is well maintained and clean.It costs nothing to get in even though it is part of a larger resort.The landscape around the beach is striking-check out the cactus. The tidepools at sunset/low tide are worth exploring.
Domdanny,Sydney,Jul 2017,Nusa Dua beach is beautiful especially near St Regis hotel and Mulia resort . You can enter in between the hotels there is a road that leads you directly to the beach  . You must visit 
Patty W,"Ogden, UT",Jul 2017,The beach is very clean.  The sand is quite coarse and can get quite hot.  Plenty of shade.  There are lots of vendors walking around which gets a little annoying.  Waiters are walking around for drink service.
Monami_Bangalore,"Bengaluru, India",Jun 2017,Very quiet and beautiful. Most beaches in bali are crowded but this beach was not so. Not recommended for swimming.
christiano_10,"Tczew, Poland",Jul 2017,"blue water, beautiful views, not many people - this place is much better compared with the busy, crowded and noisy Kuta beach."
Annie G,"Chatswood, Australia",Jul 2017,"We spent some of our time at the beach adjacent to our resort, and it was very nice. There were some plants floating in the water sometimes, and the jetskis and windsurfers were often very close to swimmers, which can be dangerous.The sand was clean. The massages on the beach are terrible - unprofessional and expensive. You're better off walking into town and having one at the spas there..."
s0nty,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Surprisingly the beach now is more crowded with tourist wearing full cloth :/ And unfortunately all the beach spot there already owned by the hotels around :( Although its not as quiet as couple year before, but the beach still a nice spot and kids friendly. "
Stephanie S,10 contributions,Jul 2017,"It was nice to walk around there and to get  traditional light meal, very cheap. The beach was clean and the water very calm  but not good for swimming because the water was a little bit muddy. Not much we can do here."
Kyriakos_Hasapis,"Nicosia, Cyprus",Jul 2017,"The view of the ocean is breathtaking!! I could lay on the beach and see the ocean for hours, ordering a fruit punch and enjoy the view.. Swimming into the ocean is not recommended if you are not a experienced swimmer. The sea is not the cleanest I have ever seen, but the sand without rocks is nice to walk on. Overall this is not the best sea for swimming, but the view is exceptional."
Joao B,"Lisbon, Portugal",Jul 2017,"This beach is sunny and quiet, very pleasant to walk or stay in the sun. It is not excellent to swim because there are rocks in the bottom of the sea, visible at low tide. However, there are some areas where we can bathe without any problem"
waterstarz,3 contributions,Jul 2017,Nice sandy beach but small. Low tide at times so not possible to go into the sea. Not suitable for very young children as the water isnt very calm
Kate R,29 contributions,Jul 2017,Beautiful and clean full of resorts. We weren't allowed to be under the trees. Bring your own shade or spend time in the public part and hire a beach chair.  Take a trip down to waterblow
tim r,"Chester, UK",Jul 2017,We stayed at Nusa Due Resort and this area is very nice and relaxed. As you move north the beach becomes very busy with motorised water sports (a bit like a motorway). Beach itself is good though. Sea is tidal so you need to plan your day to swim inside the nominated area.
Kim W,9 contributions,Jul 2017,We spent the afternoon here and thought it was stunning. The beach was far more picturesque than that of Kuta/Seminyak/Jimbaran. We walked out to the blow hole and then sunbathed on the stretch of beach between the two peninsulas. Definitely worth a visit! 
Bratcatcher,"Portsmouth, UK",Jul 2017,"Wouldn't spend much time on this beach, lots of litter and coastal erosion has taken away the pathway. Very run down and not pretty at all. "
Bernadette C,24 contributions,Apr 2017,A must see and enjoyed many lovely walks here but was expecting the waters to look like pics.Water for swimming can be quite rough in some spots.Lovely to lay on lounge in sun and enjoy a quite setting in bali for a week prior going home.
SonS1975,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,One of the cleaner beaches in the tourist areas and close to the blow hole. Protected beach by reef/ rocks. Kids loved it
Kerry M,"Minchinhampton, UK",Jul 2017,"Lovely white sandy beech but watch the waves and currents, they can take you unawares. One minute my husband paddling ankle deep in water the next he was in the water minus his sunglasses!There is a lifeguard but take care, particularly if you have children or you're not a strong swimmer."
Alekchansuang,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2017,"The best beach from Bali. Top location, the sea is quiet on that side and you choose between water sport or relaxing on sunbeds. We recommend this part of Bali if you are looking tranquility and serenity."
archibalda,"Acapulco, Mexico",May 2017,"You should never ask Mexicans or Australians about beaches as they get an unpleasant sneer and say ""we have better at home"" and I'm sorry to say this was what happened with our predominantly Mexican/Australian group. Having said that, the water was warm and we had fun with paddleboards. "
Neville2907,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Had a great holiday in Bali, living or based in Nusa Dua and then exploring Bali from there. This area is quitter than the Kuta area. The hotel was 5 minutes from the beach."
ShellyGott,"Salt Lake City, UT",Jul 2017,"The beaches on Nusa Dua were what you dreamed beaches would be in Bali Beautiful sand, clean, and you could walk pretty far into the ocean. We snorkeled and had a great time.  They offer parasailing, paddle boarding, etc. or it was calm and beautiful to just lay on the beach with a good drink and a great  bookI would highly recommend a resort on Nusa Dua BeachWe stayed at the Westin Hotel Perfect location to enjoy the beach."
Jeanie J,27 contributions,Jul 2017,"Clean; great staff, drinks and food! Just perfect! I would return at any opportunity! There was great entertainment for couples, families, any one looking for a fabulous vacation location. "
dibanov,Indonesia,Jul 2017,nice mixed experience of green gardens and beach... and this beach is peaceful although many tourists there ( we went on high season in July 2017)... 
LovingLife2013_13,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,Nice clean beach close to Nusa Dua resorts. There can be a small wave but generally it is pretty flat close to shore.
James N,6 contributions,Jul 2017,"Water was very far out due to the low tide for most of the day which was frustrating, because the beach is beautiful when there's enough water to swim. Water sports offered along the beach are quite pricy and can be quite annoying. The beach itself has potential, but the low tide during the day took away the option of a nice swim in the sun which was disappointing."
Psalm2,India,May 2017,A white sand beach. Water sports available too. Bali Collection with numerous eating places is just a walking distance away.
Advourner,"New York City, NY",Aug 2016,"This is a great beach, but should be cleaned more regularly.  I loved lounging on it at the SR Hotel."
Lyn C,7 contributions,Jun 2017,Stayed in Nusa dua for a week and we loved it. We stayed at nusa dua beach hotel and resort and we had our own private beach. It clean and the water was clear. Not as busy as kuta or seminyak but we were there the first week of June so not yet peak season. I highly recommend this beach if you're looking for more clean & relaxing beach
Heath E,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"beach is groomed daily, first time I have seen sea snake babies on sand heading to the water (before sunrise very rare) , very safe beach swam with children in the water minimal risk of stingers / or sharks although a strong current and undertow, very safe and very interesting, ."
Maximilian K,61 contributions,Jul 2017,"As travellers that have been to Seminyak, Canggu, Ubug, Gili's and Lombok before we were really disappointed by Nusa Dua (very artificial, overpriced, not authentic, no good restaurants!). We felt like we ended up in Disney Land. Everything is full of Chinese tourists, we even got asked by them if they can take pictures of us (we are Europeans). Place of mass tourism, crowded beaches, you'll get the Nusa Dua bonus on everything you buy (scooters, petrol, hotels, food). If all this doesn't matter to you and you want to ride a jetski, go parasailing or whatever do watersport in a place which does not represent Bali at all, then spend 100$ more and go to a hotel in the gated area!"
Dav Anmed,"Ciudad Juarez, Mexico",Jul 2017,Yes ppl dont freak out! Gili & lombok are amazing but are far from denpasar.Clean miles of sand! A lot of resorts to rent an umbrella if you consume a meal or drinks (300k on july2017)...To me the best beach! No trash and less crowded than kuta and seminyak.
Bolynn B,Gold Coast,Jul 2017,"Nusa Dua is very upmarket boasting some amazing hotel/resorts, however, you could be anywhere in the world as it is quite clinical compared to the rest of Bali. Accomodation is pricey but still more affordable than the same sort of hotels would be in Australia. Food, beverages and entertainment are pretty much Aussie prices. I paid $15 AUD for an entree size plate of tomatoes, basil and mozzarella cheese in our hotel, which was expensive even by Aussie standards. A SUP will cost you $15 per hour, a bicycle $5 per hour. In Sanur, we paid $3 per day for a bicycle at The Puri Santrian which is also a 5 star hotel. I have to say I far prefer Sanur in terms of value for money and the beaches are just as nice. "
Nathan L,3 contributions,Aug 2016,"Stayed here around 2015 and thought it was really good. The facilities are good but not as good as the grand Hyatt. The fitness centre was really good, the pool was nice and all the resturants were really good. The breakfast was amazing and was much better than the grand Hyatt. The lobby was incredible and is one of the best I have seen. However when I stayed there wifi wasn't free in the rooms so I had to go to the pool or lobby to get internet access. I'm not sure if this has changed or not. The rooms were very nice and they weren't noisy at all compared to the grand Hyatt which is much older. Overall I think it's a nice place to stay, it's not as close to the connection centre compared to the grand Hyatt but it is a great hotel and I will possibly go back again."
Mandy673,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2017,"Great place to visit, would definitely recommend, however living on the Sunshine Coast our beaches are by far better & CLEANER."
NancyTravels13,34 contributions,Aug 2016,"I'm glad to stay here after a very long and exhausting travel. Everything was quiet, peaceful and great to recover and lounge around the beautiful beaches "
gingerdip,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Sand not compact, many sharp stones, shells and rubbish washed ashore. Lots of seaweed, not recommended for children or anyone to swim out. Waves r big. View was good because the beach is private. Many wedding photographers coming in to take pics and shushed away by security. Wedding photo groups can add up to 4 or 5 every day! They smoke, litter and spit on the private beach. Hope ayodya security can effective chase them away and employ staff to clean beaches. Ironically the staff pick fallen leaves but not rubbish."
Romario1257,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"This year we decided not to have daily trips to temples as already done this last times and just enjoy the beach.We choose Nusa Dua and was perfect choice for my taste and needs:- beach was clean- you can see morning sunrise - water not to deep- water sports available- a lot of beachfront 5 stars hotels- a running path just along the beach for few kilometers - a close area with restaurants with live music and shopping opportunities - beach bars at each hotel- well maintained beach by each hotel with sun beds and shadow opportunities as after 11 AM the sun can be strong- every day a cool breeze from ocean all day long made the weather just perfectDefinitely if you look for sun, beach, sea and less crowd this is the place.I will definitely be back.Enjoy!"
amrita_77,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",May 2017,"Beautiful white sand beach..most of the luxury resorts are near to this beach.Many restaurants,souvenir shops are nearby.Beach is ideal for surfing."
Clive M,"Lyndoch, Australia",Aug 2016,"Stayed at The Grand Aston Nusa Dua Great Resort, the beaches along that strip are amazing and the beach activities so many things to do . but I think my favorite part was as soon as you step back into the resort Serenity."
Feride I,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2017,"It's a nice beach, although you have to walk for about 5-10 mins to reach the nicer area of the beach (the sea is very shallow in one part, so you have to walk pass by it). After you pass the grand Hyatt hotel area you arrive to that part. The sunbeds costs50k per 1, the beach is quite clean, not perfectly clean though. The water is clean, only some seaweed is on the seashore, but it's not bothering you. The beach is quite without any sellers. The sea is sandy with no stones, which is also nice, coz you can play and walk safely. "
BOBBOTOFFO15,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2017,We loved relaxing on the loungers at the beach. The calming noise of the sea and the clear water with nice sand. The beach is surrounded by some of the best hotels in Nusa Dua. The sellers don't really hassle you much and are friendly. The tide has an impact late afternoon which impacts the sea that is the only real disappointment. 
DavidDundonald,"Edinburgh, UK",Jun 2017,"Golden sands, shallow shelving and crystal clear water. This is a lovely beach. Delighted to have spent a week here. "

Victoria G,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2017,The beach at nusa dua is lovely but due to the peak season the water is filled with trash everywhere.Found loads of plastic wrappers and tissues and wasnt pleased about the cleaniness. 
Paulus C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Beach nusa dua is beautiful and clean. Safe for families with small children. Hardly any garbage, the sea water is blue clean and the waves are not too big."
Lesley M,"Aldershot, UK",Jun 2017,"Not to many hassles from people selling stuff, great place to relax good food ü•ò around.Very clean."
juliekBucks,chesham,Jun 2017,"Beautiful beach, the best. So clean, white sand, like paradise. Have to go through security, bu we were lucky enough to by taxi, and they let us in. Not all the beach sellers to bother you either."
Sunil N,"Gurgaon, India",Apr 2017,Visited Nusa Dua for 3 nights... it was a great experience. If you are looking for a beach location in Bali.. this is a good option.Most good hotels have their private beach and resturants inside the property. You wouldn't feel the need to go out of your property.Ocean view rooms will be a good option. We chose grand mirage.. good option. There are other expensive options too.. depending on your pocket.Overall a good place with a good beach.
Sarah G,24 contributions,Dec 2016,From the hotel Nusa dua beach hotel it was 10 min walk and we walked through all the different resorts
Fiofaith,Jakarta,Jun 2017,One of the best beach in Bali and not consume to public so my family can play and relax around the beach.
Tjokrosaputro,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"If there is the ultimate getaway in Indonesia where we can escape from everything else with a 5 start treatment, not to worry about quality of life, Nusa Dua is the place. This is the place Indonesia can be proud of and the resort area other countries envy.Miles of white sand beach, gentle even for beginners and children, plenty of water activities and tens of 5 star hotel resorts from the best names in the hospitality industry.A very secured place for all, the resort offer areas for those who are active from the break of dawn till after midnight as well as those who needs place to relax. "
Mei Y,"Nullagine, Australia",Jun 2017,"Nusa Dua is dominated by 5 star resort with shady trees and beach chairs while the Jombaran Beach is reserved only for sunset seafood dining. Bali is so well endowed with kilometres and kilometres of sandy beaches that every part of the island can be carved out for different activities! With the hot sun during the day, hotels at Nusa Dua has done a great job in softening it up with investing in rows and rows of trees and shades, beach chairs, seaside activities... What a place to relax! There is a small portion open to the public. Beach chairs can be rented along the public section"
Voyage_De_Plaisir,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jun 2017,I think one of the best beaches of Bali . Water sports awesome .... very clean and silver sand . Just loved it . 
VINEET S,6 contributions,Jun 2017,"Hi I have just returned from BALI  and our experience was amazing , culture , beaches , people at Bali are very close to Indian hearts we stayed at KUTA , NUSA DUA , And GILI TRAWANGAN And enjoyed the lot unlike to india beached are very clean and have all amenities only minus point is Bali beaches are filled with much stones  and many visitors specially children find it difficult to stay in local authority must put some information regarding the caution it will help tourist to pre plan to take beach footwear with them"
vtipping,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,Depending where you are the sea is out a bit but clean beach. The stray dogs are friendly so we fed them they eat very slowly which I didn't expect. You don't get all the bothering there either but can get cheap massage 
Angela R,5 contributions,Jun 2017,I came to Nusa Dua and suddenly i saw a banner with words 'Nusa Dua Lights Festival'.  It was such an amazing experience. I really enjoy the fest. So many food stans and others. Its really fun! 
Bill B,"Santa Monica, CA",Jun 2017,Great beach. Not too crowded .  A lot of good choices to eat and drink. Light show is not great but everyone goes to see it .  Best bike path in the island 
Rajesh K,"Pune, India",Jun 2017,"We visited Bali, Indinesia. We were staying at Mercure Nusa Dua hotel. The beach is very close and hotel arranges transport. We visited the evening and it was very pleasant. We spent more time to observe Indonesian marriage there.It was about to sunset, enjoyed a lot!  "
Traveldreams365,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,"Nusa Dua beaches are lined with beautiful 5 * Hotels, lovely gardens and restaurants. One can walk along the beachfront for kilometres enjoying the scenery and hotel facilities along the way.There are also little Balanize beach stalls along the way where one can purchase beachwear, sunglasses, hats and more.Plenty of water sports centres too, which is great entertainment if one sits observing all the activities.If you are lucky to be out first thing in the morning you may be lucky to view the magestic volcanic mountains before the clouds veil them for the day.A lovely part of BALI, with not too many people like the beaches in Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. Well worth a visit."
redd7734,"Irving, TX",Jun 2017,"We came out on a hot day. Our hotel had chairs and towels. The sand gave us a workout walking up and down, back and forth. The water felt nice, wasnt too windy outside. Seemed like alot of trash was left behind on the beach and in the water. Not to mention alot of rocks. We took nice pictures though..."
Sam M,"Antrim, UK",May 2017, Every day without fail my wife and I had a swim or a dip in the sea ( depending on the tide ) and afterwards a walk along the beach to dry off. It is cleared every day by the different hotels beach cleaners who keep it in tip top order. The only problem with this is that they also rake up the sea shells which we quite enjoy collecting. It is also a very interesting walk when the tide is out as you cane see lots of small fish in the shallows and if you are lucky a lot of starfish. Well worth the walk.
Pauly_Posh,"London, UK",Jun 2017,Lovely soft sand and clear waters great for everyone to enjoy. There are several people walking along the beach selling things which can be annoying as the beach is public and not hotel owned
Beverley65,"London, UK",May 2017,One of the nicest beaches in Bali. All the hotels have staff cleaning the beach daily. You can watch many weddings taking place.
Jasmine H,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"We just relaxed in the sea water and chatted as wave after wave just moved us in the water and when we were tired, we would just simply walk up to the deck chairs and order a bite to eat"
Bhoomika P,4 contributions,Jun 2017,Its one of the cleanest and quietest beach on the strip. has a nice photo and dinner point that you can pre book
Tim C,"London, UK",Jun 2017,Great sand beautiful warm water..Will be back. The reef 150 mtrs out means that the water is calm no matter how windy
JoelDSouza,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2017,This is one of the best beach in Bali. The water is clear Blue. I visited early morning during sunrise. The beach is very clean and calm. I also saw few people enjoying surfing at this beach.
ndmadan,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,We were overjoyed when we visited the Nusa Dua Beach specifically looked after by our Resort- Grand Bali. It was a lovely place to enjoy the calm waves & lush green water of the sea with plenty of Palm trees & a lovely snack point at the the place which was very refreshing 
rebelo1981,"Algarve, Portugal",May 2017,"If you walk north, you will find a peninsula, which has a massive statue in the middle and has some grass fields. Very nice area."
Joe S,39 contributions,Jun 2017,Nusa Dua as a beach is clean and some hotels even have staff clearing the seaweed. Relaxing walk for several kilometres stroll. Nice way to relax if you don't like cooking yourself sunbaking.
DCumberlidge,"Manchester, UK",Jun 2017,Definitely the best and cleanest beach we saw on the island. More peaceful than the Kuta side so perfect for relaxing 
Eric_Bachtiar,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"Fantastic beach, clean water, and hot weather if you like tanning. We were at the Novotel side of the beach. They provide some water sport activities too. Lots of tourist taning their skin there."
justine555,"Palmerston North, New Zealand",Jun 2017,"It's a nice beach. We walked along the length of it but spent most time down the southern end (near the Mulia hotel) where our hotel had a small deck chair area to relax. This location was not overly manicured like up the other end with the huge resorts. I really liked that it had more of a local feel. A couple of dogs lying on the sand (but no problem - in fact added nicely to the local ambience), sunbathers, boat renters, local bar and cafe (rougher style). You can also walk further south along the path in front of the Mulia hotel to a restaurant.  Lovely gold sand, which is coarse but still nice. The beach does go down quite rapidly into the water (southern end) so just take care to watch your kids when they go paddling/swimming. Also the sand in the water is very loose so your feet go down into it quite a lot! Makes it harder to walk but also weirdly fun!"
Varnika B,"Noida, India",Jul 2016,If you are looking for a pristine sandy blue crytal clear water beaches this is a place you should visit they have #luxury resorts and most of them are good and place to visit.
Kelli M,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"Most of the large hotel chains are situated on Nusa Dua beach. Because of this it means majority of the sand area is filled with hotel reserved lounge chairs. If you are not staying at that hotel you may have to pay a price to use a beach chair. This also makes it difficult to exercise around (running etc).Very clean water and the best area to do water sports in all of Bali. Prices vary depending on day, time and your success with bartering."
Luke H,9 contributions,Jun 2017,"Nice beach for relaxing and the Nusa Dua area is great to take it easy, totally contrasted with the business to the north in Kuta and Ubud. However, the beach isn't anything spectacular: unfortunately there's often rubbish such as plastic in the water, not to a huge degree but enough. Pretty good waves and very safe for swimming as the breakers are far out. It's very shallow for a long distance. For the best beaches nearby you need to take the boat out to Lembongan, there the coral is alive and thriving and the water is perfect."
Kenny C,4 contributions,Jun 2017,"Very nice beach, beautiful sand and clear water. Not at all crowded just before the busy season. We went in early June"
Nandini G,India,Dec 2016,Dnt miss if you love any form of water sports its simply great. there are various operators which offer different options. Drinking water and toilets are available near the beach. Beach is clean and great for hanging out.
Sue519,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"A nice strip of beach that runs along from the Ayodya past the Grand Hyatt Bali.Generally very clean compared to Tanjong Benoa etc.Many activities but do not go if you are looking for water sports.That,s what makes this area more relaxing and there are many hotel bars and food places along this strip.Try the Ayodya beach area for the lowest price beers and cocktails plus tasty food.You can even lounge there in the bean bags if you want to."
SteveJacksonnufc,"Gateshead, UK",May 2017,"The beach is some size and we were on differing portions of it at different times and on some occasions didn't time it right, so it gets a little getting used to. Too late in the afternoon then the tide was out and it really was no good. But when it was in the sand was beautiful ( a little too much rubbish and seaweed to be excellent ) and the waters soothing and warm. We spend a lot of time at the beach as opposed to the pool when away and Nusa Dua beach was good but not spectacular. I had expected better from Bali."
Bob K,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,"Relatively clean and not to choppy, said to be the best in the area. Used  it nearly every day, very nice and just outside our resort the inaya putri."
William Khoo,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"We walked around the beach and the shopping area. Just be careful that when you take a taxi back, the price is fixed and can be pricey. Hence you may want to get your pickup from wherever you come from.  "
GrahamAgnew,"Magheralin, UK",Jun 2017,"Beach is ok, the sand is coarse and the area advised to stay within is very shallow, there is a lot of weeds and chorale at 4 feet depth and I would not venture into this area having seen the sea life in the rock pools when the tide was out.Was ok but not what we expected "
rvpmumbai,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,Most of the beach is accessible through the 5 Star hotels that line it. There is public access though at one end. the waters are shallow till very far out into the sea. Water is clean and clear. Not much crowd as compared to the other Bali Beaches. Nice for a quiet time. Not much activity at this beach - we loved the place generally.
Jooellee,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,Well guarded area with securities everywhere. Perfect spot for picnics. There's bike rental if you wish to cycle around the area. There's also beach chairs along the beach for you to relax and graciously enjoy your coconut drinks (but it cost way way expensive compared to else where. 40 000RP for a coconut.)
dalilali,"London, UK",Jun 2017,"We spent 10 days in Nusa Dua. The beach is clean, clear blue water, waves calm enough for my 8 and 11 year old to swim and play around. The water is nice and warm and we often saw little fishes swimming nearby. We felt very safe any time of day or night. Another benefit is that you are able to watch Waterblow from here. Wouldn't stay in any other beach in Bali."
emmarmbrown,"Essex, UK",Jun 2017,"A simply breathtaking view, a tranquil paradise perfect for relaxing all day by the ocean or mooching along in the moonlight. "
Tien C,3 contributions,Jun 2017,We had spent 1 week at Nusa Dua beach and we really enjoyed that. Very wonderful beach. Good for honeymoon 
Godsgloriousworld,"London, UK",Jun 2017,Stayed at one of the Nusa Dua hotels which line the beach. Beach was clean and best of all for me I didn't see a single dog during any of the time I spent at the beach. Mostly tourists and towards one end of the beach was an area where a lot of locals bathed. There were a couple of vendors who approached but weren't at all insistent. Not the clearest water I've ever seen and some small stones etc. in parts but I was just grateful for a beach in Asia where I could totally relax and not worry about dogs.
onmove2013,"Caloundra, Australia",May 2017,We found Nusa Dua much better than Legian or Seminyak beach. By my 7.30 walk the beach had been cleaned. Even the leaves had been swept up around the beach entrance. 
Wim0705,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Since I was staying in seminyak and spent time in kuta I was looking for a bit nicer beach. Ended up in Nusa Dua, was not disappointed at all. Quiet, clean, relax. Great experience. Easy and cheap to get there using GrabCar. "
Tarmo M,1 contribution,Mar 2017,"Had a nice holiday in Nusa dua.Good place.The beach is wonderful,but the food and drinks is very expensive inside the hotels area.Had the good and cheapTaxi driver.If someone wants to drive with his taxi.Name is Putu Santika phone number +6281236906663"

Manjari G,"Watford, England, United Kingdom",May 2017,The waterblow in nusa dua beach was just awasome. Lovely place with natures beauty. Nusa dua beach is also beautiful and clean beach and much better than Kuta.
roglek,3 contributions,Jun 2017,"Very beautiful beach in south of bali, we spent all day to enjoy this beach. Sand is white and very clean beach."
gbmoneymatters,"Delta, Canada",Feb 2017,Very nice and clean.  Big difference from Kuta Beach.   Well maintained and secure.   Worth the drive if you're looking to spend  day on the beach.   
motyer,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2017,"It was very shallow so we could walk a bit, swim a bit and spend time relaxing.  be careful about the coral rocks though, some parts of the beach are filled with them and they can hurt to walk on."
PanamanianWanderlust,"Panama City, Panama",Jun 2017,"Nusa Dua is a great choice if you don't want the hussle of a noisy beach where everyone is partying, instead you want classy restaurants, good bars, walk and chill near the beach, beautiful balinese settings by the beach (gazebo bale bengong), peaceful bike rides, nice views... "
Mel L,31 contributions,Jun 2017,"Lots of water sports available, the water is a very pretty color but there is no surf close to sure. There are waves out the back though. At night it is deserted. "
Sajam13,Austrlua,May 2017,The path has washed away and not been repaired along 'The Bay' so to walk along the beach for Bebek Bengal to Pirates Bay you are negotiating broken concrete path & rubble. The area is not clean or looked after. From Melia onwards there is path and the beach is lovely. The hotels & beach cleaners make every effort to keep it clean. 
backpacks_kokil,"Guwahati, India",May 2017,"Simply put, there are lots of beaches in Bali. Nusa Dua is a little busy if one is looking for a getaway. But clean. Lots of water sport activities, grand beach resorts and spas. I would put this above Kuta which is overcrowded."
Alexey S,15 contributions,May 2017,"The beach looks like a dump area each morning, full of plastic crap and water weeds. The hotel staff keeps working through out the whole day to clean the beach. They do their job on sand but are not able to clean water that remains full of plastic crap and other stuff like women's pads and so on. It is not pleasant to swim in such water at all. The local authorities need to do something with it. The most part of people who come to spend their vacations on sea side have to stay in the pool area instead."
Mona C,240 contributions,Jun 2016,"We stayed at the hotel around Nusa Dua beach which is has the most of amenities that you'd expect from Java distric hotel.If you can stay in here based on promotional cost rate it would be good. As we know that Nusa Dua is prestigious location for upscale hotels.The beach are better than Kuta because almost everyday I saw many staff working very well to clean up the trash.But anyway, we had a romantic dinner at the beach and its so lovely!!"
lesley s,"Sturry, UK",May 2017,Can't fault it! Clean and plenty of comfortable sun beds - security excellent and staff so helpful and friendly I would recommend this 100%
Hasan S,3 contributions,May 2017,"Beach is very good and beautiful but tide is dangerous. Before 3 pm you may have a beatiful view, you can enjoy the sun and the ocean. "
Ginnie T,"Chandigarh, India",Jun 2016,Quite clear waters . The sand is powdery and light brown . Nusa dua beach is not very very crowded but has visitors from 5 star beach resorts engaging in water activities mainly . 
Climb14ers,"Colorado Springs, CO",May 2017,Nusa Due Beach is lined with resorts.  Most of them allow public access to the beach.  The beach has nice fine sand.  There are some pretty large tides so swimming is limited.  When the tides are low there is not enough water to swim and when the tide is in there is considerable surf and current.  There are plenty of places to eat along the beach.
JJMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2017,It is one of the cleanest public beaches in Bali. There are some hotels also in Nusa Dua with private beaches. 
Nigel S,"Canterbury, UK",May 2017,"Beach is lovely, however spoilt by us humans with the usual plastic bottles and crap washed up, can never understand why people leave their crap on the beach, just shows their class I suppose, the guys clean the beach daily and is really nice."
969ivorm,"Belgium, WI",May 2017,"This beach used to be a gem, loved the water here. Great food Great Place. becomes very hot in the afternoon"
MonikaModakDass,"Aurangabad, India",Oct 2016,"Clean, unspoilt..one could have a candlelit dinner organised there! The beach itself is not large. It would be better to go in the evenings and enjoy a beautiful sunset."
larrif,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2017,"beach was  very pleasant and if yu r fan of water sports, then this is the place for all the water sport activity."
Jean-Pierre M,"Montreal, Canada",May 2017,"WATER BLOW: nice but, depending on weather conditions, you might have to be patient if you want to get ""the"" shot so plan to stay there a little while if pictures/video is important to you.PRIVATE BEACH (FREE!): my wife and I stumbled upon a nice, deserted and almost virgin beach there. On the way to the Water Blow, get off the path a little before the Water Blow when you see a little temple between the trees to your right. There you will find a little private beach. We stayed there 2 hours and had the whole place to ourselves."
Ujwala S,1 contribution,May 2017,"It was a superb experience with Mr.Gel gel. He took all the efforts from pick up , all the sports and dropping. What ever he advises is apt. He told us to pay for only 4 sports and if we have still energy left then we can plan as he advised we were completely drained after 4 sports. My 4 year son had a great time and it is Very safe. He takes all precautions to ensure everything is alright. Jet water pack is the best it is not so easy his instructors were very good. Very patient they were and they were very happy when I finally succeeded...perfect teachers"
Hasheena,1 contribution,May 2017,Awesome white Sands beach and pvt villas around. You can chill at a resort beach bar with long chairs and umbrellas...happy hour available most of the day
Adam T,"Petersham, Australia",May 2017,"Large tides can play havoc with swimming plans. I would say don't rely on great beach swimming, get it when you can but have a great pool as plan B. "
Mohammad S,29 contributions,Oct 2016,"During our visit to Bali Indonesia to attend our Global event we stayed in Westin Resort hotel near Nusa Dua Beach. By far this was my best experience  of staying in great and luxurious hotel and also enjoying the real life of Nusa Dua Beach. It was very attractive, sunny, golden sand based beach with tropical Trees all round the place. It was just a marvelous place to be there. I strongly recommend it to all peoples visiting Bali."
Emma N,13 contributions,May 2017,Easy to relax in the sun and sand. Low stress and plenty of options for things to do for the whole family. Love the small stalls every now and then on the beach walk. Great for everyone. 
Yang C,320 contributions,May 2017,"Nice beach, the sand very soft and niceGreat scenery but the sad we can not sit on there, some place are restricted for public the public only cAn goes through in without place to rest on"
Jillian W,29 contributions,Apr 2017,"We liked the beach in Nusa Dua because it was quiet and you weren't constantly bombarded with folks trying to sell you something. The surf can be a bit rough at times, but it's a great beach for surfing and hoodie boarding. "
Meagan C,"Greenvale, Australia",Apr 2017,The beach is connected to the hotel and was great  - had a wonderful massage on the beach  - and drinks from the on beach bar
HoneyandPaul,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2017,"Great beach, in fact pristine as a result of the individual efforts of the various Five Star Hotels on the beachfront. "
Sher Leen,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2017,"My husband and I been to a few beaches in Bali and we think Nusa Dua is the best beach among the others. The sand is white, soft and most importantly clean. The water is clean and clear and fishes can be seen swimming through the patches of seagrasses just slightly off the beach. Nusa Dua is a public beach but most part of the beach are already taken up by the hotels. You can still find a few spots with shades but make sure you bring your own mat or scarf to lay on the beach. The beach seatings owned by the hotels can be used as long as you order some drink or food from them. We ordered a drink for IDR105k, which is pretty expensive, and used their beach chairs for a few hours."
Phil W,"Bournemouth, UK",May 2017,"We stayed at the Grand Bali Hotel and this section of beach for the hotel was at the far end. The water was full of plastic, wood and other junk and made a dip in the sea unpleasant. There were workers raking the beach but then digging holes to bury the same rubbish! I personally wouldn't go back to Nusa Dua"
1LifeTravel,12 contributions,May 2017,"My fianc√© and I got here in the afternoon on May 23, 2017 from Ayana Resort on the Western side of Bali. The tide was low and the water was set back about 300 yards from the shore. To really enjoy the ocean at Nusa Dua you have to be at the beach in the morning until around 1-2pm before the ocean recedes. The Pics never show that. "
Asbestos3939,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",May 2017,"This beach is not what you think it is , it's just a place for locals to make money of the tourist 300% more than anywhere else in Bali and clear waters is not the really what you see well it was not in May when we went "
Nikita Gupta,"Chandigarh, India",May 2017,nusa dua beach is a very clean beach and offers spectacular views.It is a clam and serene beach.Its very beautiful beach and there is a park next to the beach which is also very nice and is great for yoga or meditation
Sanjeev G,"Hyderabad, India",May 2017,Nusa dua beach is beautiful and heaven for surfers had a amazing time at this beach as it is not crowded and good for sunrise üåÖ would suggest must visit once as it's near to the Bali collection mall 
Gyorgy Sipos,"Exeter, UK",May 2017,We did hope to find a nice beach in Bali well another disappointing beach with rubbish and pollution 
Rob G,"Ellesmere Port, UK",May 2017,"We love this beach, it is safe, sandy and has a lovely look to it. It is accessible from most of the resort hotels. Most hotels have put buoys in the water to mark the safe for swimming limit.There are a few hawkers selling wares and water sports, however they are not pushy and if you gently tell them 'no thanks' they tend to leave you alone."
Kath H,"Albany Creek, Australia",May 2017,Beautiful white sandy beach and perfectly clear water. The downside is a very strong undertow which takes away the relaxation.
Greg C,"Bournemouth, UK",May 2017,"This is a wonderful beach, very clean, great for photos and swimming, stayed here in Laguna hotel and it was fantastic, so pleased with our choice."
AjaySheth,"Bengaluru, India",May 2017,"The waters are just amazing.. You can surf, swim, dive at your will... Superb place to be.. Many water sports are available at Tanjim Benoa beach... you can hire one of them.."
Explorer19,"Mumbai, India",May 2017,"The beach in front of The Grand Bali, probably the cleanest of the lot.It was quiet and peaceful. Free entrance but sundowner chairs were available at two hundred thousands for three hours. Else, you will need to order something at their restaurant if you prefer to sit in the shade of the trees. Also, don't forget to visit the 'Water blow' nearby."
Lenka G,Indonesia,May 2017,"Nice restaurants are nearby.  The beach is clean, with beautiful azure and deep blue colour of the ocean."
faith t,2 contributions,May 2017,"Beautiful location and relaxing spot. The beach is clean, with food and drinks nearby. Plenty of swimming area too."
Chidawgo,"Chicago, IL",May 2017,"The beach would be beautiful if not for the sad consequences of human behavior. Most of the resorts pick up the trash every morning, but some of the areas have piles of it along the shoreline. I was sad to see children playing in garbage in one of the public beach areas. Even along our resort area that was well maintained, you couldn't escape the occasional garbage washing ashore or floating alongside you in the water. It's really too bad this has happened, but if you've been to Bali, you know trash isn't just a Nusa Dua issue. "
TravellingTomas,"Ballito, South Africa",Jun 2016,"Soft white sand, crystal clear turquoise water, this beach is lined with exciting destinations and places to quench that sun dried thirst, the swimming is very safe and the water is heavenly. "
William,"Beirut, Lebanon",Apr 2017,"Did not like Nusa Dua. the beach is dirty and full of solicitors for activities. We tried jet skiing, it was a horrible experience it stopped twice, one in the middle of the ocean. we also did a donut ride which also was horrible. Just no"
Miamosaics,"Brighton le Sands, Australia",May 2017,I wanted a relaxing getaway and I got it.  Nusa Dua is peaceful and a quieter destination for Bali.   It is high security location.
Cherry L,Bunbury,Apr 2017,"I would definitely not recommend this beach for families with children, in particular young children especially in the mornings. The beach itself was nice and clean but the undertow is very strong and although I am a strong swimmer I was swept off my feet. I am told the afternoon is a lot calmer, however I cannot confirm this."
Estee,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2017,Beach is very dirty & renting of chairs is overpriced. Got offered RP300k for 1 chair by the beach. LOL
Carol B,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Mar 2017,We had many great day over our 10 day stay water was clear and the beach was constantly being cleaned Marriott supplied sand toys and towels and lounges and we could charge food and drinks to our room and it was exclusive for the guest of the Marriott couldn't have asked for better the walk along the beach is lovely with some breathtaking resorts as well as scenery 
579sharon,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2017,"The beach is beautiful! Being the main beach for Club Med, Grand Whizz Hotel, Nikki Beach Bali and more, there's plenty of activity! definitely worth a visit!!"
mark t,"Swansea, UK",May 2017,Beach is cleaned daily of any sea weed and rubbish. Sand is vey soft but also a little course. Only two things to note: first us and is very very soft and when walking in it you can sink a couple of hours inches which makes it hard walking but good exercise. Second when tide goes out which is a long way cannot swim in sea so need a hotel with good pool.
rajarshis2013,33 contributions,May 2017,"This may not be the best beach in mainland Bali as beaches in gilli trawangan and lembogan are better,but in Bali mainland this is the best u can get.It's absolutely hawker free, kids can run around freely and one can have a relaxing tan any time of the day.The best thing about this beach is the fact that u can leave it valuable without worrying about it.In front of Inaya putri and grand hotel you will get a flat bed portion where swimming is easy and fun.The water swells a bit during afternoon so early morning and evening after 4 is the perfect time to take a dip."
Natalie K,"Toronto, Canada",May 2017,Fine beaches and gorgeous clear blue water. I would highly recommend this destination anyone planning a honeymoon.
Rafik A,51 contributions,May 2017,the beach has dazzling view but when we got in the water we found many tree leaves. also it has sellers everywhere which is really annoying
Sara Goldstein,"New London, CT",May 2017,"I stayed at a resort close to Nusa Dua but I didn't spend too much time at the beach there. It was a little crowded with tourists (not terrible but trying to have a peaceful beach visit with screaming children and loud tour groups around was difficult.) The beach was a little dirty and the water was not as clear as I would have hoped. However, if you do some exploring you can find some good, less touristy beaches. Overall it was a decent beach but I have seen better. "
Kenneth,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2017,The beach is not clean as it is unless it's the private beach. Pandawa beach is much better if you planning to visit the public beach.
M P,"Hamburg, Germany",May 2017,"Nice beach - very calm & relaxing! Beautiful resorts & pure nature! If you do not want to have entertainment & want just relax, come to Nusa Dua beach! "
Brownprincess L,110 contributions,Apr 2017,"On photographs this beach looks like it is white and powdery like the ones found in Cuba, Mexico and Dominican but sadly we were disappointed to find a darker grainier sand and definitely needed sea shoes as my youngest son trod on an urchin on first day of our holiday and had to have several black small spines removed with tweezers.Looks so different when the tide goes out."
SadyaHossain_Sinthi,Bangladesh,Dec 2016,"Hands down the best beach of bali. The sand is powdery white and the ocean very blue. If I ever go back, will stay there for sure!"
Dragos B,13 contributions,Apr 2017,"Very beautiful beach, but with high waves at high tide. Great for surf beginers. You should find along great hotels, restaurants, bars or beach clubs with meals and beverages"
Hannah P,"Birmingham, United Kingdom",May 2017,"It is a lovely beach but unfortunately lots of rubbish coming in from the ocean and it is not a calm ocean, not great for swimming. "
Kiwiontour_50,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",May 2017,"If you are looking for a pristine beach with white sand and deep blue water, look no further.  I went on an afternoon that was hot and humid but the beach was bearable because of the sea breeze. Surf was rolling in but the red flags were out so swimming was not encouraged but I was told this is not always the case. There are several international hotels along the beach so drinks and ice cream are never far away. When I was there the beach was not crowded, though it wasn't peak season. "
MykeAlpha,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2017,"Don't get it wrong, I love Bali and I love Balinese stuff however this doesn't apply on this place. Overpriced water sports, polluted sea for scuba divers and unfortunately almost no fish for snorkelling."
Voyage104484,46 contributions,Apr 2017,"The public beach section at Nusa Dua is one of the best spots in Bali. Good beach, lovely ocean water, all the beach options, even though some are charging rates comparable to all the nearby large resorts. The local beach co-op has great food at cheap prices, and one of the best locations in Bali. "
Jane G,2 contributions,May 2017,Wonderful visit. Nusa Dua Lagoon Luxury Resort is as good as ever. We really enjoyed the spa. Mersi and Nia and Wiwik are hugely talented. Thank you so much 
patrick_kowalczyk,london,May 2017,most popular beach mainly for 5 stars resort so you are not much able to rent sun bed chairs around. good for swimming and long walks 
Abang Lexa,"Jembrana, Indonesia",May 2017,"I'm just walking around near my hotel, so i just want look beach, And woww !!, It's so beautiful place ever And ever üôå"
Guru-Grul,"Zagreb, Croatia",Jan 2017,Nice beach with couple resorts for families. Close to surf point and surf rent equipment. Very hot sea around 30 degrees in january.
Priyal P,"Miami Beach, FL",May 2017,"Compared to Kuta and Seminyak, this beach is quieter and more secluded so its perfect for relaxing and catching a tan.The lagoon is a lovely area to swim and if you want to catch waves, you can go further in. Did not do any activities at this beach but overall its a beautiful clean beach!"
mimi918,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"One of the famous beach at Bali , the beach was clean and the wave are not so strong. It's a good place for kid play at the beach."
Amish J,5 contributions,May 2017,Visited Nusa Dua Beach great place with very very clean water and very good for water sports all are good and all bargain and give u good deal for water sports Thanks Amish 
rosievil,"Yeovil, UK",May 2017,"It's not white sand , I would say it is a golden sand . It's a very nice quite sandy beach not crowded . I recommend this beach to those who love to be relaxed. "
ishe2014,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,"Perfect to getaway from the crowd and have the beach your own. It is clean,You could see a beautiful sunrise. "
linda menzies,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2017,Went to courtyard Marriotts beach bar you get free shuttle there every 30 minutes nice lounges with towels waiter service for drinks and food 
Argya N,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"We went there during the New Year holiday and it was really full of people. Most of them are domestic tourist, and what they did was similar with what people did in Kuta few years ago: picnics, bring the whole family, and spend some times on the beach. Probably empty on off-peak season. The sand was albeit coarse."
SunnytheTraveller,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2017,"They keep this beach clean and free of litter. It is very shallow far out with minimal surf, so little kids can enjoy their time out there. The sand here is really neat, and looks like little pellets. The hawkers are minimal here compared to other beaches."
nikkibrown14,"London, UK",May 2017,"Visited the Melia Bali in April as a solo traveller. The hotel, staff, manicured grounds, ambience and food in all the restaurants was indeed very good  and in some cases exceptional. A large hotel... perhaps a little dated but this does not detract from the experience. Very clean and welcoming.The beach is lovely albeit not on the scale of the beaches to recent visits to Mauritius and Sri Lanka. Tended to be hounded by beach vendors.I had a swim up premium lagoon room which on hindsight would not book again as could not use most of the time in April as the evening rains waterlogged the sun beds so could not use!The restaurants are superb and I can not fault any of them frombreakfast to a la carte evening meals. The standard of cuisine is indeed of the highest quality.Bali is a beautiful island and her islanders are indeed proud to show her off... however I found it very touristy and a little congested in places in particular Denpasar where traffic jams are commonplace.Enjoyed my visit but will not be rushing back anytime soon."
Michelle H,6 contributions,May 2017," Amazing place, a must if in Nusa Dua, his is a great place if you don't want to spend stupid money on hotel meals but still want the service and the quality of food we made the mistake of eating in the hotel for 3 days and it cost a fortune but here we have eaten well and gone back to our rooms drunk as skunks on minimal cost , I'm not an alcoholic but I enjoy my holidays and thanks Mr Bobs for helping ."
Uncle_Vin,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,not the white sand type and quite coarse actually so you need to wear something walking on the beach. not in  tourist season so the beach is empty! my private beach!  Feel quite safe here even though i am alone at night. 
lisat65104,"Geraldton, Australia",Apr 2017,Stayed at hotel along beach strip. Water temp cooler than pool. Salty but had outdoor shower afterwards. You sink into sand at waters edge so have to be careful.
Craig S,3 contributions,May 2017,Great beach. Especially at low tide because the reef protects a huge lagoon. Warm clear water. Friendly locals.
Amanda G,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,the sand was clean but the surf wasn't but what do you expect when everyone dumbs rubbish on the ground!! the private beach had a big beautiful tree to get some shade was relaxing to watch people had they pass & read!! 
WorldofJoy,"Derby, UK",Mar 2017,"Lovely Coleman  sloping beach that takes you into warm crystal clear waters, the beach itself is sparsely populated."
DaveBennett49,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,"We normally swim in the hotel section of the back close to The Blow. When the tide is up, its a nice place. At low tide, we sit in the shade, read and enjoy a beverage. Less than the Kuta level of harassment from junk sellers but still annoying. "
alengirl905,"Miami, FL",Apr 2017,We enjoyed our time here and the beach.  My children could not get enough of it!  I loved gathering beautiful shells on the shore.
AlexJH83,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Clean, plenty of places to drink and eat, very good late afternoon when the breeze comes in and sunsets"
Sue W,"Sheffield, UK",Apr 2017,Clean beach with lovely warm sea. Sun beds available and also waiter service from local bars. Recommend a walk to blow hole.
Trishpearce,"Staffordshire, UK",May 2017,The beach shelves quite steeply in areas and the waves can be strong in certain areas along the beach I would not recommend it for small children.  It took me off my feet and I found it difficult to get up and I'm used to jumping through big waves of Cornwall.  The sand is shaile in places and large areas have sharp pieces of coral.  I would recommend rubber shoes also there is a lot of litter in the sea!!! Also lots of seaweed and the water in some areas is oily due to the boats and jet skis. We stayed at the melia and the sun loungers are on top of each other but you can move them to get your own bit of space also be prepared for a long walk out to the sea because it does go out quite far but this is late afternoon.  On a good note the water is warm
Mel D,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"It's beautiful and inviting, but be careful of rips and currents! Also found a needle in the sand üòû"
BUGI_70,"Florence, Italy",Apr 2017,"Course not the most beautiful beach in Bali but,  especially for swimmers or if you travel with kiddos,  it's a good one. If you enetr the Nusa Dua hotels complex,  no way to get to the beach so,  right outside,  on the left side,  park at the public parking for  2k IDR.Swimming is possible only with the high tide,  so before 3.00 pm.  No sunbeds to rent, no restaurants nor bars. No good for surfers. Quite crystal clear water and white sand. "
aquafinatraveller,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,"difficult to walk on the sand but the view was great, easy to swim during calm sea, the area is great for relaxing  "
Dr Javed R,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2017,"Interested in serenity and in a clean beach? This is the place to spent time. Several world class hotels are located on the shore, and you can enjoy various water sports."
NessyJ87,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,"Nusa Dua beach has always been amazing, but in recent years I've found the beach to be over crowded with lounge chairs, you have people on top of you, which is also contributing to the trash being left / in the water, everyday I pulled out a minimum of 15 pieces of garbage. When I first came to Nusa Dua beach, you had room to move / breathe, I could move my chair into the sun / shade as I wished, enjoyed a beach massage at a reasonable price and a cold cocktail while enjoying the serenity, now you're on top of the people next to you, the massage prices have increased to $50 AUD (for a beach massage!!) which of course you can still bargain down to $10 AUD or less, the price of the lounge chairs has also increased and the noise levels from the over crowding kills the chilled out beach vibe feels.My most recent visits were in December 2016, January 2017 & again March 2017.The private beach at the other end of Nusa Dua's Mulia Resort however is beautiful & similar to what the old Nusa Dua beach was like, pristine and relaxing. "
freddieqq,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,"Not too crowded at this time of the year.  Perhaps this may be a low season possibility due to very  hot, humid and dry weather.  No too many beach paddlers.Beautify beach with fine sand but with interspersed shells on the sand. Further into the water are beds of seaweeds or sea plants which give an ""eerie"" feeling to some.Must say the water is clear and able to see the sea bed."
Thouwaiba,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2017,"Nice place to do water activities as parasailing (cost you 55 dollars ), jet ski , or you can go to turtle üê¢ island . "
Janja1983,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Apr 2017,It's a nice beach. You can swim or surf. A lot of waves. It can a little bit dirty but they clean the trash that ocean brings. The beach is located on the area with a 5 star hotels. You can go to the waterblow and take pics there.
Harry L,"Terrigal, Australia",Apr 2017,Be prepared to chase the tides or arrange your swim at high tide. Beach was clean enough for a busy Bali resort and not too commercial. 
Mercy B,"Dubrovnik, Croatia",Apr 2017,"Th at leastere is no doubt that this beach is beautiful. However, the waves are often too strong for people to swim safely. Hotels along the beach post flags, red more often than not, warning people not to swim. This was the case in April"
Olivia C,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,"Very beautiful beach to explore.  You can go to the beach near Bali Collective to hire a long bed or just chill on the beach, it's a little busier up this end with the restaurants etc or go to the other end of Nusa Dua out of the upmarket Nusa Dua resort area and find a spot on the beach for just you. "
raymond1814,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"This is a beautiful stretch of beach. Beautiful white sand and cleaned everyday of debris that gets washed up during the night. A thing to keep in mind is to be aware of the tides. As at high tide it is great for swimming, but at low tide you have to walk a long way to get into water you able to swim in. Good for surfing as well."
Ken M,17 contributions,Feb 2017,Lovely long beach. Blue water. Great sunrise. Great for a stroll with your partner. Was low season when we went so wasnt packed like I have read in other reviews..and there was not many activities to do when we were around... saw some camel rides happening..but not to our interest. Good to swim when it is high tide. Would recomend for honeymooners.. just remember it is a resort area..one after the other with private beaches
jessk811,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,Stayed at the Westin Loved staying there but no water sports best to go next door to Laguna Nice to walk the path after a meal and nice that can go to any hotel for a meal whenever you like Beach could be cleaner. 
Kttreadinglightly,197 contributions,Apr 2017,"A beautiful spot in Bali to soak up the sun on the sand. Ver child friendly beach, as the reef is far out which breaks the large waves, thus the surfers are quiet a fair way out from the beach. Hawkers are regulated by the resorts and offer local wares and water sports. Bargaining is a must, prices are quoted in USD, and ensure you get detailed information on where and how the activity is being conducted. My experience in parasailing, was that a water taxi took me to a beach a few resorts up, to wait for a JetSki to take me to another small boat outside the reef, then the small boat took me to the larger bust that I parasailed from. All this without anything on me but my swimming costume & GoPro..... so yes it felt pretty uncomfortable not knowing what I was in for. A path along the waterfront links the resorts, about a 2 km stretch"
chipj72,"Meredith, NH",Apr 2017,The area of the beach we visited was private to our hotel. It was well taken care of and had plenty of room for whatever activities you wanted at the beach. 
Pradatta,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Apr 2017,This place is very relaxing. The view is awesome and me and my wife had a wonderful time there. This beach also has adjacent golf courses like park. The panoramic view is mind boggling. There is a Waterblow but we did not see that. This place two beach on the both side of the walk way and they different and has two different kind of charms.
Julija P,"Bristol, England, United Kingdom",Apr 2017,It's a lovely beach and I would definitely visit it in BaliIt's not Caribbean beach but close enough The thing is that the current was strong and it makes it difficult to swim and it gets deep after a you steps you make into the seaIt's a lovely beach to go for a walkDefinitely enjoyable place to see :)
Ange E,182 contributions,Apr 2017,"This beach is seriously amazing, the color of the water, the cleanliness. It was never too busy - we visited every single day of our holiday. Nothing compares to being in that water! Just wow! "
lsylviano,"Bandung, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"The little wave made my toddler loves the ocean instead of scaring him away like those in Kuta Beach. Sand was white, a little rough to walk barefoot for newbies but very quickly getting used to it."
Ashley K,"Kelowna, Canada",Apr 2017,Nice beach. Lots of resorts along the way to stop for lunch or beverages. A little higher priced than other restaurants off the beach. 
YogiAndTheBee,Sweden,Apr 2017,"The Yogi:After a nice scooter ride from Uluwatu to nus dua we found the best beach we saw in Bali. Maybe because its quite clean and no annoying people bothering you. Could recommend you to go here if you just want a beach where you can swim in the ocean and that feels safe and clean. The Bee:After seeing a couple of beaches in Bali i was very disappointed but this is actually the only one that was clean, didn't smell and was not crowded. They had life guards and public showers. We took a scooter so we parked really close to the beach. There are trees so you can get shadow if you don't want to be in the strong sun. I didnt eat/drink/rent sun beds so cant say anything about that."
Michael_Teoh,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"It's are nice and clean beach with stunning view, great place where to swim and have fun..like an heaven and enjoy our day there.."
pommie1,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,Great sandy beach which is very clean as there are people raking up the sea grass.Many of the Nusa Dua hotels back onto this beach so there are plenty of place to grab a drink and eat.Good for swimming and water sports it was not rough when we're there.
Lee B,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"Sadly there was a level of plastic in the water which was annoying. However people came every day to clean, so they are making an effort to improve. "
Maya K,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Apr 2017,Nusa Dua is it's own private gated beach club community. We came through Kayumanis and the beach was absolutely beautiful. It was quiet and relaxing. Safe for tourists.
Abdelmajid A,15 contributions,Jun 2016,"It's a great place with definitely stunning view, great place where to swim and have fun, i enjoyed spending my day over here .. "
December1959,"Isle of Wight, UK",Mar 2017,"Great location within gated secure area with many other lovely hotels.  Beautiful reception and public areas.  Many good restaurants and bars. Reasonable value food but beech restaurants are better, cheap and cheerful.  Rooms good but a bit dated now.  A/C not cold enough.  Staff friendly and helpful.  Good family hotel."
ramchabi,"Chennai (Madras), India",Apr 2017,Based on the tides this is 3 beaches combined into 1.  Low tide and the beach traces back. Medium and water upto your knees and high tide then you ready to surf. Kids and adults galore love it. 
Chris D,"Bay of Plenty Region, New Zealand",Apr 2017,we were staying at grand hyatt so outside our door step . nice and cleaned every day  quite private for our area 
Riaz Karim,"Coonoor, India",May 2016,"nice beach. calm and quiet. very good for relaxing, taking a book and have a nap at the beach side. The beach activities also are very thrilling. but this is as not vibrant as the Kuta having less crowd"
WestLondonDiner,"London, UK",Apr 2017,Recommend this beach. But it's a funny beach with high tide and low tide. Sea is very clear. One side of the beach needs work on and the other side is nice. Some annoying people selling stuff. The beach is calm and relaxing and we loved it. 
marchcarrasco,"Mexico City, Mexico",Apr 2017,"Nice spot  rest and spend time with family or couple, away from the crowded spots in Bali Nice to swim, take a bike, walk, paddle in the ocean, or simply get a tan and relax "
gabby b,"Ramallah, Palestinian Territories",Apr 2017,"The beach at this hotel is great- clear clean water, with the added bonus of bean bags under shade and food and drink brought to you. Heaven if you ask me! "
Feby H,53 contributions,Apr 2017,"Well it's perfect for families beach vacation. Quiet wave, turquoise blue water, white sands. It's really easy to go there. Surrounded by luxurious resorts and become one of luxurious area in bali. I think it's not suitable for surfing. It's really good for swimming, cause nusa dua beach is more like big blue pool. You can walk around to water blow that located in peninsula island. Really nice place to chill "
rebel_diamond56,"Hereford, UK",Apr 2017,"Perfect beach for spending a relaxing day. Plenty of shade under the trees, soft, clean sand and friendly squirrels. Were staying at Grand Hyatt who manage this part of the beach. Drinks and snacks can be ordered. There is also beach volleyball available. The sea was quite strong and some people were surfing. It was much nicer than sitting by the rather busy pool."
mladenvassilev,"Plovdiv Province, Bulgaria",Apr 2017,the wide beach with golden sand... it is nice in the morning with big waves and in the afternoon  without water because of the tide////  
AidaBlatPalacios,Singapore,Apr 2017,This is the cleanest and more current-free beach in Bali. Fantastic. The best part is between the Hyatt and St Regis. 
yousuff,21 contributions,Apr 2017,This beach was right behind the hotel we stayed. I felt it was one of the nicer beaches. This location is perfect to view sunrise. We got up about 6am to catch the sunrise.  Perfect.
David M,"London, UK",Apr 2017,This is a beautiful long beach with great views of ocean and distant mountains. The beach is kept clean by the hotels and the water is an amazing colour and a great temperature 
glear,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"One of the best beaches in Bali, particularly if you get there at high tide and you are staying at one of the hotels that rent a small area of the beach for their guests."
Robert L,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Apr 2017,We stayed at Melia Nusa Dua and they are taking care of there part of the beach as well as they can. In Asia there is always problem with plastic floating every where and it also ends up at Nusa Dua beach. 
ChrisMediwaka,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"It is a beautiful beach with crystal clear water. it does have low tides and high tides. during low tides, you can go for a walk in the sea and see some amazing sea creatures like starfish and mud crabs. be careful when swimming as there were warning signs for jellyfish and sea urchins. Beautiful beach to walk. lot of sport activities available to do as well."
RRoedel,"Florianopolis, SC",Mar 2017,"A very good option of beach to surf or just chill out. It is well maintained and cleaned, with good food/drink options. Definitely is a ""must see"" in Bali."
Ece B,5 contributions,Apr 2017,"We came here with high expectations, having seen many beautiful fotos of Bali beaches. Unfortunately, the beach and the sea was full of waste; plastic bags, old shoes, chips packs, bottles, even a syringe... it is sad to see how we ruin beauty.. Also, the water is not clear but this is still ok as it is sandy and the waves cause the sand to blur the waters.. the tide is nice to watch.. the rent for beach banks under the shadow is around 15 USD for 3 hrs.. you can find drinks and snacks at many small food stalls along the beach. Worth a trip, but manage your expectations. "
Peter_ACT_OK,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,"This beach was just what we were looking for.  Quiet, clear blue waters and clean sand.  The Beach Club called Agendaz was also great."
stripedblood,"Huddersfield, UK",Mar 2017,The beach is beautiful with fantastic views and hotels and restaurants and bars leading onto it. Security is subtle and beach sellers are not pushy and managed well. They also sell beautiful goods. The sea is clear and warm like a bath. Just gorgeous 
Ealingdave,"London, UK",Apr 2017,You have to get here at high tide or you won't be able to swim. Lots of rubbish on the beach and in the sea. You can hire paddle boards and paddle around the lagoon when the tide is up. You have to pay for beds unless you are staying in one the hotels. Some shade under the trees. 
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2017,So nice to find a clean unpollutted  beach that offers  Otho Stillwater and out the back a reef with some of the best surfing. There are boats on hand to take surfers to the reef if they don't feel like a long paddle.  Beach is full of sand and there are places that hire out deck chairs and umbrellas. 
gradedmeeting,"Falkirk, UK",Apr 2017,Beautiful beach and water at exactly the right temperature. Only thing to be aware of are:1. At high tide the water gets deep very quickly2. At low tide soft sand is exposed which can sometimes make it a little tricky getting out of the water 
Sanchita S,India,May 2016,A beautiful clean beach with blue water lashing every now and then.  Thete are a host of water sports activity to choose from. 
Jagdish J,"Chennai (Madras), India",Apr 2017,"White sands, beautiful view of the ocean, snorkelling. Simply breathtaking and amazing. We had a good time."
Faye P,19 contributions,Apr 2017,Very relaxing Great for watersports- jet ski- banana boats- flying fish - boat hire You can barter the companies to a great price too! 
Steve A,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Blue water and great surf..All you could want from a beach.So much better than Kuta or legian and very clean water..
DrTravel 007,191 contributions,Mar 2017,"Staying at one of the 5 star hotels in Nus Dua gives you direct access to this place. Relaxing, walking, swimming etc are all great here. Hotels are very expensive here but the beach is priceless. You could also eat at any of the hotels restaurants and enjoy the sunset."
Duncan M,"Auckland, New Zealand",Apr 2017,Clean and tidy - sandy beach which is safe to be with kids. Our children 9 and 11 enjoyed swimming around and having a snorkel - there were lots of fish to see.
joaojpalma,"Cascais, Portugal",Apr 2017,"Nice views, clean sand, water shallow and warm. No waves, impossible to drown.Very good place to relax and enjoy life"
agustinjuan,Chile,Apr 2017,The beach and the water was gorgeous. Lot of people are visiting here. Good location for photography. There are some shops which are selling food and dresses
Jim W,"London, UK",Feb 2017,"Nice sandy beach, looked pretty safe, plenty of shade along the hotel front. The water was clean and shallow at the beach edge."
XVictorious,"Austin, TX",Apr 2017,"This beach is the primary reason we travelled to Bali. The fine sand is unlike most beaches in the world. It's principally coral and shell that has been pulverized through millennia. There is little or no quartz or granite in the sand, which makes it great to walk through. The break and shallow tide area extends several hundred meters from the shore. The sand is raked in the am, but you can find coral bits and small shells throughout the day."
debbieSouthampton,southampton,Apr 2017,Although man made this beach is gorgeous. Lots of swimming but make sure you heed the advice about where to swim. It's clean lots of sun beds provided for each hotel
Rix_11,"Kewarra Beach, Australia",Apr 2017,"If you are staying at one of the 5 Str star hotels this is a great stretch of beach. Each hotel has security on hand to protect you from any unwanted attention and they have a variety of facilities. If you are not staying at one of the hotels, you can still enjoy the beach and water along with the range of cafes, restaurants and bars of the hotels. The beach is safe and extremely clean as it is raked every morning. There is a lovely long walking path which is shaded by trees."
JO B,"Manila, Philippines",May 2016,in general a nice beach .......in front of some hotels better then in front of other hotels. swimming only possible at high tide. beware of undercurrents.
janherwitz,"Pacifica, CA",Mar 2017,"Only there for one afternoon using a ""private"" beach from the Grand Bali Nusa Dua (they have a free shuttle). Very clean, very expansive, and low, low tide. Not one of the world's great beaches, but it sure was nice walking about 100 meters in the water and still being at knee's height!"
zesha_machdoem,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2017,"Great great beach if you're after some nice clean golden/white sand away from the hustle and bustle of bali. we stayed at The Mulia in nusa dua and the hotel has a private guest only Beach right by the beach! Excellent, it was clean peaceful beautiful photo worthy beach! loved it x"
Vini Vidi V,286 contributions,Apr 2017,Love this beach  clear  clean waterNice for  relaxing  and swimming Awesome place for families  and watersport.Tides can vary alot depend on time of the day
gavinsch,"Queenstown, New Zealand",Apr 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is terrific goes for miles, very very clean racked every morning. Most places along there have deck chairs etcYou don't get hassled like at Kuta and seminyakVery relaxing and most important the water is crystal clear"
AndrewSwann,"Camberwell, Australia",Apr 2017,"No big swell clean water and not deep. Plenty of activities and generally sheltered from the sellers typical to the area. As a nerd the beach sand is almost completely spherical like little beads. Not everyone cares about this though, I think it's somewhat fascinating."
Geoff S,Bandar Seri bagawan,Mar 2017,Beautiful beach facing the Indian Ocean. The sea can be rough but this makes for great family fun getting smashed by the waves. It gets calmer as the tide goes out for those less adventurous.
ElksLondon,London,Mar 2017,A pleasant enough beach but nothing stunning. Lots of private sections for the 5 star hotels. Lots of beach traders but they don't oversell.
SaraGhavam1979,"Tehran, Iran",Apr 2017,"For people coming to Bali, it's a must see although resorts have practically owned the beach ... but at the night time even, there are happenings."
Kim G,"Kindersley, Canada",Mar 2017,"Lined with hotels and restaurants, but with generous amounts of sand, you will enjoy the ambiance of this beach.  If you are a beginner surfer, you might enjoy taking a lesson and practicing here."
Alex V,15 contributions,Mar 2017,Clean and quite serene beach. The hotels have their own private plots so it is free from the vast amounts of sellers one would expect. Water was quite sandy but appears clean - with the exception of some palm leaves and flowers.  Surf is there but not very strong. Some ripcurrents marked with flags by the life guards. 
NiveditaSamanta,98 contributions,May 2016,Sandy beaches and blue waters- can't complain. It's clean and has some really nice views. Take a bicycle and explore!
AlkaSingh1120,"Faridabad, India",Mar 2017,"White sand, beautiful calm beach. Less crowded and very clean. Shallow water, can walk into upto few metres, in low tide its just knee depth water. Nice to take beach side walk with beautiful and calm surroundings."
Stelios M,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Mar 2017,"We stayed at Grand Hyatt hotel for 5 nights but every morning we were starting the day with long walks on the beach. The water was not very interesting for us (as we live in Cyprus where we have some very clean waters) and the tide made things worst at times.Nevertheless only seeing how long and clean the beach is, is an experience on its own. Sometimes jet lug is good as you wake up from 05.00 in the morning and you get to see the sunrise :)"
Michellecorrey,"Copacabana, Australia",Mar 2017,"White sand, crystal clear aqua water. Good for snorkelling. Very clean beach.  Each hotel has their own section of the beach with Su lounges. Not many beach sellers. "
Guillermo F,MEXICO CITY,Aug 2016,The ocean is aquamarine blue clean beautiful with very low tide you can walk 500 feet and only being knee deep the sand is soft white powder one of the most nicest beaches i ever saw .the beach was secluded at the hotel we stayed weather was sunny the sunset to look just impresive a very romantic place seems like paradise.
Azma O,"Toronto, Canada",May 2016,Definitely more for romance! lol I was unfortunately here on a work trip and the tide was quite low during the time I visited. Beautiful beach nonetheless. Way less touristy than other beaches in Bali. 
P M,San francisco,Feb 2017,"you can walk 300 feet during low tide and was is only knee deep.  beautiful white sand for miles.  There are areas with water sports as well, area outside our hotel is secluded and has few tourists."
Lookwhatlauraloves,"Doha, Qatar",Mar 2017,The water on sunny days was absolutely beautiful however when it was raining the water was very rough. I would not recommend this beach for a family with children due to how strong the tide is. My husband and I who are very strong swimmers were quite nervous with the strength of the waves. It is beautiful to dip in and look at but not the best swimming water. 
michaelt602017,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2017,We enjoyed our daily walks along the beach. Plenty to look at and always nice to have a swim at the many different locations. Never crowded !!!
Priyanka Kwatra,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2017,Beautiful calm beach with lovely places to eat. Good crowd and very clean. A must visit if you are with kids
Natalie K,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beautifully maintained, the sand was raked each morning by various resort staff.  Was very clean & secure"
Karin V,"Zhuhai, China",Mar 2017,"Great beach for swimming, very clean. Great for surfing and walking on the beach, great sunsets. Sales people on the beach a bit too pushy..."
Yacine,58 contributions,Mar 2017,"The beach is very beautiful and calm. Mostly only high end hotels here, not crowded. Was great to enjoy the camel ride on the beach."
Martin M,15 contributions,Mar 2017,Nusa Dua beach is amazing. The water is so blue and like swimming in a bath. There are various bars along the beach and you can walk from one hotel to another 
tlfraser,"Kelowna, Canada",Mar 2017,Clean lovely üòä Indian Ocean üåä- great restaurant on the beach to choose from.  Massage tables by the locals -‚ù§Ô∏è
Virrr777,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2017,This beach is on the West coast of Bali. So there is no Sunset & as it goes NO Crowd :(  you often see people in morning hours & most of this beach is broken down into private Beaches of the Properties around
The Wandering Reviewer,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"There are a number of hotels sprinkled along this beach and I've stayed at the Sheraton myself. It's a gated community and was designed to be an ‚Äòall-inclusive‚Äô type of tourist destination. The complex of world-class hotels, an up-market shopping complex with well-maintained facilities, a luxurious 18-hole golf course, white-golden sandy beaches and much more. The name Nusa Dua is derived from the two small islands to the east. Though it‚Äôs the most developed area in Bali, it still houses many temples, a museum, and lots of other attractions. Many people come here for their honeymoon. I found it 'just another' resort in an idylic place.The beach is good and I did see a great sea snake when snorkelling here. Also learnt to windsurf here. There is a reef about 200m off shore which means there is no surf.You will find local vendors trying to sell you stuff but they cannot enter the beach in certain areas so they try to haggle from a distance."
Zoe B,"Castleford, UK",Apr 2016,"not much shop/bar wise but loads of water activities!! jet skis were very good, can start to get pricey!"
KronSlater,38 contributions,Mar 2017,Number 9 gives a great strong massage and is also a great one to bargain with. Always look for number nine!
Mark P,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,"Quiet, peaceful and away from the hustle of other beaches in different resorts. if you want relaxation you should head down to Nusa Dua  "
Liz C,"Clayton, Australia",Mar 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is a beautiful and calm beach, great for swimming and spending the day.We had some lunch at one of the resorts and walked down the beach.Highly recommended :)"
Travel Beyond,"Honolulu, HI",Feb 2017,So nice with lots of restaurants...  This beach is so neat to walk along.  Lots of restaurants and vendors so we can never get hungry.  Hope to return soon.
philjanal,13 contributions,Mar 2017,"Beaches not so safe for anyone unless good swimmer, drop off pretty quick, but there is a safer part near Bali collection, good for kids. "
woo d,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,Beautiful backdrop of the ocean. Clear sea and clean beach. Security on the beach ensure the safety of the visitors staying  
domo82,"Newmarket, UK",Mar 2017,Would be great if not the sea weeds that are verry close to the shore ... not the best beach on the world but nice enough ..  
mxhdapxt,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"Easy access to the beach, no payment required or whatsoever. Beach is clean with beautiful sand and waves. Stretch of beach bars (area is fill with resorts). Beach is not as crowded as Kuta therefore it is worth going to. Good spot for suntanning. Water activities are available there too. If you don't intend to get wet, do not visit the beach. You'll get tempted with all the activities happening there. Ps, they have flowriders there too. Get on to their tiny islands and get to the edge of the cliff for a beautiful photo. If you're a fan of the water and the activities, you'll probably end up spending the whole day at nusa dua beach. Definitely a must place to visit when you're in Bali."
joyance,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"We had our own private beach area, although you can walk down the clean beach to the other side infront of other hotels or resorts. The sand is clean and beach area not to crowded. The waves were huge and since the red and yellow flag was up, we were just by the side to play in the waves, didn't swim out into the sea. With the rushing of the waves, my children had a great time jumping around. You can see many surfing too, I guess the waves are large enough for them. As the tides are strong, you need to be careful with very young children and not let them play alone at the shoreline."
balichick47,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,Clean water Clean sand but our was a private beach Lots of wedding pics being takenGood to people watchLots of choices for food etc
Harshanath I,4 contributions,Mar 2017,Nusa Dua beach is very clean and less crowded.  We stayed at Inaya Putri and had the beach access from the resort. Beach is safe for a swim and ideal for long walks.
Nicole0999,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,"Great clean beach and less touristy. Top restaurant on beach called Kauputi that I would highly recommend. Spectacular beach side view at ""the St Regis"". This area has the best resort hotels in Bali. More upmarket, clean and safer than other parts of Bali. Great shopping nearby with quality shops and restaurants. Ubud would be my second choice but for a different more laid back quiet experience. Enjoy!"
Xavier007_04,"Paris, France",Feb 2017,The beach of the south of Bali the water is clean the sand also.You have a lot of nice restaurant on the beach You can rent surf paddle ect ...
JaneMcc1965,"Manchester, UK",Mar 2017,The beach is huge great for long walks along the sand as well as a bit of beach combing. Very clean & unspoilt Lots of hotels at the back of the beach offering lots of places to eat or get a drink 
shashiwithlove,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2016,Most of the beaches in Bali are clean and they shine blue in afternoon. This beach is also safe and some activities are also done here. This beach is one of the safest to swim beaches in Bali. The sand are soft and great for a visit.
Michael Anbumani,"Seremban, Malaysia",Mar 2017,Beautiful beach with cool clean water. Nice beach to experience with children & adults. One of many popular beaches around Bali. Tourists love this beach.
junior g,Singapore,Mar 2017,A good place for anyone who enjoys white sand beach and clean clear waters. Good for swimming and on certain times for surfing.
Thecoventrykid,"Coventry, UK",Feb 2017,"Watch out for beach sellers selling Kites and dodgy watches. The sea is warm but a little rough, the red flag was flying through out our stay. good for surfing."
TrevorT-Bone,Male,Feb 2017,"I enjoyed the relaxing environment we had here i enjoyed  my pot of coffee just watching the beach and the sea go back and forth, and people watching what more is there todo."
ivan_darius,"Sanur, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"White sand beach, clear water to swim, plenty choices for beach activity, great cocktail at the nearby beach bar. Overall is good."
Mat G,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,I found this beach one of the cleanest (and quietest) in Bali. Sand is white and soft and great for long quiet walks with the one you love !!
Sachelle H,"Paris, France",Mar 2017,"An absolutely beautiful and relaxing beach! The water is a great temperature and nice and flat.There is alot of resirts on the beach that offer different settings, Ayodya resort has the best atmosphere.We hired some bikes and rode along the beach pathway which was lovely."
LILLY_BBB,"Belgrade, Serbia",Oct 2016,"White sand, turquoise water. It's only bad that you can not swim far from the beach. There are warning signs and when you reach them the ocean is still not deep enough. Local residents cannot reach the beach so it's pretty empty. Sometimes you can see few local woman selling souvenirs."
krummeltw,Perth W Australia,Feb 2017,"During our 13 day stay at the Westin Resort Nusa Dua we spent nearly every day swimming at this lovely beach.Water is not the same as you experience in Aussie beaches but is best located beach around Bali coast. Staff work hard to keep beach free of debris, day beds etc are kept clean and you can ask waiters for drinks or snacks.Plenty of activity on the water, snorkelling, jet ski, para gliding, etc. Nice beachfront for a walk, bike ride or stroll along to see the connecting Hotels. Only negative is the constant hassling from the Hawkers."
Terri T,"Calgary, Canada",Feb 2017,Beautiful aqua blue water. Perfect ocean temperature. Not too many peddlers. Lots of great places to eat and drink along the beach.
arievo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Good place for relax in the beach with white sand with long beach line. Located in the heart of Bali and many luxury hotels, make this beach so popular to visit."
RuxtonSun,BC,Feb 2017,"The beach drops off quite quickly at the shore line and then remains the same level for a long ways out.  It is like a huge swimming pool that empties when the tide is out, but then you can explore the tide pools, which is lots of fun!  We aren't surfers, but every day there were people out there catching waves.  It looks like the surf accommodates beginners as well as more advanced surfers.  Being near the equator, the water is always warm!"
Jolandita,"Stara Zagora, Bulgaria",Mar 2017,"One of the best beaches in Bali. Long beach line.Very clean water. Beautiful white sand. There are also lots of water activities especially if you are a beginner. Very good location to watch the sunrise, as well as the low tide periods. We saw some newlyweds taking photo sessions :) The area is quite safe and not overcrowded since most of the luxurious hotels are there. Maybe it is because most of the tourist think it is a private beach only for the hotel guests, but it isn't. There are also some locals selling paintings, wood craft etc. Be prepared to bargain if you want a fare deal :)"
varun b,2 contributions,Feb 2017,Hey friends beach sites view are beautiful so much clean and clear beaches really had so much fun at there
CorporateSud,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2017,A nice peaceful beach for a morning and evening walk with your partner....We enjoyed watching the sunset.......
MrsWarrior,"Birmingham, UK",Nov 2016,Lovely beach. Relaxing. The staff at the villa we were at had recommended this beach to us. We are glad we went. Friendly staff. Happy to help. Plenty of areas to sit and sun bathe or just relax. Drinks available to buy with ice. My husband went for a swim whilst I admired the sandy beach and breeze. Managed to find some beautiful shells that I bought back with me as souvenirs :)
ChristineBALI2016,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,Beautiful white sand (like in Perth Aus) clear water and lots of water activities but all round expensive for Bali
sophiejeffs,3 contributions,Mar 2017,"Great spot for families to stay if you want to relax. Not the best spot for the cheap shopping or cheap massages that most people come for. Here, you will pay a little higher price than in Kuta area but it's a clean sandy beach."
mikemcdowell2014,"Jarrow, UK",Mar 2017,"Great beach that has a gentle slope that is great if you don't want to out of your depth. Lots of sea grass underwater so the shore needs constant cleaning by the hotels...and gets itAll water sports can be catered for with numerous places on the beach offering their services. Don't settle on the first price as they will negotiate even if a few dollars. Bartering is fun so smile and enjoy,don't get annoyed but be prepared to have a walk away price Our friends went on the""flying fish"" and loved it. Hover boarding looked fantastic, looking in the hands of experts, like a scene from the Spiderman moviesPlenty of choice all the way alongLoads of food and juice available all the way along from the blow hole to Holiday InnLast tipTake water...it's gets hot"
JuliannaD,233 contributions,Feb 2017,"...all the visitors no natter from which hotel they are. Nusa Dua beach isn't private but meant to be used by tourists. It's clean and safe as there are security guards everywhere around the area. I'm not sure you'd be offered a hotel sunbed if you're not this particular hotel guest, but you definitely won't be asked to leave once you decided to stay at this beach. Night lighting is lovely)"
George P,"Budapest, Hungary",Jan 2017,"Then youhave got it. One thing you should make sure of though: go to the beaches by the hotel resorts! Those are the real thing really. There are entry points for any tourist, just ask or look for it.Then enjoy!"
636Debbied,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2017,"We spent many hours strolling down this beautiful beach.  Loved it!!  My husband tried his hand at waterskiing, an activity that he hasn't indulged in for many years.  The beach was kept immaculate by many bali workers.  Loved watching the cruise ships that anchored there."
KBJBWM,46 contributions,Feb 2017,Love this beach so much; there are many hotel around this area ! There is the water blow too !! Love it 
kirstyjane,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"Beautiful spot to walk along. Swimming 3/5 and snorkelling not possible. Great location, clean and presentable but don't get excited about tropical island. "
Diogo B,"Munich, Germany",Mar 2017,You cannot swim in the water because it's not so deep. No waves either. Great if you don't like crowded beaches and waves. Good beach for kids too due to the shallow water.
saraleenah,"Velika Gorica, Croatia",Feb 2017,"It is a gorgeous long sandy beach... but all the sunbeds and umbrellas are reserved for hotel guests, from different hotels. It is way to hot to be out on the sun, so you do need a cover, and the only way to do it is to walk all the way to the far end of the beach where the sunbeds can be rented for 50 IDR, however bear in mind that this part of the beach has a red flag for dangerous and it is not for children at all, since the waves are high and they push you back and forth in the shallow parts of the beach. It has a free shower which is great, and the taxis are nearby"
Leah H,24 contributions,Mar 2017,Clean with clear water in February and heaps of water sports.  Beach was kept clean and no hassling however you still could get massages or buy nick backs. 
Saveen S,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2017,"Visited in Feb 2017 and was very very quite during the day time.... believe it, was making some sounds during late hey...."
Tommy C,"Maui, HI",Feb 2017,"Located behind the resorts in the ""resort town"" of Nusa Dua, the beach is a popular place for tourists due to the proximity to their hotels.  The beach is polluted - trash and plastic debris can be found along the shoreline and in the water. Some spots may appear cleaner as some of the resorts rake the trash up each day. Heavy boat and jet ski activity in near-shore waters. The pollution situation on Bali beaches is significant and does not seem to be improving. There is a nice walking path along the beach. Great spot to catch the sunrise."
Ginny M,"Hartford, CT",Feb 2017,"This beach used to be a gem. Unfortunately ocean trash is ruining the beach. Bali needs to figure out how to dispose of its trash in a sustainable way. I don't think I would come back again. Years ago when I visited this beach , the beach and the water was gorgeous. At low tide I walked in tidal pools which looked like they came out of a Natural Geographic magazine. That is all gone now."
travelbugPJ,PJ,Feb 2017,"One of the best beaches around. Beautiful location, fine sands, clear blue water. A great place for a swim or just laze in the sun."
Muhammad Salman,"Lahore, Pakistan",Mar 2016,"It was Great experience to be in Bali for my Business Tour. Great Place, Great food  Great Place. Nice place"
Mukesh70,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2017,"This is one of the beat beaches of Bali. The site which I visited is close to hotel Hyatt. This beach is having slight rocks. Water is slightly dirty, not suitable to bath. Lot of people are visiting here. Good location for photography. There are some shops which are selling food and dresses."
Travelfreak2401,418 contributions,Jan 2017,This is a lovely beach for doing watersports activities...loved the water here...better to visit early morning...becomes very hot in the afternoon
victorl654,"Yucaipa, CA",Feb 2017,Nice beach but if you visit the south or southwest beaches you will be blown away! Visit Sunday's Beach club. 
Grace ‹î,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"This beach is full of water sports equipments, and I thought it would be a nice beach since the tour guide said its one of their top beaches but I cant see any special on this beach. The sand is more like of small stones and brown and painful to walk without sippers. Barely even have a place to chill without getting ask 10 times if you want to do water sports activity."
Gary B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,Very clean beach both sand and water sand is very white and clean water crystal clear and great to swim in walking track along beach or stroll on sand we stayed at grand Hyatt and direct access to beach never busy and not hassled by sellers but there around if you want something
Jenny B,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Feb 2017,The beaches are as beautiful as the photos shows unless the have just had a massive storm!  It's a lot quieter down in Nusa Dua which is great for families!  Be careful as there can be rips so swim between the flags!
mfitriani,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2017,"You can still find a quiet hidden spot in Nusa Dua. It's never as busy as the one in Kuta/Canggu. Lovely beaches with great people. Please pick up your own trash, or other that's around you. We need to take a good care of the places that we visit, even the smallest gesture counts. We come here at least once a week from Ubud."
viktorija,"Hvar, Croatia",Jan 2017,I was there in January and its amazing.... beach is so clean and sea is so green ! Only peace in Bali worth visiting üòÑ
Refiloe B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Staying at the St Regis meant that we had access to the private beach with its beautiful sunrise. As a runner, I went out every morning on the beach running trail and the beach is just beautiful, Im glad that I stopped to enjoy the sunrise most mornings. Even when it rains its pretty."
Ayman A,10 contributions,Feb 2017,I went to the beach in seminyak and nusa dual and for sure nusa dua is better regarding waves and scenary and the sand 
Bence V,"Budapest, Hungary",Feb 2017,"The good part of this beach is before you hit the water. It is not crowded, clean and nice, the tropical atmosphere is very relaxing.Unfortunately the water is barely transparent, and it is full of jetskis, speedboats and everybody seems to be in a hurry (or rather show off). This makes the beach practically unusable for more peaceful activities like snorkeling, kayaking or swimming."
Petros Ioannou,"Nicosia, Cyprus",Feb 2017,The most amazing and fantastic beach on the whole bali!clean sand that is cleaned every morning and relaxing beds for everyone
zerrin3,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,very clean the sand and the water was just amazing.  Great place to go swimming or go for a long walk
cajafjones,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,Very clean beach and a great place to enjoy the water or just relax. There are a lot of great resorts along this beach with the Inaya Putri  resort one of the best.
YDai,"Shenzhen, China",Feb 2017,"Compared with other beautiful beaches like those in Maldives„ÄÅMexico or Sanya, the beach at Bali may be a disappointment. Sand is rough and the color is almost gray, with lots of dirts in the water. "
Gary M,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"Best beach in Bali, this beach is on a very long stretch and is very clean and nice. The sea is calm and there are lots of activities which you can participate in also. "
Christopher V,14 contributions,Sep 2016,"Nusa dua beach is beautiful, it's not the finest sand but the views more than make up for it, some interesting sea life is easily accessible straight from the beach, we went snorkeling in the bay just off the beach, saw many fish."
Sibasish D,30 contributions,Feb 2017,"One of the best beaches in Bali ,Where you can hang around with your family .Altough most of the hotels have their Private Chairs which are reserved for their guests.But still you can hang around there .Great Place we spent almost entire day .You can also do sea surfing there ."
abbeyjennifer,"Cronulla, Australia",Feb 2017,"We visited Nusa Dua Beach yesterday and it was beautiful! Clean sand, clear blue and very warm water! It is a nice beach to swim at, although the waves were huge and if you don't go out far enough, your feet get swept up underneath you and you end up getting dumped in the wave! Very nice beach though! "
Tengiz_D,"Jurmala, Latvia",Feb 2017,"Clean, soft and beautiful, nice sand and water, so you can not only photo it, but swim also with your children"
soodprashant,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2017,Its a beautiful beach with many bays. Slightly rocky. Many water sports are available. Must for a run! 
Mithun S,6 contributions,Jan 2017,This beach is usually very crowded as it is visited by the locals too.However it wasn't dirty and was well maintained. A good place to visit but definitely not mandatory. 
peyman s,"Tehran, Iran",Feb 2017,"It has white sand, very clean, various hotels and bars, soft sand, its not as lively as other beaches is bali,  yet it depends what you are after."
Carmigcar,Spain,Jan 2017,"We spent the day here with our balinese friend butu and his family. Very crowded but well worth the visit. Rented some loungers & spent most of the day in and out of the sea. Legs quite raw by being tossed around in the waves. Quite rough golden sand, boats to rent, massage etc."
terrykow,189 contributions,Jan 2017,"We were brought by a tour guide to nusa dua for snorkeling and water sport. Really dissappointed. The water is not clear at all and strong wave. Snorkeling and diving are wasting time. The boat for tourists are old and handled by local ppl. The safety awareness is very low. We realised there were only 5 life jackets for 7 ppl and 2 of the jacket were broken. Later, I found out from local ppl that the sea water at nusa dua is only be clear at August but strong wave plus dark at January. OMG,  tour guide and the water sport staff were never inform us about this. They just encourage you to go go go to earn your money by jeopardising your safety."
Beca15Ler,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,Nice clean water and white sand is suitable for relax and get sun during see the blue ocean. also close to the many restaurant 
Rosario E,47 contributions,Jan 2017,"I would avoid Nusa Dua, the sea has oil and the beach is so so, is better to go to the other side of the peninsula, Padang Padang beach - Rock Bar and if you want to go southern the best is the Sundays beach club, on both options you need to pay but it worth it. Nusa Dua is done! "
ArneMid,"Oslo, Norway",Jan 2017,"We are taking a few days of during CNY from Kuala Lumpur, thus wanted to try Bali this time. Nusa Dua beach is very nice by sand and water quality. Nice promenade along the beach also. But, the tide was a bit hefty, thus at low tide, it was not possible to go for any swim."
WWong77,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Also like a private beach as it mainly only the resort guest uses it but disappointed with cleanliness, lots of plastic bags and plastic bottles in the water."
bamunited2017,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"Beautiful idillic area, gorgeous.Views are beautiful of mountains and islands in the distance.Quiet for the majority of areas that are private for the resorts.Shame about the rubbish, particularly in the areas that aren't private, as the majority of locals and kids seem to swim in these areas but there's so much rubbish everywhere :("
H109,"Lund, Sweden",Jan 2017,Fantastic beach! Clean water and shore. Well organized service from the hotel.Perfect for long walks.
Wisnu A,16 contributions,Jan 2017,"I always come to this place like 2 times a month. Calming atmosphere, and sometimes I do jogging on the Peninsula Island. And if you wanna watch the sunrise, go to the waterblow"
Mathurahan S,"Vavuniya, Sri Lanka",Sep 2016,"Born and Grown in country full of great beaches,  I really enjoyed my trip to Bali. Especially for it's water games. Very clean beachesNot much disturbance from sellers. You will enjoy ur time in Bali... "
Kepr,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,"Beautiful beach..clear water, lovely sand. Excellent beachfront walkway in front of all of the luxury resorts & their restaurants, which are open to the public. You pay for the upmarket area, but still a great place to sit back & enjoy. Nusa Dua means 2 islands (they are actually headlands) that are interesting to visit. One has a temple  on it & the other has a big park with a huge statue & ""the blow"". "
GuideSabina,"Prague, Czech Republic",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dua is long stretch which I would describe in two sections.The first/northern part with the promenade marked on maps is beach with pricey resorts which take their section of the beach and water sports.The second/southern part (Mengiat beach) we liked much better as there is no section designated to a resort. This is nice long stretch of clean sandy beach where you can get sun chairs and umbrellas (or not if you do not want to), you can hire a kayak or just enjoy swimming or snorkeling. This was our favorite place which we have visited several times."
zjv76,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,By Balinese standards this is a very nice beach for families.  It's very calm and quite clean.The hotels ensure they clean their strip of beach daily to keep it looking good.
DITSVK2016,"Kozhikode, India",Jan 2017,It's nice and clean beach Especially for surfing Who love surfing can choose it Local Peoples are nice and honest Regards Vk
Nihar Shah,125 contributions,Jan 2017,"I would recommend Nusa Dua beaches for swims and relaxation.. Much better than Kuta or Seminyak where there are hundreds of people, vendors, etc. to bother you.."
Intan_edinin,"Semarang, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"Nusa dua beach was very beautiful, it has beautiful white sand and very clean. It very comfort to play in nusa dua beach with your children and nusa dua beach not too crowded."
glust,South Korea,Jan 2017,This is a calm type of beach. The sand is good and the water is kind of clear but not for too much snorkeling.
Sandy_Roadwarrior,"Ooty (Udhagamandalam), India",Feb 2016,Decent experience. But there are definitely better places/beaches in Bali. Avoid watersports in this area. Not the best of equipment used 
CarlyLovesCoffee,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2016,"Stunning! We stayed at Holiday Inn and wandered along the beach. You can buy corn and sarongs etc from beach vendors, but it is not overcrowded. Action and adventure water sports are popular here. We loved it. "
JessPattoAUS,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dua beaches are by far the best in bali.. white sand and blue water! If I was to return to Bali for another beach holiday, Id go back for sure!"
grahamandleonie,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,"Shuttle provided by Marriott resort. Drinks and food available also . Surf board hire is cheap, lounges and umbrellas available . "
Tanuj Goyal,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2017,My resort was on Nusa Dua beach only.  Water is clean and calm. Not much crowded (atleast the resort where we stayed). Enjoyed the place.
Barbara L,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,"I think this beach has both beauty & tranquillity and offers a beautiful sunset in the evening.  The sand and surrounds were clean and the kids enjoyed playing and swimming.  There was a few waves, so keep an eye on the less strong swimmers.  A lot of beautiful hotels share this beach."
peterkrisjones,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,great beach that is clean and free from hawkers. protected reef allows for calm swimming. coral can be uncomfortable under foot but great to just sit in water and float.
travel_yoda_aus,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,"Came here for swimming as Kuta / Legian beaches in Dec / Jan are literally swimming with plastics and garbage. Nusa Dua was great! Clean waters. Two chairs and umbrella 100,000 and same prices you would find anywhere in Bali..."
GeordieGirl71,NorthEast,Jan 2017,"Melia Bali, Indonesia is well worth a visit! Beautiful beach, lovely hotel and friendly and attentive staff, from reception to waiting staff, they are all helpful and efficient "
Joanne J,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Without a doubt this is the cleanest, calmest, coolest beach in Nusa Dua.  They trek in new bags of pristine yellow sand every so often, and on an early beach walk you ll be meeting the guys that rake and clean the Bay every day. The currents are manageable and safe for most swimmers. There are only ""hotel approved"" hawkers, so you aren't in for a bun fight if you need to grab the odd new Sarong. In fact, they became friends of ours over a week's stay, beautiful and peaceful locals. It has back to back, immaculate beach dining too. Such a lovely place to spend the day."
susanlK5543WN,Darwin,Jan 2017,"We didn't pay for any water sports, just sat in the beautiful water and enjoyed the sun. We also did not purchase food but it was available for guests from our hotel ( private beach)."
Sarah D,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2017,"We did a tour of Bali's beaches, and this was by far the cleanest and nicest.  It didn't have any rubbish on it, or in the water that we could see.  It's in a private estate of 5 star resorts.  As opposed to Kuta, Sanur or Seminyak beaches it was clean, it looked nice and blue, and it made us want to swim.  It's got a little bay area, where it's great for kayaking and stand up paddle boarding."
Mary C,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"I'm not one for the beach however I have fallen in love with the beach at Nusa Dua.It's like swimming in a warm water bath, the sand is clean, the water is clear and the warm breeze just flows over your body.  Just Devine.You can hire a lounge under a tree or umbrella for around $5.  There are outdoor showers to freshen up and toilets.There are plenty of eateries around.   In our first visit to the beach we were on the side closer to the blow hole.  Where we ate at a place located on the beach.   On our second visit we were closer to the beach near Inaya resort.  I preferred this location. We had lunch at Inaya resorts Ja'Jan cafe, all I can say is wow, amazing.Didn't want to leave this place it's truely a little piece of paradise."
Senior Writer,"Vancouver Island, Canada",Dec 2016,Lovely white sand beach itch access from numerous hotels in Nusa Dua. Not a surfing beach as waves were small.
btwatkins,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"Take a stroll ,sunbake or a swim...fresh ..relaxing Devine way to spend a recharge ...gorgeous beaches"
harjeetb2017,"Dehradun, India",Dec 2016,Nice and beautiful beach with  five star hotels nearby. The restaurants at the hotels   gives you a good deal of choice. The water sports available include para-sailing and jet skiing as well as snorkelling and good for swimming.
Gaurav B,11 contributions,Jan 2017,Best beach in Bali if you want really good sand and sun. Advisable to go by cab as we were staying in seminyak (45min drive). Had an amazing day at beach. Be careful of prices as this is a premium beach. Would advise shoppers to do shopping in Kuta and Seminyak (we brought stuff which was at 50% cost in other places)...
MiamiTravelBug,Miami,Jan 2017,"This is the 4th beach I visited in Bali.It is also the cleanest and calmest. Sand is nearly white and very soft. Staff members are constantly cleaning up any seawead that washes ashore.Although there are a few hustlers here, they are regulated and don't persist as heavily as they do at other beaches."
willy219,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"I visited Nusa Dua beach directly from my hotel (Inaya Putri Bali). The beach is amazingly clean and fully maintain, because I saw a man who always do clean up whenever the wave bring some trash to the beach, he will collect them and put to the proper place. My kids are really really love this beach..."
locsnfreckles,"England, UK",Jan 2017,"I spent my entire afternoon on the beach, which was so amazing for me. I didnt have to move for food or drinks; only to get in the water and relax."
Dawn N,Mauritius,Jan 2017,Great beach. Soft waves. Lots of small be cases to choose from. Vendors available and lots of hotel restaurants to have coffee and chill. Quiet and peaceful. Plenty of water sports available. 
Larrabarb,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2016,Excellent area to compare with the frenetic Kuta Legian area.  Calm and beautiful where you do not need to go far.
t2lae,"Richmond, Australia",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dui beach is not bad, it's swim able with clear enough water. White sand but the tide was very low at the time I went. Not much waves, more like a swimming beach than surfing. Lots of Russian tourists sun tanning on the beach. There's better beaches in Bali. Average but not great, cleaner than seminyak beach. "
Swati C,3 contributions,Dec 2016,"This beach is just behind the Ayodya resort where we stayed, had access to it 24 hours. Nice clean and clear water. "
Loves2TravelALOT_11,"Huntington Beach, CA",Jan 2017,This beach is peaceful and exotic. The sand is fine and feels so goo on bare feet. The Indian Ocean water is warm and relaxing. A perfect place to spend the day.
Carol P,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Dec 2016,"Nusa Dua is a lovely beach which is surrounded by five star hotels.  The restaurants at the hotels are available for all to eat at, which gives you a good deal of choice.  The water sports available include para sailing and jet skiing as well as snorkelling.  We also got on the glass bottom boat which allows you to see in the water.The areas are quite separate so no issues with swimming.  Most of the hotels offer massage and spa but on the beach there are many locals that offer massages for a fraction of the price.  It depends on what you are looking for.  My husband and son went to the Sofitel for theirs.  They only take local currency but there is a money changer in the hotel."
RajaSmoothie81,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,"This resort has it all...manicured gardens, yoga, spa treatments, 4 pools, beach, restaurants, child-friendly and other physical activities. The staff are friendly and helpful and I had a very relaxing holiday."
debgods,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"While staying at Nusa Dua we walked the beach every morning & found it to be clean & free from rubbish, unlike Jimbaran beach."
Chris H,"Munich, Germany",Jan 2017,"We stayed in Courtyard which offers a free shuttle to their ""private"" beach or you can walk there in 15 minutes. Lots of hotels have their private section where you have chairs, drinks etc and the sales people don't approach you. With small kids it is nice as the water is very shallow.The beach itself is public but obviously the hotels do a good job cleaning it up from trash. The opposite you'll find on the northern side where there is a mix of erosion from the water and also lots of trash that noone feels responsible for. Though in the water on both sides you will swim with a lot of plastic particles! Quite sad also to see that a lot of locals throw their cigarettes at the beach or in the waters or have Picknick and don't bother to clean up after. Nusa Dua is supposed to be one of the nicer beaches on Bali but if you want to go for a beach vacation find a cleaner beach somewhere else."
saltis,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jan 2017,"Nice to walk on and nice to swim in morning when sea is less wild, water in january was very warm and not so clear"
Raps95,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,"Great surf and very family friendly beaches. Hire a surfboard or SUP, or grab a bike for a ride around the hotels."
Elizabeth B,9 contributions,Jan 2017,"this place so amazing, quiet atmosphere with white sand make my heart peacefully fallin love with this beach. sitting down, relax and get meditation then i've got a great day."
raghav_kapur5,"Dehradun, India",Jan 2017,"The beach is beautiful, clean and well maintained. It has been kept clean and green and serves as a reminder of the beauty of this beautiful country. "
Philip C,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2017,"These are amongst some of the best beaches in Bali, great surf and surrounded by luxurious 5 star hotels. A must visit on a trip to Bali "
Hanan H,"San Ignacio, Belize",Jan 2017,By far the best beach in Bali we have seen. If you are here it's worth checking out and once you do you won't leave you will keep coming back. Even if you are staying in another hotel make sure to come here. Blue water white sand everything you need. Great food and drinks you can pay to sit at one of the hotels umbrellas if you order food and drinks and spend the day there. We checked out a few beaches and this was by far the best. Also if you fancy a surf lesson you can do it here. 
Nicole M,"Jarrahdale, Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2017,"Gorgeous, clean beach beautiful blue water, was lovely to swim in much nicer than in Kuta / Legian area."
escapebo,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"It was calm conditions when we were there and also clean,we saw lots of beaches in Bali, extremely dirty, unpleasant . This is well protected."
Masud_Odvut_Dunia,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Sep 2016,Beaches are with different view in different part of Bali and this one is an excellent one. This is a bit quiet one. You can enjoy sun bath or just see the low tides here...its a place of scenic beauty.
Eizel7777,"Tavaksay, Uzbekistan",Jan 2017,"Premium place in Bali! Expensive over 2-3 times then Kuta, but for premium you have to pay. Security level is high."
Liambo,"Belfast, UK",Jan 2017,We found the beach to be grand if a little 'untidy'.  It is a shared beach with other hotels and could probably do with litter picker every day. 
moju72,Delhi,Dec 2016,Beautiful beach that is cleaned every morning. Safe. We weren't bothered by hawkers either. This beach fronts several 5 star resorts.
Tonyrandall3,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,"This beach is nice and quiet, clean and very nice to just lay around on for hours and hours. Its great for kids, and its quiet safe. There is not a lot of waves so its a great place that you can just wade around in for hours.When you are looking for lunch or something to drink, you can just walk up the beach and there is a variety of options for you and your family to choose from."
Shane71WA,perth,Jan 2017,Nice clean extreamly tidy beach that was quiet.Not many people on the beach no matter what time of the day or night we went
55scott,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"Hi a Guys, were staying at the Bali Hyatt, which is on the beach, nice beach gutter to swim in, the sandbar / reef effect puts the surf about 60 mts out, so if swimming isn't your strong point or the kids want to paddle this may be for you. There's a surf school outside the Hyatt grounds, so get the kids lessons, you won't regret it,  So do yourself a favour, get out of the banana lounge walk to Nusa Dua beach, put on the budgie smugglers and have a dip.  Regards Scott Land of Oz üòÅüòé"
0jaya,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"Great place to surf. Warm water. Lots of great places to eat along the beach!!!! Had a great stay!!!Sincerely, Jaya"
POLARBEAR81,"Kerobokan Kelod, Indonesia",Jan 2017,"relaxing beach, not so crowded and very nice view with clear water. There are hecklers on the beach but not as bad as thailand..."
easterntreker,"Halifax, Canada",Feb 2016,This is a lovely beach and a really peaceful place not too crowded. The beach is wide and water was warm . Really clean and a safe haven for sure.
Yohan Thilakaratne,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Jan 2017,The beach is very clean and well maintained along the Grand Hyatt area... ideal for jogging and walking in the morning. The people are nice and friendly.
tinapanayi2016,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2017,Another lovely beach however if you are not in a hotel on the beach there is very little non-hotel guest facilities such as deck chairs etc. area typically used by hotel guests  only.Non-hotel residents only have a very small area to make use of or sit on the sand where there is no shade. 
medvtan,"Manila, Philippines",Jan 2017,"If you have done your research then you would know that this part of Bali was developed for the tourists. I feel safe in this area. There is no traffic. It offers a quiet escape from reality. It is only 25 minutes away from the airport. The beach itself is clean, the whole area is clean! I love the feeling of walking along the beach then going to the mall by foot with sand on your feet. The mall itself is different from the usual mall. It has an open air vibe. "
Jaros≈Çaw M,75 contributions,Jun 2016,"A lovely beach, not crowded and very clean which is EXTREMELY important to us.Simply beautiful, but definitely not the best beach we have ever been as it is hampered slightly by the use of noisy jet skis."
Giovanni G,"Florianopolis, SC",Jan 2017,"It depends what you are used to (we travel full time), and while one of the best beaches in the area, it's still an average beach at best compared to many other places. The good news is that it's clean in front of the resorts, many of them are great quality resorts. Snorkelling is not really worth it, but there are plenty of opportunities to go diving, 45-60 boat rides bring you to some great spots.Lots of people on the beach selling water sport activities, diving, boat trips etc. Avoid booking with them.All in all, ok-good beach to Bali's standards. "
Oh Huds,Singapore,Jan 2017,It's a beautiful place to visit especially with family and friends. It's really a relaxing place for panic and sea activity. Chill by the beach. It's lovely. 
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Very clean long stretch of beach with numerous luxury hotels built along it...water sports are nearby...
natnoodle11,"Norfolk, VA",Jan 2017,"It was perfect for my son to play in the beach as well. The waters were calmer toward the beach, there was plenty of space and beach options all around. We also had lunch at a very nice local place close to the beach. We walked around at the shops afterward and had a nice Starbucks drink as well. It was a really great beach option in the southern Bali area, and you can also see the Water Blow area by there. There is a nice, large park with a monument right by the beach as well."

Kris B,"Canet-en-Roussillon, France",Jan 2017,"Great place, great people, perfect relax. We were on two day tours and diving trip. There is plenty of massage places, very tasty food and lots of sun!"
Reisende_Sun,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2016,"The beach is clean and well maintained, but there are a number of locals in blue shirts with numbers on their backs who walk around trying to sell you everything from a ride on a boat to cheaply made dresses. I understand that is how they make a living, but I just want to enjoy the beach, not have to tell someone every 5 mins that I do not want a ride a banana float."
Kitkat071,"Canning Vale, Australia",Dec 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is clean and feels lovely on your feet nothing like the kuta beaches where the beach is bulldozed every day to clean the rubbish that washes up from Java.  nice to see the sunrise from in the morning.  
surasen2012,43 contributions,Dec 2016,Was not impressed with the beach....alot of coral and rocks...stayed at club med and only explored that stretch of beach....
jacquelinemdunn,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,"Found the beach to be clean, was unable to swim as it was rough and strong current. Life guard on duty. good to lay down and relax by. "
IslanderWC,"Sedgefield, South Africa",Jan 2017,"Nusa Dua beach is great any time of the day. We have been there at sunrise, sunset and in between. Safe for swimming and plenty of activities if you are into that sort of thing "
Adrian L,"Munich, Germany",Jan 2017,"Almost white sand, clean water and clean beach (even at rainy season / Dez. 2016).Difficult to find, but when you are down the stairs, it's awesome! "
tracey k,"Legana, Australia",Dec 2016,"We love Nusa Dua because there aren't such crowds as at Kuta Beach.  If you're after surf waves you won't like Nusa Dua, but if you want to enjoy the water and maybe a little water sports then Nusa Dua is the place for you and your family.  Some parts of the beach are very well maintained while other parts are a little dirty.  I think it depends on the hotels which have beachfront access."
imadedwijananda,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"i reallly enjoyed to walk through this beach line. people so friendly and fantastic. i love Bali so much, "
Leslie D,"China Spring, TX",Dec 2016,Beautiful beach. Very few vendors- but the ones there are have good stuff. Get a Bali massage on the beach in a private tent! Trust me in this!
Nick T,"Salmiya, Kuwait",Jan 2017,"The beach is really nice and sandy. The waves break on the reef just off shore and its gets really shallow as the tide goes out. The coral is sharp so watch your feet! There are plenty of water sports however, with the exception of surfing you will be taken to another beach if you want to do water sports. The public beach has life guards on duty so if you are in sight of them you will be looked after should you get into trouble. Massages are available as well as cheap cafes or more expensive hotels."
Colomba S,13 contributions,Dec 2016,The beach looked great but I couldn't see any life savers on duty. Especially when the sand in the beach in the water is like quicksand and if your not a strong swimmer you would be in trouble. There should be signs with warnings and lifeguards on patrol 24/7. It's an accident waiting to happen. I suggest you swim in the resort pool its much safer. 
Trent890,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,The beach is not crowded at all and very clean. Great for some nice pictures. Does not have big waves which you get in other beaches such as Kuta or Pandawa. 
Stefan S,"Shenzhen, China",Dec 2016,"We went to Nusa Dua Gerber Beach.  This is close to St Regis Hotel (if you have a car put St Regis in your GPS, then just pass the hotel and turn left).The beach is really clean.  You pay a small 3.000 Rp p.p. entrance fee, then u can enjoy a nice afternoon or day in the clean water and white sand.Relax is the name of the game!"
Charlette Bree,"Wollongong, Australia",Dec 2016,"Nusa Dua beach was much better than I expected. We had been to Bali a few times before but had always stayed in the Kuta area, so Nusa Dua was a nice change.The beach is very large, clean, safe, and convenient for us as we were staying at the Grand Hyatt. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area."
Divyendu,"Navi Mumbai, India",Oct 2016,"I liked the Nusa Dua Beach. During my stay in WestIn,i regularly jog  in the morning. Yes, they also had jogging track along the beach.Nice."
Ts S,399 contributions,Dec 2016,"It's worth the one hour trip from Legian. Clean water with warm temperature. Nice area with bars and local food.great surf area,you can take surf classes or rent a surf board for the day."
yesduhh,"Cochabamba, Bolivia",Dec 2016,"Recommended if you have no place better for the beach.  Came here  after disappointing experiences in "" Dreamland "" beach as well as Padang Padang Beach, where there was too much garbage or too many obnoxious people.As far as I know, this might be the only beach in Bali that is not covered in litter.  It ranks up there with average beaches in Thailand.  Only one public vehicle access so unless you are staying at one of the expensive resorts, you must rent a chair at the one smallish area near the public parking, but really not to bad.  Average food fare and beer prices.  Loungers with umbrella, 50K.  Trasnport Cost from the airport (Kuta) area:  we paid a driver 50K for 5 hours at the beach.   Tell driver to take the toll road, and arrive before 11 in good weather to if you want a lounger."
Billie F,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Dec 2016,I love the Nusa dua beach. The white sands are incredible. Not too crowded in the beach and so we could relax much better
Igor S,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2016,"This is the beach for people looking for a quiet and relaxing spot to enjoy sea, clean sand and some snorkeling. Very clean and safe, unlike some of the beaches in much busier nearby Semenyak."
Aisha W,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,This beach offers a variety of water sports and an opportunity to sun bathe or relax. It was part of our hotel in Nusa Dua so we had access to the spa as well. There are drinks and restaurants for food. Entry into the waters can be a bit rough due to shells and pieces of stone. However once in its perfect. There are women selling sarongs and dresses and they are reluctant to accept NO as an answer which leads to them becoming tiresome. Enjoyed this beach very much. 
fly fly away fly,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2016,Bali is just abeautiful place u just have to visit it the people are amazing the sea is so calm and nice nusa dua is abeautiful area amazing 
Bo Q,"Shanghai, China",Jan 2016,The beach is not top level comparing to the onces in Thai or Phil. the sand is not very soft you can feel small stones and dead coral shells. I don't know why but the wave is very small beside the beach. it's a great place for family with kids
JIMMY C,9 contributions,Dec 2016,"Bali. A land of gods & beauty. About 90% of the locals there are Hindu and the places there are surprisingly cleaner than some other south east Asia countries we have been to. Tourist attractions are in Ulu Watu, Jimbaran, Ubud and shopping belts are mostly centred around Seminyak & Kuta. We travelled in mid December and weather  is hot & humid without rain.With 3D4N, we covered almost all areas in south Bali except Legian."
NowAngeloti,"Genoa, Italy",Nov 2016,"I was in some beaches in Bali but I think this one is the nicest and calmest to swim ,was staying  a bit far (about 16 km+) but almost every day I was coming here!!!!!"
Anil12TRIP,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2016,Nice private beach great location. You can swim and it's perfect location for a family outing. Close to the hotel restaurant. 
jean1louw,"Beijing, China",Dec 2016,Nusa Dua beaches was clean and mostly protected from the December weather conditions.Nice for swimming and can also accommodate surfers.
bmayet,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2016,Lovely beach. Great for romantic strolls and spending the evening under the stars. The waves are not great for snorkellibg or diving but great for young families anf couple.
Boyd J,"Maleny, Australia",Dec 2016,There is a small public beach area and many luxury resorts have sections set aside for guests to relax on the beach.  It is regularly cleaned and consequently is largely litter free and the sand is soft.
Michael A,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,Has the advantage of reef then a drop off and all that brings and less plastic than the rest so better than all the beaches in the south.Authorities need to do much much more about plastic and other filth in the water than they do.We will not be returning until we hear there has been change as water sports are important to us.
Humbirdi,"Caloundra, Australia",Dec 2016,"The beach is lovely and the water is clean and clear. The walk along either end of the beach is good for a work out as the sand is soft and like quicksand closer to the water. Really loved walking along looking at the shells and saying hello to the fishermen.  If it is really hard going you can also go along the footpath that runs from one end of the beach to the other.  At the blowhole end there are markets.  Its great to walk along and check out each hotel and then stop for lunch or dinner.  You can get to the Bali Connection shops through the Hyatt, which may not be allowed but we snuck through!  I don't know what the beach is like during high season but we found it great and not crowded. Lovely at night too."
Marioncoburn,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Dec 2016,Beautiful beach with white sand and very safe. Lots of surfers out with lots of learners as well. Nowhere near as busy as Kuta which makes it so much better.if you are not staying in Nusa Dua take a day trip out here. The Grand Bali have a private beach club at the blow hole end of the beach and you can pay for a lounger to use with umbrella. They also have a bar and food available. 
Samuel D,"Solo, Indonesia",Dec 2016,This place is one of our favorite beach to be visited For it is clean and white sand.Children are enjoyed playing by the beach.In the evening the wind is a bit strong so you can have quite a big wave .Overall it is really a nice place 
Shan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,Very clean beach compared to Kuta lots of expensive 5 stars hotel situated here. But the cleanliness of the beach was really pleasing and less crowded compared to the others:)
roberthklein,"Kamala, Thailand",Dec 2016,Stunning little place on earth - lovely paradise. Had a great time on Nusa Dua beach and really like my time there!
Yogananthan D,"Bangalore District, India",Dec 2016,"Great time at the beach, clean and not very crowded. The water is very clear. A great beach for family."
Annette L,"Daytona Beach, FL",Dec 2016,Great beach lots to see but really more for relaxing in Bali check out resorts to see artwork and fine dining all resorts have something good to offer 
Shazonthego,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"Better than beaches in Seminyak, Legian or Kuta for cleanliness but nothing compared to endless white pristine beaches on the coast of Western Australia.  We are very spoilt there. "
ali1610,34 contributions,Dec 2016,"Great , clean , beautiful , with all you need there .Enjoy with sun but don't forget sun protection .If you love beaches you reach your order .Some of water sport there .If some beach vendors come to you buy from them ( after some negotiation ) trust me you get a good price than shops ."

Gvv V,53 contributions,Sep 2016,"This space is very nice ,water and area is clean ..to many people's but ok is normal ..if you visit Bali visit this area"
Abheesh E,Mauritius,Dec 2016,"We found the Nusa Dua region when going to the Devdan Show and decided that we must come back to the quaint little town. Te town in itself is very scenic and very clean, almost too picture-perfect. The Nusa Dua beach is by far my favourite beach in Bali as it is very very very quiet and one can access a small temple which is hidden amidst the beach. The view from the small temple is spectacular. The beach is also very quiet unlike the other beaches in Bali (i.e. Kuta and Jimbaran) so it is a nice change  and its a great place to lazily lounge around and do nothing! For lunch, there is a small mall not far off the beach and there are a few local street food stalls near the beach. "
Sannyasin,38 contributions,Dec 2016,"Beautiful beach, soft sand and small waves.. Had a great time at the blow hole and looking at beautiful hotels, water park and restaurants"
Marjen183,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"We visited the stretch of beach reserved for Amarterra Resort guests and found the sand to be clean and the small waves manageable. We were offered various craft work by beach vendors but they didn't push the issue when we showed we weren't interested. There are plenty of restaurants along this stretch, so if you are peckish or thirsty you don't have far to go. Our only gripe was the rocks and loose coral in the shallows, but once you navigate over these, the swimming is fine."
Gsouan,"Santorini, Greece",Nov 2016,Nusa dua beach is very nice and clean beach!the water is not deep and its perfect if you like SUP!you must visit it if you go to Bali
Pavli,World,Dec 2016,"Nusa Dua is generally nice part of Bali (definitely nicer than Kuta) and its beach is beautiful, long, shallow and clean! We came across Nusa Dua by acciddent and didnt know where we were driving, we ended up at the entrance to Nusa Dua hotel resorts and as there was free entry we went in and park our motorcycle near hotel resort called Melia. We found an amazing beach!! Beach is really long and I would say that each part belongs to different resort. Our was with free entry but I am not aure about other resorts. We also had a lunch at Melia beach restaurant which was not only for its guests but also free to public. Food was good but quite expensive. Both beach and the resort looked very well looked after - spotless! There were lots of locals offering us a sun bed or water sports. I highly recommend Nusa Dua beaches to visit! "
HishamZarinaAnwar,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,"If you want a quite place and just relax by the beach, this is the place. Good for family and couple. Clean and nice view."
Jade O,"London, UK",Dec 2016,"First of all this is a very long beach! So don't be put off Incase you visit the wrong part. We visited the part near the St.Regis... absolutely stunning... clear water and clean sand.We actually stayed up at the Bali Tropic, where the stretch beach is nowhere near as nice...dark water and dirty looking. Be sure to visit the right part and you won't be disappointed!"
jenabaintheworld,"Washington DC, DC",Dec 2016,lovely white sandy beach with gentle surf.   long expanse of beach along  multiple hotels.    felt very safe to walk along.    lovely views.
Shaun S,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2016,"We enjoyed the beach as there are many places to relax. Good food and drinks everywhere, but I will say pick your places as the price for drinks change greatly. Never got hassled like Kuta, which makes a difference. Good to ride a bike along the beach. "
Adelia R,26 contributions,Dec 2016,We went here with motorbike and found shortcut next to Hilton Hotel. The road is still unfinished so you have to walk down some stairs but the view is totally breathtaking. I would recommend coming here in the early morning.
Keti G,7 contributions,Sep 2016,"The beaches are beautiful with white sand in a calm bay so perfect for swimming in the sea and for families. The hotels are generally international brands with a great choice of facilities, immaculate gardens and relaxed ambiance."
diwoll,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,Sadly the day we went it was horrible.  Water was full of rubbish and some sort of oil slick was floating on the top.  We were hounded by hawkers - we were promised we wouldn't be.  Really disappointing.
Tulkara,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,Our hotel is not on the beach but has a private beach area here. Advertised as beautiful and clean off we went. On arrival it looked great but as we ran to the water things changed. Floating all over the surface as far as you could see was garbage and some unknown sludge. We have been to a lot of beaches all over the world and this one is firmly placed at the bottom of the list. It was back to the pool fighting past the hawkers that were lining up with their bags of wares. Worst of the worst. 
Fifi_Mothei,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Oct 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean. All the hotels with beach clubs are doing a very good job maintaining it and providing good service at the bars. When the sun sets, tables and chairs will be set out along the beach for those who would like a candle lit dinner by the beach. Very romantic, a definite must do while in Bali. "
Uncle_Vin,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,not the white sand type and quite coarse actually so you need to wear something walking on the beach. not in  tourist season so the beach is empty! my private beach 
917jodi,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Nov 2016,Clean sand and blue water made this a nice stop. The water became deep very quickly and there was only one restaurant in the area but definitely worth a visit.
grandbalitour,13 contributions,May 2016,"Very fantastic nice view of this beach, A nice and clean beach where no one bothers you. Enjoy, relax and relax. This is a must go place and an experience in itself. In the free time, go to some of the selection "
PJC19642014,"Lisbon, Portugal",Dec 2016,"Surprisingly nearby Dempasar's airport and surrounded by VIP Resorts, with  ""restricted"" access to balinese , these beach is clean, calm with no sellers following you, diferent to all other beaches I've visited in Bali."
Mpressnix,"New York City, NY",Aug 2016,"Nusa Dua Beach is an exclusive and beautiful stretch of sand in Bali.  This beach has amazing sunrises.  If you are there during the full moon, it is quite an amazing site.  The water is perfect, even at night. The little pools that are created when the tide is low are exquisite pools of warmth from which you can see anemone and see horses. It is just a beautiful placeüëçüòÉ."
Kemoy C,40 contributions,Nov 2016,Warm waters.  Nice beach. I am a beach snob :) and from the Caribbean and have seen some gorgeous beaches. This was okay but nice. Clean beach. 
DrChandrakant,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2016,"A nice and clean beach where no one bothers you. Enjoy, relax and relax.  This is a must go place and an experience in itself.  In the free time, go to some of the select and high quality restaurants.  "
slwityk,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2016,Beautiful beach to stroll on especially in the morning or evening.  The beach goes for miles and with the pristine water to swim in is a must.
Pte_J0ker,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"A quite and reasonably nice beach, good if you want to just chill and take is the sun and a dip in the water or maybe try some beginners surfing or stand up paddle boarding."
SANJAYPATELDR,"Jamnagar, India",Nov 2016,"While the beach offers all sea activities , a special visit of  turtle island in a  glass bottom boat  is a must .Enjoy the beautiful corals on way , not only the turtles but so many birds and animals and quench your thirst  at the end with big big coconut water..."
Karen M,"Blantyre, UK",Nov 2016,"Without a doubt all the beaches in Bali are a gorgeous.Nusa Dua beach is stunning, water seems more calmer at the shore than Kuta. The beach is also very clean."
Tony,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Nusa Dua is ""the beach"" everyone tells you to visit in Bali, and yes it is nice but it is also covered in rubbish and has 100 hotels fronting onto it. Hey, that's Bali though."
Cristina_Dumitru,"Bucharest, Romania",Nov 2016,"Perfect for the ones staying in Nusa Dua beach resorts. Spectacular views, extremely hot water, plenty of corals and colorful fishes. Best for water sports."
SUBODHCAM,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,Best beach. Only for hotel guests. Superb view. Safe and hotel has provided bed on beach and chairs to relax
ClaudiaFDias,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2016,"Nice and calm. You have to try the massage at the Nusa Dua Beach. Very cheap if compared to hotel, and very good quality. Be nice with the sarong/clothes sales in the beach and they will be nice with you :)"
lluviagutierrez,"Avon, CO",Nov 2016,"its a nice beach very relaxing and quiet with nice resorts araound, it definitely needs some cleaning you find a lot of trash around. "
Katedrum,"Edmonton, Canada",Oct 2016,"It is sad to see how much garbage floats to this beach. Some hotels clean it up, some don't. I have heard this is also dependent on the season (tides). The scenery is beautiful though. It's worth going, but I suggest to be mindful and don't add to the pollution problem - respect our planet and put garbage where it belongs. "
Mustafa S,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Oct 2016,Good for a nice walk in the morning or evening. A good long stretch of sand. A lot better than Kuta beach. 
Nimish N,2 contributions,Nov 2016,"Beautiful Beaches, White Sand, Clear Water. Excited to see the Concerned Hotel staff keeps Beach clean, Plastic Free and Keep on Dressing the Sand..!"
LoveAtFirstSight13,"Washington Crossing, PA",Nov 2016,"I didn't like this beach at all. It was dirty, trash-filled and tons of water sports polluting the water and the air. Too loud too."
C555J,"Cape Town, South Africa",Nov 2016,"Into the 5th day of our stay...our resort is just footsteps away from this little bit of heaven.  Clean, white beautiful Nusa Dua beach...and what a pleasure to be able to say that you needn't worry about being interrupted by hawkers who are trying to fob their merchandise off on you! Perfectly clean...surrounding restaurants along the beach front offers a good variety of food at reasonable prices...highly recommend...& will definitely back in the near future!"
agusw281,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Feels so sad to learn that the beach not as sapcious as before when I live in Nusa Dua in 2000's. Peaople were often play soccer,  volley ball and  practicing jugling around the beach and grass area. Now those spacious ground are having a massive abrassion and I Think immediate action should be done to avoid bigger impact in the future."
matyabun,"Vilnius, Lithuania",Oct 2016,But still the Nusa Dua beach is not bad at all. Cleanness of water depends on oceans stream and daytime. Best time for swimming is early in the morning. Plenty of cafes and massage options on the beach.
ReshuTomar,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2016,"It is a very nice and clean and less people beach, mostly for the tourists from 5 star hotels which are abundant on the Nusa Dua beach. There are a lot of mangrove trees on the beach which caught my attention. I loved the park near the beach which has a huge Arjun and Krishna statue (i guess). We also spotted a very young komodo species there. A little market nearby, few shacks for drinks and shops for food. If you are not the guest of the hotels that are located on this beach then please be informed that you will not get a bed on the beach as they all belong to the hotels. But you can always sit on the chairs that belong to the shacks.Do explore the area near Nusa Dua beach, the theater, shopping mall and the beautifully kept roads."
BMDEE,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2016,This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Bali. We only got to see it once - next time visit I think I will stay over this way. 
Penelope H,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Nov 2016,Wonderful sunrise setting in Bali for an early morning walk if you are staying in the middle of Nusa Dua 
LifeTravel96,"Puchong, Malaysia",Oct 2016,It's a nice beach and less congested. Clean and very nice for taking pics. It's a great experience to have dinner by this beach at night.
katie,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,"Visited here three years ago and there were still some areas for outsider i.e. People who don't stay in the luxury hotels within Nusa Dua. However when we went back this time, the entire beach is occupied by the hotel groups where you could only rent their beach chairs. Apart from renting the beach chairs, the ocean is nice and blue with clear water. "
Dedy I Santoso I,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,This beach is a private beach for BTDC members' or hotel's guest only. But mostly people who know this place will come directly and relaxing on the beach.Very excellent view and we enjoy day-time on the beach.But only 1 restroom for washing our body afther playing sand. Need more restroom.
Alexander R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,We stayed few times around nusa dua resort that have private acces to nusa dua beach and every time we came the beach were always clean.Recommended for those who wants a quite time and not crowded
Timmy T,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2016,The whole Nusa Dua beach area are basically controlled by the hotels/resorts and you are not allowed to even enjoy the sunshine while your own blanket. You will have to rent a beach chair from them which are of coz rather expensive.Anyways the blue ocean is worth the visit.
Rena G,"Nanjing, China",Sep 2016,"Very pretty - white sand, great ocean viewNice beach umbrellas for rent. Price wasn't too bad.Not that crowded compared to other popular beachesThere is a big shallow area with clear water and small fishiesNext to the beach was a park ish area where you can walk to a cliff - breath taking views there."
Denise Perkins,"Lismore, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach is reasonably pretty enough, but after coming from the east coast of Australia, we realised that we actually have nicer beaches close to home. They rake debris off the beach each morning. There are hawkers trying to sell you things and the footpath has been partly smashed away by (storms? sand erosion?)"
davieMar,"Tickton, UK",Oct 2016,A stunning beach. The tide lines are kept clean of seaweed by staff from the nearby hotels. There are very few people on the beach. Its a very long beach with shallow sandy sections and deeper areas but *Beware!* we found that there can be strong rip currents depending on the tides and wind direction. The tide times are posted on a boards belonging to hotels.
unnatural2u,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2016,Less people and a lot cleaner. Pay a visit to the water blow point (best time at noon or early morning).
Lloyd R,"Victoria, Canada",Oct 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is really nice. Not too many people but a great walkway along the Hotel row. The tide comes in and out a long way. I enjoy this area . It's very green and tropical. Give it a try
uwiee2512,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Away from crowded Kuta until Seminyak, we can happily spend good times in Nusa Dua beach. We really enjoy the beach"
Whizkid j,4 contributions,Nov 2016,"Not exceptional. But good for casual visitor. Lot of free chairs on the beach. Cleanliness 7/10. Always use UBER/Grab for transport. If you use the local transport in the area, they will rip you off 5X the uber rates. "
Sanjayshah912,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is lovely. Very clean, very inviting.Not very crowded. It is great for spending some leisurely time.Worth a visit."

mfarrags,Egypt,Nov 2016,1. The atmosphere was really good2. The water was full of rocks3. Good place to go4. Really enjoyed going there even more than kuta beach 
Lash0106,"Australind, Australia",Nov 2016,Stunning beaches-   clean and not too busy. Safe to swim in and very little beach selling. Much nicer than Kuta and Legian area beaches. 
sashena h,"Chicago, IL",Nov 2016,Absolutely great beach!! Clean water and sand!!! Was very pleasantly surprised at the beach quality - will definitely go back !! 
Rach C,4 contributions,Nov 2016,"This beach is really nice, very private. There are a few locals around asking if you would like a massage, to be honest they scared my children as they were in the bushes and just randomly spoke up. The waves are pretty strong, but very clean bridge. "
Karen P,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2016,"Having stayed in Bali previously I was impressed by beach at Nusa Dua, clean and beautiful.  Most hotels have security so not many touts. Easy access and good waves at times."
yogis26,pune,Nov 2016,this beach is quite clean compared to other beaches of Bali. The slope of beach is quite high making it dangerous for small kids but for adults it is great for swimming.
John M,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2016,"The hotels strictly control the touts and the cleanliness in front of their properties., otherwise the rubbish is noticeable. There are no lifeguards as such and you are advised to have footwear when swimming due to things that sting. The area is secure with a strong police presence."
FaddySue,"Kuching, Malaysia",Jan 2016,"We stopped at Nusa Dua beach on the first day of our Bali holiday for a bit of beach activity and water sport activity.Our tour bus took us to the end of Nusa Dua beach where there were many operators offering activities like scuba diving, jet skies, banana boat rides, underwater walking, water power jet etc. If you're looking for any type of water activity and sport, you'll find it here. Charges are pricey but what do expect when you go to such a tourist destination. Facilities; like changing room, toilet, lockers etc., are available but not exactly the best. A word of caution, keep your valuables e.g. cameras and hand phones locked in your tour bus, it's safer.We found the beach very crowded as literally all tourists come here just about to enjoy some water sports. We felt it wasn't safe as you get speedboats criss crossing among the banana boat rides and the jet skiers. Not sure if the operators have a safety guide when operating the various rides. Due to the excessive crowds, the beach is not that clean as a result. But you're looking for a bit of beach fun in Bali, then this the place to go. "
Ratna K,1 contribution,Sep 2016,"this place is beautiful with clean beach and Sunday market in the and of the month, also many restaurant."
zipconiac,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"It has everything that called pleasure. White sand beach with no trash. Low med waves so it make ur 5 yrs old children can play with.You can pamper urself with hand massage. 100k rp for 30 minutes, or maybe it need extra cash if you foreigner. I dont know why this discrimination exist, maybe foreigner have bigger body :)"
AussieKandA,Western Australia,Oct 2016,Beach had a fair amount of plastic garbage on the high water mark. The rest of the beach was clean and well maintained.
Ana T,"Muscat, Oman",Dec 2015,"Clean and crystal clear water, a perfect place for water sports such as jet skiing. Perfect for kids as well :)"
jigneshad,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2016,One of the cleanest beach in Indonesia. Lot of water sports activities keeps you busy throughout the day.
neelmap,"Panjim, India",Nov 2015,"Serene, peaceful, calm would be the only words to describe Nusa Dua beach in bali. Lovely watersports. had a great time."
ClaireBeeNYC,"New York City, NY",Oct 2016,"Very pretty, clean beach. Many people are here so it could be crowded. But I would def say it's top 10 in Bali."
sundara,Bombay,Oct 2016,"The sea is clean and inviting, not more than waist deep till about 10  metres from the shore, very mild waves making it a nice place to swim"
paddy13191,"Gold Coast Hinterland, Australia",Oct 2016,We stayed at Nusa Dua for 7 nights and were on the beach everyday. It is a very good beach but could be cleaner. The resorts have beach cleaners there everyday but they never were able to keep up with it. We went swimming everyday and there was always some rubbish in the water or on the beach. 
Kellyann1075,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"The Nusa Dua beach is a gorgeous white sand beach with plenty of water sports. It is safe for children to swim however there are a few hawkers around (not unusual for Bali). Lots and lots of weddings when we were there, seemed a little bit like a 'one size fits all' approach to weddings with couple after couple trekking down the pier for photos. That said, it was entertaining to sit and watch after recently getting married at the unique and quiet Komune resort. Loved the beach however and would defiantly recommend a visit."
Andrew B,Darlinghurst,Oct 2016,Quiet peaceful hot but gentle breeze service if you just lift your head. A perfect place to do nothing but just relax and get a great tan just hop skip and jump from any of the fabulous resorts that touch this amazing beach. The ocean is calm protected by a reef perfect for water sports and swimming üòéüòéüòé
Lucykeebs,"Essex, UK",Aug 2016,"Absolutely gorgeous, I felt like I was in paradise! However it is also the most expensive place I visited, a bottle of water cost ¬£4 and in Bali that is an extortionate price, even in England it would be! "
taryn81,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,This was our first Nusa Dua experience and we were pleasantly surprised. The pathway along the beach that winds around all the beautiful restaurants and resorts was perfect for us. We also loved the quiet nature of nusa dua. There is not many people really hassling you to buy things and the ones that are there along the beach have a lovely manner. There is also a big security presence which adds to the feeling of safeness.The actual Nusa Dua beach water is a disappointment as it is quite dirty but everything else makes up for itüòÑ
Tamsin v,"Durban, South Africa",Oct 2016,"Amazing! We stayed at Club Med and spent plenty time on the beach! Snorkelling, windsurfing, jetskiing and parasailing. Great walk along the beach past all the hotels."
medewiforever,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"The Mercure Bali Nusa Dua, transport you  to the beach. They have a section under the trees just for guests of the Hotel. Its a lovely area. The water is beautiful. It is a very pleasant area to visit. "
LeanneJ721,"Hobart, Australia",Oct 2016,The beach is used for entry to water sports and where I was all the accommodation was right on the beach but the beach itself was very covered in seaweed and not very clean looking. Hotels had pools.
LilysMum0723,"Clinton, WA",Sep 2016,"Loved this experience, sands are beautiful lovely beach and water is so warm.  Paradise and more, nothing short of amazing"
pjworldtravel,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2016,"Secluded, peaceful, calm would be the words to describe nusa dua beach. Having said that, its not really that secluded, there are lot of tourists, but a different group of crowd. This part is slightly upscale side. No much hawkers or groups of guys etc. And it is pretty safe too. There is lot of nice sand shore. Its better to stay in resorts around nusa dua if someone wants to really enjoy. There are water sports activities too. Waves are not that strong because of corals. Its safe to get into water and play even with small kids. For swimming one need to check the tides and water level. Need to know which parts have corals to avoid swimming those areas.Overall this is a beach to relax. For partying you need to go to other areas like kuta and seminyak."
Christine Paterson,"Scotland, UK",Oct 2016,Lovely clean beach. Some of the hotels should take more pride in there part of the beach thou. Our hotel had it cleaned every day at Inaya Putri. 
tanasha_farhan,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2016,Wow must see clean neat and more relaxing after long some tiring day you can sit at the beach relax and and enjoy
Imraan_000,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Oct 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is the best beach in Bali.Clean and private. Be aware of which hotel you book as some strips are better than others.
Mark W,"Basildon, UK",Oct 2016,"First place wanted about 2 million to do both git them down to one then failed the medical they don't like diabetes type 2 for some reason anyhoe went down the road paid 1.2 million and went straight to induction lol no medical so you can slash prices massively if you ask !! Sea walker is ok but the pressure build up does get to you when you go down further it's not deep but it's uncomfortable but good, snorkelling is snorkelling the people are all nice and chilled just don't pay the price on the sheet !!!!!! Sorry it's a pic of me only had two lol but that's the wet suit you get "
637juneg,"Tumbi Umbi, Australia",Oct 2016,"The beach was lovely with white sand and shade from trees, great place to read your book until being interrupted by people selling things. Hard to communicate that I only had my towel glasses and book with me,  no money. I had to promise to come back tomorrow for them to leave. There was also quiet a bit of rubbish on waters edge, plastic bottles and wrappers that had been washed up. I didn't actually swim there."
Nouzab,"Viti Levu, Fiji",Oct 2016,A great beach to hang out but the not the best for swimming. Lot of food outlets as well as bars. Very important for o do morning as well as after sunset walks.
Loum613,Connecticut,Oct 2016,"The beach is fronted in some areas by a reef which keeps wave activity controlled. Be sure to visit the ""water blow"". Some of the walkway areas in the more public area where washed away by the last Cyclone, but still ok to walk. Also an easy beack walk to The Collection shops, with nice restaurants and shopping."
NinaKrohn,"Taipei, Taiwan",Oct 2016,We spent almost a week at this beach and we loved every minute of it! We are looking forward to coming back next year!
sirmapetrova,"Varna, Bulgaria",Apr 2016,The beach is really beautiful. I love to walk around. It is really romantic. There are women who sells different interesting things. You can enjoy a four hands massage there. It is awesome.
Travel Bug,"Canton of Zurich, Switzerland",Oct 2016,"Ok Beach but some trash in water and on the beach like plastic bags, wrappers etc. It is fun to walk out on to the little peninsula with temple on it."
A forever explorer,"Samford, Australia",Oct 2016,We love Nusa Dua and choose to stay here as its lots quieter and pretty and clean. The front of beach all the resorts link up and its just beautiful to walk along. You feel very very safe and no one hassles you on the beach as its all private. However particularly towards the benoa end its  ery average beach.flat calm but shallow and at low tide turns into long sand flats. Towards the hilton the beach is much better. To catch cab to kuta is about 10 dollars to 15 dollars.
196A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"Located near to Nusa Dua hotel complex, this is a quiet and beautiful beach compared to Kuta. Not like other beach with high waves, this beach is great for family with kids."
shah,Wales,Oct 2016,"We atayed at the Hyatt, beach was nice quiet and clean ,sea looked clean and was nice and warm. It stretches across a few resorts "
DarreninHK,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2016,"Backed by luxury hotels, this is a great beach, with penty of places to eat and drink, or to have fun. However, as all the hotels are expensive, expect everyting to be pricy."
Thomas O,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2016,Very clean & Clear water beach with not so huge tide..Very well maintained. Some companies like Thirtha Harum operate water sports.    
Carey,"Taunton, UK",Oct 2016,"Beach was kept clean by the beach cleaners, though they buried the rubbish, rather than taking it away, at high tide it's a lovely beach, and low tide though slightly disappointing"
TrishAdrian,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,The beach in front of the Westin resort was a beach not to forget We loved alternating between our pool and the beach! It was always clean and a real treat to swim in but also enjoy the walk along side it.We loved sipping cocktails at any one of the resorts whilst sitting on the beach!Some nights at the Westin resort they had a dj playing very cool chilled out music which really set the mood. 
Mankj65,19 contributions,Dec 2015,White sand beach with clear water. Good for jogging track. the wave is not so big and perfect for swiming on the beach. On sunday afternoon Will more crowded with local people. But nice can see how to know the balinese people activity.
markbeck89,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2016,"It is beautiful and clean. Everybody can spend a beautiful time here. Although I didn't try any water sport, but I could see how the people were satisfied with those amazing experience. "
Elisa_unterwegs,"Moneglia, Italy",Oct 2016,Nice beach but in my opinion not the best of Bukit. Honestly i prefer the beaches in the area of ulu watu.
Yurong,Singapore,Oct 2016,clean and nice beach in front of luxury hotels. minimal spending is more compared to other beaches but less tourists along the same stretch so it's more quiet. 
tousax737,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach was amazing. The sand was white, the water was clear and it wasn't crowded. Hardly any hawkers trying to sell us things and it really made a difference. More amenities could be good such as public toilets etc, but other than that I cant fault this beach. amazing"
Ian M,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2016,"We visited during the 'shoulder' season for tourists, expecting very little activity. But, we were very wrong. Lots of action with glass bottom boats, paragliding, banana boats and much more. There was still space to relax on the beach as well."
Sunny M,Sweden,Oct 2016,we have been there just a day trip was really nice and clean beach and good for water sports the people like water sports will like that place a lot of restaurant and hotels there good view and so clear water 
Stephanie Smailes,26 contributions,Oct 2016,"Beautiful beach! Suitable for swimming. Great massage place between Lagoona and Inaya Putri - 200,000 rupiahs for 1 hour and 2 masseuses!"
Sanath Kumar,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2016,"The best beach in south Bali.. Has water sport activities and also secret coves, where one can spend time with loved ones.. Very clear water and shallow for the kids as well. Could get dirty at times when the waves wash up the weeds.. "
Em P,"Prague, Czech Republic",Oct 2016,"At low tide this beach is full of rubbish, water stale and not super clean. I can imagine, though, that on high tide it is a gem. Beautiful, long, sandy, with pretty little peninsulas on each corner. We went to the stripe called Melia or Pirates bay and in between that and pantai Samuh there is a magical little peninsula. Explore it a bit for beautiful cliffs from other side, if you swim around on the sea level, there is gorgeous tiny hidden beach, also lot of corals for snorkelling. The beach surroundings are only being in construction (like concrete path I mean), so there is no fee (might be in future when they make it better). Restaurants not the cheapest, if you travel on budget, bring your own snack and drink.It was not very crowded, more locals than tourists, and there were few spots where to find shade which is always great bonus ;)"
Rouge_fairy,"Makati, Philippines",Oct 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is quiet and picturesque but that's all. Lots of seaweed, and sharp rocks at the bottom and the beach stench in late afternoon is almost unbearable. The waves are really strong too it's hard to enjoy swimming. "
YingChang,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2016,Went during low tide .... could walk a long stretch before the dropoff. Water is clear and warm !Good for an early morning n evening dip.

Sandy A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"it is recommended if you decide to swim, the beach and the sands are clean. jogging would be ok while breathing fresh air from the sea"
AUvWorld,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2016,Not the best swimming or surfing beach - but good for a sunbathe and a walk around the many hotels along the beach
Nilesh A,10 contributions,Aug 2016,An ideal place for water activity in bali... really loved the place and all rides.Rides are totally safe and under professional guidance.
Dennis T,"Sligo, Ireland",Oct 2016,"Was taken by our driver to the most northern point of Nusa Dua. Great stretch of the beach, all taken by boats jetskies, them other parachute-paraglide-parasomethings. Definitely your choice for any kimd of boat trip. Trips to Turtle Island go from there, too (cheapest from hundreds of offers was around 250k local money).We were still in the searchfor a place to swim - this one is a big NO, so we moved further south. Next stop - Waterblow.2 beaches just north of it, small peninsula itself and massive beach to the south.Views are breathtaking. But - cant really swim, too shallow. "
El Liron Salvaje,Bucharest,Oct 2016,"It's a quite long stretch of sand, pretty quiet beach, some (small) areas are reserved by hotels in Nusa Dua, meaning they have sunbeds for their guests, but otherwise it's a free pass for everyone, including merchants.If you don't go near the rocks, there's not much to see in the water. At one end of the beach, there's a nice park, guarded by the huge statues of Rama and Laksmana. From this park you have the access path to the Water Blow.I believe towards the other end (opposite from the park) you can do some water sports. All in all it's nice and clean.Stay in the shade during dangerous hours (around 12-2pm) as the sun can burn you really bad."
Deborah,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,Fantastic white sands beautiful clear water couldn't ask for more. Could have stayed on this beach for days all within easy distance to restaurants and other resorts
320quc,8 contributions,Oct 2016,"I went in the morning. The beach is clean and quiet.There is a well built park beside, suitable for cycling or jogging. "
PinnacleTravel88,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is a beautiful peaceful beach. The beach is also where most of the big name hotels are located. Sunset is beautiful and during the day is not too crowded
Barsukolga,"Moscow, Russia",Oct 2016,"Second time in nusa dua and sea runs away from me:( Not sure if there is seasonal problem, but I preferred to enjoy swimming in the sea during my holidays"
Thomas Patrick Christensen,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Oct 2016,The beach is long and has lovely white sand and turquoise water. There is a reef about half a Mile out to sea so most of the big waves are dampened down by the time they are near to the shaw. There are lots of water sports and restaurants along the beach with some cheap lunchtime delights on offer. 
CyrusKM101,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2016,"If you are into nightlife and lots of shopping, then do not go to Nusa Dua. The hotels are mostly resort style and away from one another"
Teemu L,"Helsinki, Finland",Aug 2016,"Good clean beach, but swimming is not recommended because of the tides, they great strong currents and water level changes rapidly from morning to evening. For just fast splashes OK, for swimming not so much. Best for tanning or massages. Very good beach walk."
Anna-Maria_Kets,"Offenbach, Germany",Oct 2016,We went there and stayed for a few hours. The beach is very long and mostly clean. Some parts have sea weeds inside.  There are not so many waves so it is suitable for non swimmers. 
katrien420,"Antwerp, Belgium",Sep 2016,Very natural and amazing beach with lots of colors in the water where you can have a quiet swim. The big waves are far away in the sea. Sometimes you can do some snorkeling. Amazing views to the sea from a cliff.
Jazz657,"London, UK",Oct 2016,We are staying at one of the hotels on the beachfront and we have exclusive access to one part of the beach. its a beautiful beach and very quiet and peaceful. White sand and blue water!
abuyukkezer,"Istanbul, Turkey",Oct 2016,Very nice and clean beach . There is some recognizable tide during day. In afternoons you can snorkelling . Very nice underwater view.
anamorar8,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"beautiful beach with clean water and yellow sand , very peaceful .good to swim too as the water tend to be calmer then in other parts of bali "
Sam,"Weymouth, UK",Oct 2016,"We only visited here, we opted against staying here as we wanted to really experience Bali and its culture and this is just full of luxury resorts. However, we would return to Bali and stay here now that we have experienced 'real' Bali. The entire area is landscaped so beautifully, it is maintained to the highest standard and the beaches are second to none with their white sand and incredibly turquoise water. The whole of a Nusa Dua is beautiful!"
RMHMT,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,A short walk or jog from resort hotels. Not crowded and beautiful to walk along in the early morning.
hsinclair90,"Secret Harbour, Australia",Sep 2016,Lovely beach filled with many bars and cafes along the waterfront. Definitely worth an afternoon stroll! 
robertsK5211MM,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"Amazing beach, privacy from stall sellers great. Security is excellent and there are usually plenty of lounges to be had. The beach is cleaned regularly and the water is very clean."
June H,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,It was the 3rd time that I stayed at this hotel  and it just keeps getting better. Staff and facilities are excellent and nothing is too much trouble. Food is to die for. my name is George Hondris my wife June & I came back for the 3rd visit and loved it. We will be back.
Indy D,26 contributions,Sep 2016,"If your staying in Nusa Dua, dont give it a miss. You will walk past this beach on the way to Waterblow and youll probably want to stay here for a while too!"
IncognitoElias,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Sep 2016,Nusa Dua beach is an almost private beach. It is one of the cleanest private beach My wife and I have ever come across.
Mike R,"Woolavington, UK",Sep 2016,"This is a fantastic venue, it's September the water is 26c, at low tide you can walk out 100 metres. Walk for miles on beautiful sand, plenty of cover under palm and other trees. Call at the many 5 star hotels for a refreshing beer or coffee. Safe at anytime of day. "
OneTrueWanderer,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jul 2016,"Clean, scenic and without big waves except high tide, this is a perfect place to start ones day and enjoy couple of other water sports with family. The absence of big waves means, one can enjoy over a greater area with knee length water for longer time. Absence of big waves also reduces danger and eye burning sensation. So while extreme water sport enthusiast might be disappointed, the families would enjoy the place much more than most other beaches. Recommended to stay in one of the resorts on beach for awesome holiday so one can use amenities. Lastly beach is clean, well maintained and offers excellent view without much outside crowd apart from hotels."
Alfina C,13 contributions,Sep 2016,"Its great when the tides in, peaceful & clean.The staff at the Grand Hyatt even sweep the beach regularly & no problems with the hawkers, just say no thanks & they move on.  "
natalialee555,"French Riviera - Cote d'Azur, France",Feb 2016,"Watching the sunset is quite beautiful!ÔøΩ. Also the buzz of people communicating, the traders bartering, the music is all amazing!"
lovesweets2,"Avalon Beach, Australia",Sep 2016,"We are staying at The Mulia and have access to Geger beach but was told this beach is great for snorkelling. Our taxi driver drove us on a public road next to club med. from there, it was a short walk to the beach. There are diving pontoon close to club med. down there there are a lot of tropical fishes. It's quite deep but ok to snorkel. Highly recommend. Beach is nice and clean. "
Krisley,"Tarlac, Philippines",Sep 2016,"If you want to spend a day in the beach in convenience then this is the best place for you. You get a nice shoreline, clear water, and hotels/restaurants in walking distance. "
ninhursag,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,Nusa Dua is basically a gated community. A number of hotels are there including Club Med. The beach is kept very clean and tidy and is a great place to relax and take the kids.
amit265,"Indore, India",Jul 2016,"me and my friend went to explore the restaurants located along the side of Nusa Dua beach and we were amazed to see so many good 5 star properties having their restaurants along the beach side. The beach stretch is excelllent giving a good view. Its good to sit in one of these restaurants and enjoy the breeze, music with some drinks and good company"
Anand1351,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"We stayed in Nusa Dua hotel and explored the beach line there and were impressed.Waves are not strong and you can swim, the best stretch is in front of Nusa Dua hotel, crystal clear blue water, nice for a stroll in evening and morning infact anytime I would say."
AmarnathKamath,"Bengaluru, India",Sep 2016,"Went to the beach in the morning. No crowds, nice clean sand. Peaceful place away from the crowds. Unlike the other beaches. "
Rebecca D,"Mareeba, Australia",Sep 2016,Kicked back with friends. Not accosted by local sellers too often. Very clean. Security at either end and patrols so felt very safe. Tour boats leave right from the beach. 
Piyumi G,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Sep 2016,I visited Nusa Dua beach on evenings with my husband during our stay in Bali. The beach is nice and clean. The water looked beautiful. There was an average crowd in the beach and it was not overcrowded. We loved the beauty of the blue waters and the beautiful beach. Lots of people swam and water was not rough.We had a lovely experience there. I definitely recommend this beach over other overcrowded and polluted beaches like Kuta beach.
Anky99,"Houston, TX",Feb 2016,This is the only private beach in Nusa dua and you can access this beach only if you stay in one of the hotels at this beach.Really peaceful and one of the cleanest beach. If you are expedting crystal blue waters.. this is not the place but still one of the best beach in Bali is what i would say!
Julian S,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Sep 2016,We stayed at Kayumanis private Villa and had a short stroll to the beach. The beach near our accommodation and many others was a surprise. The tide goes out exposing what are essentially mud flats. When the tide is in there are no waves which is good and bad. We did see another part of the beach around the corner near the St Regis hotel (where we had dinner). This water apparently does not disappear at low tide so consider accommodation  near here if you love a white sand with water there 24/7
Moser222,"Aarhus, Denmark",Sep 2016,Very beautiful area. White and very good for swimming at high tide. Sadly a tad too much garbage in the water at times though.
Natasha S,"Newton Abbot, UK",Sep 2016,"We went to the public beach for a visit and there was just so much rubbish floating around that day it was sad..it felt very 'resort-y' in this area which wasn't really our thing, although I can imagine the hotels are lovely. I can imagine it could be very nice at this beach but it was ruined by swimming around with plastic."
XCSGMC,"Nieuwegein, The Netherlands",Sep 2016,"The water here is beautiful and quite, perfect for swimming. We loved this side of Bali. There is a lot to do here."
Khaled Hussein,"Tripoli, Lebanon",Sep 2016,Large beach with superb view and water. Always clean. Many staff come everyday to clean the beach from what the sea bring at night time. Very secure. Wonderful trees making shadow on very natural environment.
alamo07109,Amman,Sep 2016,"We stayed at Nusa Dua beach hotel, right on the beach. The beach is clean, lots of space to relax and lounge around. Water is not deep at all which is good for children. Definitely a great place to visit while in Bali."
Kim A,36 contributions,Oct 2015,"The water is clear and calm. More quiet that Kuta beach. However, it wasn't what I was really expecting from Nusa Dua as compared to the beach in Philippines  like Coron or El Nido, Palawan. "
Tiago J,44 contributions,Sep 2016,"This is one of the most nice beaches in Bali, fit for children and adult looking for some rest and swiming. "
MrsA-M-L-B,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2016,"the beach was beautiful,  water was clean,  and there is so much to do along the entire waterfront area, with restaurants, bars, music and massages,  i will def be going back "
ESalvador,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Sep 2016,"Rented 2 beach benches at 200,000 rupiah for 3 hours in a public beach, and enjoyed the beach with my family. Shallow waters were ideal for young kids, but walking  bit further and you are in ""surfing"" part of the beach. Public toilet available, 2000 rupiah to use and lots of food kiosk.Lots of sunshine, not many people and water was nice. Great time."
HunterCleo,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is one of well known beach in South Bali. The beach is clean and well organised with local management. Near here you can find tourist attraction named Waterblow. The beach usually full on public holiday.
RobG-Sydney,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Had a great stay at Awarta Nusa Dua Luxury Villas and Spa. Loved the private pool and gazebo area. Room was spacious and always cleaned to a high standard. Staff and management were very friendly and accomodating and went out of their way to help us find other places and activities. Food was also excellent, large choice for breakfast and room service was always prompt. Spa was also a very high standard, very clean and hygienic and masseuses were experts with great technique. Was a very relaxing and enjoyable time. Totally enjoyed the stay, would definitely recommend it!"
Gaye B,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"good surf ,  clean sand  good for walk buy something from the ladies selling their many bags of colourful sarongs dresses "
Rama A,10 contributions,Sep 2016,"I visited the Nusa Dua Beach during my stay at the Sofitel in Nusa Dua. There was a dedicated Sofitel beach area which was quiet nice. The atmosphere in general is rather relaxed and less populated with locals like the Kuta/ Legion beaches. I would recommend a visit to the beach if you prefer a cleaner and quieter experience. Plenty of water sports and activities available if thats what you're looking to do. Also this beach is relaxing for swim because there is no big wave. This beach also has bits of corals and stones,,,"
Zoran H,40 contributions,Sep 2016,Nice beach and refreshing to swim in - swim out past the reef and you will be within some big waves. At shore the waves are a trickle.
Andrew Gary K,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"the beach was kept extremely clean as workers continued all day raking & burying the seeweed, also physically removing the rubbish that washed up on shore. had a little bit of a surf but mainly just a paddle as wrong time of year for good swell"
55khz,Melbourne,Sep 2016,For an Asian beach it was relatively clean and clear water and sand. I spent most of my time around the Hyatt and it's really pleasant. There is a rip and if you're not a strong swimmer don't go far offshore. There's not really any rocks either where I was. 
Rod R,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Very nice beach for a walk, not that busy & the water is warm & calm, you can kayak or surf if you wish, no paragliding though, thank goodness"
SJC1957,"Cheshire, UK",Sep 2016,"The sea can be a little rough and you need to take care when swimming. Wearing water shoes is recommended as there can be sea urchins , we did see a couple of jelly fish. There is also bits of coral and stones in places so you need to be careful. Each hotel has sun beds available , there are locals selling kites,jewellery and the usual sarongs. They are all very good natured and usually accept ""no thank you"" eventually with a smile. They all wear t shirts with numbers on so its easy to recognise them. At one end of the beach you can walk across to a small island (when the tide is out) and see a lovely temple and super coastal views. Well worth a visit. Be very careful and don't try and swim across in the high tide unless you are a confident swimmer, you can suddenly feel as though you are being swept away. The beach is always being swept so is nice and clean. I think the beach is very popular for Wedding photos, we lost count of the bride and grooms having their photos taken. It was nice to see them in all their lovely wedding outfits on the beach."
MVarma,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"A lot of floating rubbish that some hotels (ayodya) chose the fury rather then pick up, the hotel beach clubs are nice, but the ocean has a strong current so be careful"
Mabel D,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2016,This is one of the best beaches in Bali. Quiet and less tourists around. The blue water & white sands are simply mesmerizing. Good for relaxing. 
Amish Mehta,"Vadodara, India",Sep 2016,The sports are fun. Very clean and good options for rides. My kid enjoyed a lot. There is nothing untoward to report on this location. everything is super best.
badmooie,"Milan, MI",Aug 2016,Too many jet skis but one of the most beautiful ocean views on the planet. Lots of pools and areas for snorkeling. I would like to see worldwide boycott against jet skis and noise maker boats near swimming beaches. They are a hazard and should e kept well off shore
YHN-ID,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"It's beautiful beach .. white sand near beach there are jogging track a lot people bring their dog there in the afternoon .. just be careful with any person who bring dogs there .. it's very often the dog will fight .. they are not bring small cute little dog type .. they are bring pitbull or bigger dog there and one thing i dont like of them ,they're let their dog to pup anywhere they want .. they don't have awareness to keep environment clean. Just open your eyes more when you walking in all thw way to the park ,the jogging track and the grass area. About the beach it was my favourite place actually .. like the sand and tree .. so you can sit and watch the wave and see the horizon .. BUT unfortunatelly some place of this place is not for public .. but its Private beach of the hotel.. if you stay in the hotel around here than you can sit and relax without worrying the hotel security approching to ask you out from the area..."
FiveVe,"Gravesend, UK",Aug 2016,Went to this beach when stayed at Nusa Dua hotel. The beach were cleaner and better view compared to Kuta beach.Good restaurants and shopping mall were within the walking distance from the beach.
vova o,6 contributions,Sep 2016,Perfectly maintained beachfront. Great for swimming at high tides. Clean and quiet. Peaceful place and friendly staff/ trinket sellers. 
azah A,Penang,Sep 2016,A place you should visit in Nusa Dua. There are another two in Kuta but i never had a chance to go. I will comw bacj
Tina G,Italy,Sep 2016,"In some reviews I have read, that this beach is discusting dirty etc. I gaven't found it sooo dirty. The dirt what was laying around was mostly seaweed (if it's too much than there is most likely a polution issue) and plastic bottles and cups. Please guess who throws them away whereever they are? Tourists probably?! I think so, I have seen it! So please stop complaining about a dirty beach if you are throwing away plastic bottles. If you want to do smth to help Bali to manage all the garbage issue please visit R.O.L.E. Fundations (it's also on TripAdvisor).By the way, you can swim there and there is plenty of space to lay down. I have seen several Balinese people cleaning up the beach. As I have written in the title: it could be better, yes! But it could also be a lot worse! "
Sumaiyya  L,London,Sep 2016,Hotel maintained strips are the best here. Lovely white sand and clear water. Wish I spent more time here 
Paul M,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2016,"We used the public area of Nusa Dua beach.  We hired two comfortable padded loungers with a small side table for only 150,000IR for the full day.Numerous places immediately behind beach areas for food and cold drinks - very reasonably priced.Beach is reasonable, golden sands with a very shallow area stretching out across the bay for a good couple of hundred metres out to sea.  Must be protected by a reef as very calm area. Lots of water sports going on but bathing area is roped off for safety.Decent option for a beach day, with Bali Collection shopping mall a few hundred yards away."
Cha√Ømae A,122 contributions,Sep 2016,We loved spending time in nusa dua having fruit juice and chili corn... the watter is clean and sand as well... go go you will lo ve it
DANAH,Kuwait,Sep 2016,the wather is nice the waves are sooo bige the bech was clean but full of see weeds the bech is divaided  to part eatch hotel gets a said with chairs if you are thinking of spending the day thire bring along swiming or diving shoose becous thire is some roks in the see but ober all its very nice 
worldcitizenPerth,"South Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"We stayed at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel and the beach opposite and on either side of the hotel as far as we walked is clean and with few touts and hawkers.  It is a beach for lying on and soaking up the sun.On the other hand, it is hardly worth getting into the sea.  The sea bed is only one to three feet below the surface all the way out to the reef about 250 metres out, and is covered in weed.  It does not invite any frolicking in the water.  You can, if you wish, find a weed-free 5 to 10 square metre patch and just lie in it."
shafeenan,"Guildford, UK",Aug 2016,"Beaches around Bali really are among the best in the world. The Nusa Dua coastline is no exception and a great place for those who like trawling for pretty bits of broken coral, or just walking for miles and miles along the shoreline. The tides are quite varied, offering an opportunity to walk out quite far at low tide but on a falling tide, the undertow is quite strong, particularly for children. If you like bartering, traders wander the sands with everything from glorious kites to pareos."
Lis,"Ramsgate, UK",Sep 2016,"This beach is just so beautiful.  The water lovely and warm but it is September and hot.  I was surprised that it wasn't too crowded and still quiet.  We stayed at the Laguna so perfect for us as so close to the pools and bars of our hotel.  Safe for swimmers with lifeguards on site, not too deep or roughy.  I like how the sand isn't too fine so doesn't stick to you! "
Lodko,167 contributions,Sep 2016,"We enjoyed this beach during our say at Club Med Sept 2016.The whole beach is well kept and seeming clean. There was a couple bits of rubbish in the water, but both the water and sand was extremely clean.Something to keep in mind is the large amount of tidal movement, if you visit in the after you won't be able to swim due to very low tides. Generally, 10am to 1pm is the best swimming time.So thing to be aware of this the possibility of sand lice/flea's. One day I got very badly bitten by sand lice/flea's. This results in a red bump like rash around areas the tiny shrimp like creates get caught in swim my tops and shorts. The rash lasts for a couple of days can is very itchy! Apparently they are more likely during times of higher amounts of seaweed and temperature. You can google it for more info, it's just something to be aware of.To be honest, I did not visit the beach again after this incident.Apart of that, there was nothing particular nasty in the water, no jellyfish or other stinging / overly dangerous animals.The area in front of Club Med also seems to be a popular fishing spot during low tide."
Sara K,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"A fabulous beach!  If the tide is up there is the opportunity for lots of water sports as well as playing in the sand which is still there.  When the tide is low, the shallows are wonderful for relaxing in and there are lots of rockpools to explore.  Wildlife is super!"
dhend85,"Newcastle, Australia",Sep 2016,"Nice clean beach but you have to go at the right tide, low tide exposes a lot of rocks and peak high tide creates strong rips on the northern side"
David P,15 contributions,Aug 2016,Clean and clear water! easy to swim even with crutches.one of the  Better beaches in Bali. Hope to come back soon!
mistermagoo2222,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"Our first trip here....Went snorkelling and did turtle island today with wife and 2 kids 7&9....Firstly reminded me of Kuta shopping strip with the vultures hovering... We booked a snorkel and turtle island...I have dived before so when they gave my kids masks that did not fit I had to step in and make sure they were going to keep changing them until they did... Same as mine....We jumped on a boat( just seaworthy).. The day was average( a little windy) but we didn't know better... After driving through the pandemonium he stopped us over a couple of rock... The daughter was sick, the wife was sick.. After we stopped he gave us life jackets....perplexing... They were for swimming.... We jumped over in the middle of a flotilla of boats ... Saw very little... A few little fish swimming around the rocks, grey coral.. Or what seemed to be coral...He told us we were spending an hour here... Ten minutes later I was done and over the chop...Turtle island was better, people there friendly ... Felt like turtles were in areas too small but what do I know...Coming home was ok till the driver beach the boat and nearly capsized us.. I got out and tried to get the kids out... Got the youngest out then the boat got slammed by a wave causing wife and daughter to get slammed inside the boat.. I got them out as quick as I could before the next wave slammed the boat ...We take safety very seriously in Aus for a reason .....Just be aware that in this country no matter how nice they are do not take safety anywhere even remotely seriously as we do..."
SamanthaNichole,"Baton Rouge, LA",Sep 2016,"A nice, clean swimming beach! Keep an eye out for fast currents, while the low tide water levels are a bit disappointing. "
LA C,27 contributions,Nov 2015,"Wife and I had our wedding on nusa dua beach! Absolutely wonderful! Clear and pristine water, clean and white sand covering the beach! "
ENES86,Idaho,Sep 2016,There are other places on the island that are better but this is easiest to access! Beach is lined with Resorts
VictorTHH,"Hong Kong, China",Aug 2016,"A very beautiful and quiet beach with no major water activity, so you can enjoy some good quiet beach time here."
Dameon G,"Mount Vernon, NY",Aug 2016,This beach was amazing nice white sand and beautiful location. Every hotel has the own private section to lounge on the beach. I stayed at the Amarterra Hotel. The beach is also public you just need to bring your own blanket if you're not staying in a nearby hotel.
M R,14 contributions,Sep 2016,"The first time I'm staying in a 5 Star Hotel with strong baldness properties inside and we'll maintainance. The food was good, the restaurants are nice as well as the great service in the Tamarind Restaurant. You should come and try. Cheers"
Musleh S,Saudi Arabia,Aug 2016,Nusa Dua beach is really nice and got nice view. It is not too crowded and great for swimming or laying on sands. It has trees nearby if it gets hot mid day where you can get shadow.
David E,24 contributions,Aug 2016,"Stayed in one of the resorts facing onto the beach, the beach is wide and expansive, water is safe to swim in.If you are not a guest at one of the resorts you will have to pay to hire a beach bed for the day.Be warned that there are sellers walking up and down all day selling goods and water sport activities.Drinks from the resorts are very expensive,"
Kriti R,India,Jan 2016,"Stunning beach with clear water. the beach is lined with hotels, their landscape areas add beauty to the beach. a great experience to walk along the peaceful beach during sunset."
mirtamay,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Aug 2016,"I loved the beach in Nusa Dua, really enjoyed the sunrises there it's absolutely mind blowing. The color of water is unbelievably beautiful. "
travellor194,"Panjim, India",Sep 2015,"very clean beach,crowded,very peaceful to spend your day and have a drink.lots of water activities can be done here."
joonee,Asia,Aug 2016,"Clean, beautiful beach to spend a whole day. Water is so blue and clear. A lot less crowded here as well."
Robert K,"Rockhampton, Australia",Aug 2016,Nusa Dua beach was a pleasant place to visit lots of places to eat and relax not the cheapest place to either eat or drink in Bali. The beach was nice to walk along however very shallow and lots of coral to cut your feet. I also did not find it very clean and was annoyed by the vendors constantly harassing you to buy their goods.
Travel.Stories.People,"Woodinville, WA",Aug 2016,Nusa Dua beach was great because of the following reasons:1. The beach was clean.2. The beach was not very crowded.3. Bathrooms were clean (paid).4. Sand on the beach was great.5. Hike to the ledge was fun.6. Surrounding park has great statue.Would definitely go back to this beach again.
AnaBee,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"I'm glad we chose to stay at one of the hotels along the Nusa Dua beach, because even though the water did feel a bit frothy and dirty with lots of bits of plastic rubbish floating about, I suspect it is still much better than the more crowded public beaches such as Kuta. Beach was relatively quiet with a few families about, the water was warm and best of all, we only came across two touts the whole morning we were there."
AvoJim,"Minyama, Australia",Aug 2016,"Great beach with swimming, snorkling, flying kites, and in Nusa Dua  area where people are friendly and safe."
RobDowling,"Sliema, Malta",Aug 2016,This is Bali beach....not more to add really. If you manage to get sunrise it's astounding. The waters are clean and refreshing. You just have to do this once in you life. 
LuxTravel321,"London, UK",Jun 2016,"This beach is very picturesque.  Yellow sand and turquoise, warm water. The beach was half-full but still very quiet and peaceful. The only downsides are the sand is a little grainy in a theraputic sort of way at times but not super soft and the sea has quite a few stones and seaweed so it can be a bit uncomfortable to swim in at times.  This beach is best for sunbathing on and if you want to take strolls on the beach."
chitra w,12 contributions,Jun 2016,"Clean, not too crowded with people, quite safe to swim. The sand is clean and almost white, kids will love to play there."
Shirish S,"London, UK",Apr 2016,"very large hotel, staff very freindly and helpful, breakfast excellent. On the beach, away from the congestion of the town, peaceful and relaxing"
cruisingayle,perth wa,May 2016,Great to get out and do some water sports the beaches are great to walk along has some f the best hotels with friendly staff 
Sarla T,"Wilmington, NC",Aug 2016,"Very peaceful beach, it does change depending on the tide some day is great for swimming some others not so much, we stayed at the Grand Hyatt and our beach area was very clean and lots of lounge chairs. However we did walk along the whole beach and noticed that some areas were not as clean, with a lot of garbage. The sand is not absolutely white but the water is very clear and sandy beach, with some coral areas that you can see very clear. We loved this beach, very quiet and peaceful. If you are looking for party atmosphere or surfing, this beach is not for you."
Jeanette O,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"The beach here is amazing, not too crowded, plenty of shade, awesome water and exceptionally clean. There are small food stalls and bars and not too many hawkers to annoy you"
Amit Shah,"Mumbai (Bombay), India",Apr 2016,I would not say this is a  very quite beach. You will find all kind of happening activities to perform with quite time in the evening with your loved ones.Just go and enjoy water sports activities here.
Damien B,"Officer, Australia",Aug 2016,I visited the Nusa Dua Beach during my stay at the Mercure Hotel in Nusa Dua. There was a dedicated Mercure beach area which was quiet nice. The atmosphere in general is rather relaxed and less populated with locals like the Kuta/ Legion beaches. I would recommend a visit to the beach if you prefer a cleaner and quieter experience. Plenty of water sports and activities available if thats what you're looking to do. 
iTravel-A2Z,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"This is a great beach with beautiful sea, hardly ever flat, expect waves and some sea wead. It is beautiful and quiet though compared with Kuta/ Seninyak."
baliyaya,"New York City, NY",Aug 2016,An incredible breathtaking experience through Kayumanis Nusa Dua. Sunrises around 6. Very quiet and serene. The breeze is cool to warm. 
jamnaeem01,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2016,When visiting bali please stay at nusa dua . Lush greenery .. direct access to beaches..kuta was crowded visited a few hours.. dinner jimbaran beach was good ..bubu was good. Para sailing took too long 
sourav g,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Jul 2016,The access of the beach is restricted because of the hotels being built.However we walked down one evening from Grand Bali Hotel took us 15 min walk.They have also a private beach we went one morning where we relaxed for couple of hours.The water looks blue as the eyes wander into the ocean.The depth is not much for couple of hundred metres as the waves break well before it reaches the shore hence the water is gentle and also the children can wade in the shallow water for some distance.The beach is clean with white sand.Enjoyed myself in the water
Sarah S,52 contributions,Aug 2016,Stunning blues at the Indian Ocean. Gorgeous. The beach is mostly lined with a a variety of hotels on either side of dharma island. If you get to the entry of farms island and take a right there are more party hotels and sand bar type locations. To the left are the resort beaches- not sure what access is like if you aren't a guest...but a bit cleaner and a little more quiet 
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"This beach complex is very well maintained, the road lead to this beach is very confusing because it looked like you are in a very expensive housing complex rather than on a beach complex. there are many access to this beach but most of them were privatized by hotel so you must follow the map direction not the direction from your gps. the entrance fee is free. but at the beach you will see that this beach was very commercialized from the hotel that stood on that area. the best place to visit this beach is when the sun rise as the tide will be high and you could see the amazing view."
Shrutee K,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2016,Rode on a 2 wheeler from Seminyak to Nusa Dua. The road connecting the two (through Mandara toll road) is breathtaking. Lots of hotels on the beach offering great variety in food. Strolled for entire afternoon and evening.Highly recommended for the Mandara toll road and leisure walk
Bruno R,13 contributions,Aug 2016,If you want a relaxing quite holiday away from your everyday city life come to nusa dua.Great shopping close byeBeutiful beaches 
yvonnecar,"London, UK",Jul 2016,"Spent a delightful afternoon at this beautiful beach.  Took the Kura Kura bus from Seminyak via Galleria Mall to Ayodya Resort.  You have to walk through this huge hotel to access the beach, then you can hire a beach umbrella and loungers for Rupiah100."
Grenville R,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2016,Good beach..not as crowded as the other beaches in Bali....would visit again if given an opportunity.
Mats N,"Trondheim, Norway",Aug 2016,"Clean super nice beach, it's worth the visit. Lovelely clear water, lot's of restaurants. Would choose a hotel there next time"
DavidS2969UG,"Warwickshire, UK",Aug 2016,Beach is lovely. Very clean with golden sand. Very shallow so kids can paddle around safely. Brought our snorkelling gear but tide was out so didn't see many fish as the water was too shallow.Many bars and restaurants set back from the beach all serving food at reasonable prices.
banyquatro,"Algard, Norway",Jul 2016,Clean and peaceful beach!It is a beautiful long white beach which fades into the distance to a peninsular which has a very large statue.  it was a wonderful way to spend the day.
carolkano,"Sao Paulo, SP",Sep 2015,"the calmest and the best beach ever, also is very clean. Perfect beach for every one and for all activity "
Prizzle,"Oxford, UK",Jul 2016,Really nice beach. Big resorts aren't really my thing but I hired a driver to visit some different beaches particularly ones good for swimming rather than surfing. Not too busy and quite peaceful. Would recommend 
cmwithers91,"Rugby, UK",Aug 2016,"Such a lovey beach! Very blue sea and white sand! Lots of places to walk along the beach and many restaurants! Would probably avoid the hotel restaurants as they are expensive. Walk along to the Bali bay part of the beach and there are a range of places to eat for mostly half the price. People are around the beach trying to sell things, however if you say 'no thank you' they always leave you alone. A must visit in Nusa Dua. Also if it's a windy day you should visit waterboom which is just past the Bali bay section.  "
Julia,"London, UK",Sep 2015,"Nusa Dua Beach is spectacular: beautiful blue water and fine sand, palm trees and tranquillity. Plenty of starfish if you like water life."
BdCTravel,7 contributions,Aug 2016,I could move here in a heart beat. Love the beach. My favourite place is Westin at Nusa Dua. Great restaurants. Lot of things to do.
Mayurpatell,"Jaipur, India",Jul 2016,This is a one of the nice beach for privacy and less crowd in Nusa Dua. Almost resorts having its privet beach area here.
Achibitsy,"Bucharest, Romania",Aug 2016,"As all resorts are there, the bars and restaurants on the beach are quite expensive. Beautiful beach though and great place to relax."
Jeremy W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,The beaches at the Nusa Dua complex are kept really clean as they are in front of some really expensive hotel. Lots of inexpensive warungs and beach clubs for those not staying at the hotels. If driving there it is one of the few spots in the south of the island where it is still possible to park without some locals charging for it.
garylamba,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"Stayed at Westin and chilled by beach on daily basis , beach has high tide from sunrise to around 2ish and then beach becomes more of rocky beach and tourists walk around and explore the rocky areas.You don't get harassed by people that much  trying to sell and all hotels have their private areas so you get constant supply of drinks , food , towels etc."
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"It locates in the corner of the island, beautiful beach, very clear water. Crowded people on the weekend, not only foreigner enjoying the place, but also local people with their children spread out the carpet on the beach, and enjoying their snacks and drink. No ticket to access this beach."
Globerwalker,"Seoul, South Korea",Jul 2016,"The beach was kept very clean, had nice white sand and blue water, deep enough to swim in and not too rough. There are places around to buy food and drink, but the roving vendors are a bit annoying.  An enjoyable place to visit."
ritascas,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,"Cannot fault anything... from staff, rooms, service and location.Paradise! Very relaxing soaking in the sun, beautiful pools, great food."
HansenDKK,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jul 2016,When the tide is not low Nusa Dua Beach is really nice and you can snorkel right as you get into the water. You will see around 20-30 different species close to the costal line.
Claire M,"Leatherhead, UK",Sep 2015,Beautiful and clean beach. One of the best things being there was very little litter or hassle from sellers like on a lot of beaches in Bali. 
DeHeavenTour Official,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2016,Bali has many beaches. But nusa dua is one of the best for family / honey mooner to visit Bali. The scenery is amazing. Wave is very friendly..even the sand is a bit rough. Many nice restaurants to hang out/chilling. No wonder so many 5 star hotel having the wedding ceremony on nusa dua beach. 
Danny T,"Newbury, UK",Aug 2016,"Nicest beach I have ever seen, pale yellow soft sand, warm sea and views for miles...There are a few hawkers selling kites, sarongs etc.  But they are friendly and gentle 'no thank you' sees them move on."
RAVI K,"Chennai (Madras), India",Aug 2016,I am yet to see such a long stretch of  a very well maintained and clean beach in these parts. Evenings are great for a 7 km walk down this beach.
Desislava D,Bulgaria,Jun 2016,"We stayed at Melia for one week. The beach was not overcrowded. It was clean and safe, perfect to swimming, before the low tide, with golden sand. It was perfect to taking pictures. Love it!"
Maureen W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Stayed at the NUSA DUA BEACH HOTEL  A complete relaxation holiday for couples families and singles. The Hotel staff are exceptional and caring, location is great you  have sun, sand beach, walks eat drink and totally relax and meet some new friends."
Lou C,"Havelock North, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"We went to the public area of the beach. Not many people on the beach infact about 4! A clean safe beach to swim in with golden sand. Back from the beach are the usual stalls selling food, drink and everything else."
Achmad Maulana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Stay In Bali National Golf Resort, walked along the Nusa dua beach, bliss full and quite place, nice sandy beach with food stall sell along the beach belong to each hotel in ITDC, very attractive and comfort place to hanging around with friends or family, as its equipped with jogging track along the coast, dont worry about the food and drink, from cheapest to expensive are available along the beach, from small hut to luxurious club also available"
khengsoon,penang,Jul 2016,This beach was very windy when I was there. I enjoyed just sitting there and strolled along the beach with many scenic corners for photo shooting. Worth visiting the place again
Hitesh Patel,"Harrow, UK",Aug 2016,"Stayed at Grand Hyatt and as expected you get what you pay for!Very large resort, may not suit everyone so please check if suitable for family."
Oleg S,176 contributions,Aug 2016,"Nice view, ocean with sand beach, lots of hotel on the beach, lots of security stuff everywhere, wonderful nature trees, birds, small animals"
Bipashyee,"London, UK",Jun 2016,"We stayed for a couple of days in Nusa Dua and checked out the beach. It wasn't amazing, as we expected. It was a golden sand beach - long stretch and wasn't much dramatic. It was still nice to hang out in, to swim and spend time with family, but I wouldnt go to Nusa Dua all the way to check out this beach. "
PrithviHaldea,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2016,"Worth a visit, a vast long beach...However, too many stones on the shore took some pleasure away. Nice beach eating joints."
Sharon W,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2016,"This is a lovely beach but my husband went body surfing and he hurt his neck quite badly.  He is an experienced body surfer, been around water for 40+ years but he still got dumped by the waves.  We were really lucky that he didn't do too much damage.  Those waves are powerful."
ulnirmal,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Jul 2016,This beach is a nice place to relax during holidays. Calm and quite beach with clean waters. mind relaxing
wendy j,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2016,Lovely beach. Quiet for Bali    Nice Cafes restaurants beach hire.   Cool and clean.  Nice for families.  Saw some flagged area.  Calm. Lovely.  Can get massage.  Not many hawkers.  
McWitch,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"It's hard to rate beaches highly when you come from Australia and are spoilt by beautiful wide beaches.  The sand isn't white like you see in all the pictures, but it's lovely and calm waters are inviting nonetheless.  At low tide, watch out for sea urchins!!"
Steph Y,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Clean beach with Ma y places to sit and relax. Minimal people harassing you and security along the beach as well as a life guard or two.
WW_Traveller_1965,"Milan, Italy",Aug 2016,This beach is long and nice to walk on. Most of the Nusa Dua best resorts are there. However we were very disappointed to find garbage like plastic bags and bottles as well as other human waste on both the sand and the water. Those hotels should pay  more attention on it!
Timo K,"Espoo, Finland",Aug 2016,The beach seems to be more or less restricted for the big hotels offering packages for chairs with food. You can still find independent places where you can eat or drink. I had an afternoon walk from my hotel and back. Luck√≠ly it was windy and not too hot.
ztakacs1973,"Novi Sad, Serbia",Jul 2016,beautiful water IF no storm!!! otherwise full of plastic debris! the nearby park is worth a visit. the sellers at the beach are not too pushy. you can find great deals at the beach when people are offering nearby sports activities! bargain!!!
ruli,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"This beach is very nice,clean and not too crowded compare to kuta...the place is romantic if you stay in the resort of nusa dua...one the best beach in bali üëç"
Martin A,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2016,Sorry but it's a nice beach not a great one.  It's okay is how I would put it.  Make sure you have a good pool at your hotel and you will be fine.
pameilama,Switzerland,Jul 2016,"The Nusa Dua Beach is a very clean and tidy beach area with a lot of potential! In our one week holiday at Nusa Dua we spent about 3 days relaxing and hanging around at the beach and it was quite nice. The sand is brown, very clean but not that smooth. During the day the water level was low tide but clean. There a few locals trying to sell you stuff but they understand a simple no thank you and will then leave you alone."
Peter S,"Liverpool, UK",Sep 2015,"This beach is for lovers too, and you will leave your footprints. Clean is not a word, this place is stunning clean. "
Melly,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,Nusa Dua beach located in Nusa Dua complex. Most of the beach is in front of the hotel or hotel beach walk. Must visit water blow spot. Amazing view from wave blow into the reef. 
talven,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Beautiful for a walk or jog in the morning and water is blue and beautiful. However, when we were there there were warnings up regarding jellyfish and other sea creatures due to the winds so we decided to have a quick dip in the warm water and then move to the pools in our resort. But definitely a peaceful place to sit down and read a good book!"
Young L,"Cypress, Texas, United States",Jul 2016,"This is an OK beach, not great for swimming, but if you like water activities, this is it.  This beach is much quieter, not too crowded."
Domi Nik,"Ennetbuergen, Switzerland",Aug 2016,Very nice and calm beach with withe sand and beautiful view to the horizon. Perfect water conditions clean beach and ideal for kids as they can walk into the sea.
sevjenh,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2016,"Overcrowded, with lots of boats going around the snorkeling site, which made us skip the snorkeling. The site was also full of people seawalking, probably scaring off whatever fish was there in the first place. Saw nothing but kelp from the glass bottom boat. The area is close to some sort of industrial dock, and didn't smell good. The water is really dirty and full of trash. This is a horrible tourist-machine and complete rip-off!"
Timtamtummy,"Changi, Singapore",Jul 2016,"Lovely beach promenade to walk along (you can push a stroller along the path easily), and you get to see the different resorts. Beach is great too. "
RoystaDoysta,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"As most people will point out this is a great place to walk or hire a bike for a long ride. The beaches are good and there are a few places to see like the blowhole and the temple island. There are lots of bars and restaurants along the way north of the blowhole, and a huge open beach south of it. Great for chilling and spending a day..."
luiting,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,"clean beach, soft sand, free of rocks! Loved it! But the bars and beach clubs there are definitely catered to tourists, at a higher price of course! "
FastTreck,"Valsad, India",Jun 2016,"Beautiful and clean beach to spend valuable time with friend and family, Mostly visit in early morning or in evening time to get good weather."
robfratelli,"London, UK",Jul 2016,"The waters dirty with rubbish and lots of seaweed and isn't the crystal clear waters you expect from a place like Bali.Not much character either, safe to say we stuck to our hotel pool.We stayed at Grand Mirage."
hieronymus67,"Beachwood, OH",Jul 2016,"Beautiful beach. Very clean. Very friendly local people offering a massage, water sports activities, or to sell some local souvenirs. Undeep waters. Very safe. Very predictable tide. "
irwan e,75 contributions,Jul 2016,"I stay in the Grand Whiz Hotel, next to the Sofitel. So only 3 min walk to the beachThe beach is clean and the sea is calm. So you can swim around the area of near the Club Med hotel.The beach itself is a public space, but you cant use the coach/sofa in of the Club Med, unless you are the guest of that hotel.This is really a perfect spot to see sunrise"
amit s,"London, UK",Jul 2016,if you're staying in Nusa dua your resort will be connected to the beach. it's conviniently close by and enjoyable to spend an afternoon relaxing.
Husain R,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,loved the blue waters & tranquility. It was very peaceful & quiet and since it was a private kind of beach it was secure too
Priya P,"Leicestershire, UK",Jul 2016,"The beach itself is lovely and stretches out far beyond the eye can see! However, one thing I was quite disheartened by was the amount of plastic bottles, crisp packets and general rubbish floating around the shallows. However, on some days, staff cleaned this up. There is no shortage of water activities at the beach. You're generally taken a little speedboat ride away from the swimmers to avoid any accidents, where you can find banana boating, water sleding (or flyfishing), jet skiing, parasailing, etc. For dining, there are plenty of restaurants to choose from. Definitely worth a relaxing visit."
rubyroomaisymoo,"Bournemouth, UK",May 2016,"The hotel was wonderful and everywhere was very clean, the food was amazing and we were given a huge choice. I needed to change my room and they did this very quickly. Ideal family Hotel, 2 beautiful pools lots of places to eat and very safe. I would go back there on my next visit."
b4eve,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2016,Perfect water quality like an island not a main land beach but only a tiny bit of beach is public most belongs to the expensive resorts.  It's still nice enough for a day and the restaurant has all you need for refreshments plus 25k beach chairs or towels
VivekDalal,"Lusaka, Zambia",May 2016,nice and clean beach. too crowded in evenings. lots of restaurants around. live music was also playing in some of them. perfect for clicking pics 
jua83,"Paarl, South Africa",Jul 2016,Have been travelling all over Bali I would recommend Nusa Dua for families travelling with small kids. Nice family resorts can be found in this area.
potatolord 5,72 contributions,Jul 2016,Probably the best beach we saw in Bali. The sand was more yellow than other beaches we visited. There was plenty of trash in the sea and in the morning it appears that the various beachfront hotels rake up the trash and bury it on the beach. I didn't see any lifeguards. We did see a few fish in the sea along with one small sea snake although the water was a bit churned up for snorkeling.
Sonya G,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Stayed at Nusa Dua in Ayodya Resort which was lovely and had a well-maintained beach.  Staff cleaned the beach of rubbish washed up onto the sand and dug the seaweed back into the sand.  We went for a swim once in 7 days.  The water has seaweed and rubbish floating in the water.  We swam between the flags further down the beach - however, there was still an undertow where the flags were located and a strong pull - definitely not a place to lose your footing or have children have a swim.  The flags didn't move the whole 7 days - so rips and undercurrents don't move and are there safer areas to swim on certain days than others?I guess I'm used to the beautiful, well-patrolled beaches of the Gold Coast and Perth, Australia."
Sigitpramono,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"I prefer this beach than Kuta Beach due to quite and beautiful. white sand beach and good enough wave....laid down on sand and enjoy sunshine...I love Bali. the beach is clean and not many sellers move around offer their product. Indeed, more comfortable and love this beach so much. "
JakoMD,"Hovik, Norway",Jul 2016,"Stayed at the Melia. The beach was perfect for our kids 3, 9 and 11. Very shallow at low tide. Nice atmosphere. Good service at the Level."
Costi_Miu,"Heilbronn, Germany",Jul 2016,It's quite different from place to place. The beach by hotel grand Niko is pretty good especially for family with kids but there are some other much beautiful places. Especially for surfing and singles.
David W,Hong Kong,Jul 2016,Expansive beach with knee high wavesA bit of soft rubbish but nice enough. A few hidden rocks  but nothing dramatic and the bigger waves are out the back! 
MonaR24,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2016,I was there in Jan 2016.The beach is beautiful with alot of water sports activities to choose from.Definitely worth going.
travelbugsme,Singapore,Jun 2016,"Calm beach to be compared to some other benches in Bali. Not very crowded as each hotel maintain their own area. Seen a few locals trying to sell tourist their loots, was pretty alright when been rejected."
Vera N,3 contributions,Jul 2016,Some places are very dirty at the beach. So many plastic bottles and screwtops and plasticbags. At some parts of the beach where the top hotels are you get shushed away by security guards. 
Leah M,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"An absolutely stunning Beach, super clear water and so clean in general. Never over crowded, plenty of places to eat/snack in he enclave of hotels! The best private beach I've ever been to! "
gaylemac2016,"Glasgow, UK",Jul 2016,Stunning beach! Clean sand with turquoise waters.  Just paradise and good for families with only a small amount of water sports so it felt fairly safe. 
theRoamingMurphys,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2016,"This is a beautiful beach... white sand and not too busy, though it is public. We found there to be a little too much garbage floating in the water to want to swim, but sitting at the beach was lovely. Be wary of the beach vendors though, they are very nice but very persistent. "
manjeet a,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"The beach is wide and has mangrove trees at certain parts if you are looking for shade. It has a great walking pathway which is used by cyclists and walkers between the many resorts and hotels situated along the beach. There are a lot of food outlets and excellent restaurants for a really wonderful time at the beach, not to mention the lovely massage ladies and their attractive prices. Be sure to haggle with them."
katty403,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Most beautiful clean beach  lounges right to the sand and beaut beach bar and food available lovely end of day watching the sun go down 
Winnie19821987,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Stayed first week in Tanjung Benoa. DO NOT GO THERE. Went on the the beach  and all you can smell is the fumes from the boat engines and you can't swim. It's disgusting. Nusa Dua is quiet, clean sand, clear water and no water sports going on. Lovely, must see..."
Dianne H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"I visited the beach early June 2016.I was delighted with the facilities the Amarterra Villa provided on their section of the beach. Its a beautiful long white beach which fades into the distance to a peninsular which has a very large statue and roofs popping over the top of the surrounding trees. I thought it would be a great spot for photos of the sunrise. It didn't disappoint me! I had an easy walk along the beach amongst the sea shells, rocks and a small amount of seaweed. I captured some lovely photos of the sun rising, and the waves crashing around the peninsular which sent spray up into the air. A lovely white beach that was easy to walk on and very pleasant to look at."
rbhambha,"Santa Cruz, CA",May 2016,"Nusa Dua was my favorite of all beaches I visited during my time in Bali. It's super chill, clean, and lovely. I spent most of my time lying out on my chair under an umbrella, occasionally taking a dip, and it was a wonderful way to spend the day. Stayed here for a good 6 hours or so. The food being served was cheap and quite good, with the service also being good. All in all, I highly recommend spending a day here, and invest in an umbrella. It's worth it."
miralpatel309 .,38 contributions,Feb 2016,"I had been there from 12thfeb to 14th Feb. It is really a nice place for newly married couple. All places like hotel,restaurants, bars,and local markets are near to beach. And beach is also quiet good. And u can experience a clean water on beach. A local peoples and vendors are also quiet good and helpfull. It is really a good experience in Bali. "
Travelloverlady,"London, UK",Jul 2016,"The beach provides great people watching and easy walking opportunities, the neat and helpful pathway along it also enables you to cycle round this area very easily.  The reef that protects the beach from big waves does hamper any major sailing opportunities."
Allymharris,34 contributions,Jul 2016,"Stunning beach!! Very clean! there are so many wonderful watersports at your fingertips. There are also loads of beach clubs where you can go, order drinks and relax on a lounger. Great place cleanest beach I've seen in Bali "
"John, D.","New York City, NY",Jul 2016,"When it is low tide (most of the day), the beach is disgusting and very shallow until the reef barrier (and you can't pass the reef barrier as waves are too high), no swimming or snorkeling possible.The only ""clean"" areas from the beach are located in front of resorts, who decided these would became ""private"" beaches.There are guards patrolling everywhere and chasing travelers. They will try to extort 363,500 Rp from you, claiming this is a ""resort fee"" (yep, more than in Vegas!) and if you refuse, you will have to walk back to the gate.Pathetic given the amount of money they are making with tourists, do yourself a huge favor and skip this place!"
ThompsonBuggins,"Bushmills, UK",Aug 2015,"We went there for our final day in Bali. Our hired driver and friend took us to a public beach between the fancy hotels. There were a few restaurants with local food and beach benches to rent. We stayed in the water the entire time. The temperature was perfect. The sand and ocean beautiful like a postcard. The further you walked away from the main area, the prettier and emptier as none of the hotel guests seemed to use the beach. Local fishermen were seen fishing from their boats and nets. It was all so beautiful and a lovely day out for our entire family. Crystal clear waters. "
Rochelle_NM,"London, UK",Jun 2016,You must visit this beach absolutely beautiful with a few places to purchase food and drink while you soak up the sun!!
Nellie B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,We stayed at the Ayodya Resort and absolutely loved the patrolled beach next to it. We swam a lot. The water is warm and clean - very enjoyable. 
HeatherG88,"Wamberal, Australia",Jul 2016,We have stayed here a number pf times now And It has a great family vibe. We love The Different restaurants around And The board walk that front some of The Big Hotels. A very safe area With lots to do if you like water sports or you can just Lay around And do nothing!
Hanson,8 contributions,Jun 2016,further away from the crowds and much cleaner than the Kuta beaches and great reeg walks at low tide. 
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"We last visited this area 30 years ago. Wow has it changed! Such a beautiful area. Beach is awesome, grassed area so clean no cars or bikes so great to enjoy an area without hassles."
mishii_mis,Slovakia,Jun 2016,"The beach is nice one of the better ones in Bali, but nothing really spectacular. Bali is not an island of stunning beaches though (with few exceptions). Bali is about something different. Water is quite shallow so good for smaller kids. The beach offers beautiful sunsets and is good for a morning/evening walk. "
hanaicha,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"quiet and clean beach, my fave beach so far in bali. really love the sun-kissed hair and warm sand while walking without any sandals or shoes. will re-visit this place for sure."
James S,4 contributions,Jul 2016,Early morning walks i.e. 6am down the beach path are worth getting up for. The sunrise which was around 6.30am in July was spectacular. You also get to see the other facilities such as Sofitel and Westin.
Rodney P,4 contributions,Jul 2016,"Sofitel, Nusa Dua is very special! Try it!!!! It is a recommendation that I make lightly. Enjoy the wonderful atmosphere! In the Kwee-Zeen restaurant, be cared for by Tarka and Dedi, who work so hard to make the dining experience so special.Enjoy!"
Julieta G,"Braga, Portugal",Jul 2016,Warm and blues Water and the white sand are the perfect match!!!We love the quite and the possibilita of swimm :)
rakeshsureka,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2016,Awesome view of clear water... The horizon where blue meets blue... A must visit beach in south Bali...Lots of nice hotels and resorts in the area...The beach is well maintained and free from dirt... You will feel like going in water again and again...
Mazzaydc,"Busselton, Australia",Jul 2016,Such a beautiful beach with lovely luxurious hotels...but soo dirty - shameful really that these resorts don't take some responsibility for cleaning it up! 
stalin,mumbai,May 2016,"White sandy beach, clear waters. Lots of water sports activities . Very expensive to hire water scooters. They also organise Turtle conservation island tours which is not worth the effort nothing to see there Waves are gentle and relaxing..Options for food are limited. worth a half day trip from Kuta  The road on stilts in the sea leading to Nusa Dua is very scenic and worth a drive."
Fulya Y,74 contributions,Jul 2016,"Not cold water. Sea is clean and beach crew clean the everywhere. No stones, no trash and so peacefull air. Sea has wave everytime but it's so funny."
rathi_john,13 contributions,Jun 2016,Lovely beach with plenty of walkways. But there were plenty of tourists from China who were really loud and spitting everywhere. 
berkyrs,"Ankara, Turkey",Jul 2016,"It was a windy day, so there were lots of rubbish on the sand. It was really dirty. But hotel employees were trying to clean the beach. Despite everything sea color is beatiful. "
Daniel P,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,The beach is not meant to be played with the kids.. It is full of coral and the sand is a bit dirty... Yet the view is amazing!
yifanflying,"Shanghai, China",Jul 2016,Nusa Dua Beach is more clean than Kuta and very beautiful. You can enjoy more by some private beach such St.Regis Resort
s_klafko,"Bergen, Norway",Jul 2016,"Beach looks ok, but definitely no place for bathing in the sea. Dirty water. Nicest areas in front of huge resorts with signs warning against going in the sea! Only suited as scenic back drop for the luxury hotels and for water sports. For the really nice beaches and great bathing head to towards Padang Padang, kind of crowded but not a problem."
adrndragan,"Bucharest, Romania",Jul 2016,"Nusa Dua beach , right along the The Laguna resort offers an excellent relaxing , quite time , under the dense exotic vegetation .The ocean is warm and long baths are making the day .  Bad point : every day I picked plastics from the ocean thrown mainly by locals and turists. This is really shame for all of us ..."
Frank M,Europe,Jul 2016,"From reading other reviews, there have been deaths at the beach due to the rough water. It is actually deceiving as the shoreline break appears tame compared to the offshore one. The issue here is that there are no lifeguards patrolling the beach so you venture at your own risk. This surprised me given the myriad of resorts that define this location. I had a scare when my kayak capsized at the offshore break and the relentless string of waves made it tough to catch your breath and make a go at returning to shore. Be sure to wear life jackets so you can enjoy the waves without excess peril "
Gunawan K,7 contributions,Jul 2016,If you like quite and clean beach..you must come to this beach..It feel the beach is your own...Slow wave and safe for children to swim..
Dariusz S,11 contributions,Jul 2016,"Beach is fantastic, even the people that try and sell you things are nice and not pushy. I recommed it"
DGK65,"Washington DC, DC",Jul 2016,"The beach is huge, but large selection has the rocks here and there. Better to ware the rubber shoes going down the water, especially for the younger kids"
Surfweb,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2016,The luxury hotels front this beach and there is not much sand to actually call it a beach. The hotel pools are more appealing. At this time of year there is meant to be trade winds blowing and mild weather. Unfortunately it was raining most of the time. Not good beach weather.Still it has a very nice atmosphere and views.Nusa Dua is a place to relax away from the hectic traffic and crowds in Kuta. It's a good family beach. Safe for young children to play if kept close to shore.
Anna K,4 contributions,Jul 2016,So far the better and clearer beach I see in Nusa Dua. Lots of visitors but the beach was well maintain and good for swimming.
rebecca h,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nusa Dua reminds me of Denaurau in Fiji. It's a nice beach but it lacks what the rest of Bali offers as far as a destination is concerned, it's basically conservative at best. It is expensive because unlike Seminyak it doesn't offer a lot outside of the actual resorts. Yes you could do 2 nights here but anymore would probably drive you a little mad unless you were wanting complete rest, poolside reading and not much else."
Ian F,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2016,"The beach areas in this gated area are very clean for the majority of the time. Beach cleaners are on duty all day ensuring that the area is clear of rubbish and debris. Having said that, some ignorant tourists cannot help themselves and do make extra work for the beach cleaners. There are areas particularly at low tide where there are patches of sea weed and this is an area where Sea Urchins can be found and if stood on or handled, they can cause some considerable pain (personal experience!) Resort medical clinics are used to dealing with the multiple wounds caused by these creatures if attended to promptly, Great swimming and medium surf, a very safe environment and even for the kids at the time when the tides are not moving. Tidal movement is easily found out through resort staff or internet. Foot ware is recommended for some help against Urchin spikes and the occasional sharp pieces of coral that will wash up from the reef that is further out from the beach area."
Trevor J,33 contributions,Jun 2016,The beaches in Nusa Dua are far nicer and a lot cleaner than those near Kuta or Jimbaran Bay. There was a lot less litter and the sand was far better. The under toe can be pretty strong in places though.
Anneta M,"Eguisheim, France",Jul 2016,"The beach is very nice, there aren't a lot of people so you can swim and sunbathe relaxed on your own. You have many activities to do as well like padel surfing, surfing, parachuting, banana, flying fish... And more! Also you cand find many people selling diferent things so you don't get bored! "
varindertoor,"Chandigarh, India",Jun 2016,Ritz Carlton Nusa Dua is heaven on earth ! It's a must and we loved every second of it. Great ambience and smiling staff make the moments memorable one.Loved every bit of our stay. Thanks to them.
Michelle B,"Hamilton Hill, Australia",Jul 2016,Brilliant beautiful clean relaxing beach lots of swimming fishing surfing and much more exciting things to join in with 
Kimberly,119 contributions,Jul 2016,Great great beach. Lovely! The flags will tell you whether it's safe to go or not. Nice place for a getaway or a holiday. Pricey because it's a tourist place. Many ang moh and everyone can speak English. 
Sumaya Al Attar,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2016,"Beautiful city, and down to earth people. I'm in love with this place. Though I suffered from the humidity, I still enjoyed my time visiting the temples and watching the Kechuk dance, sacred monkey forest... Got me loads of Luwak coffee too. "
TomiCiglenecki,2 contributions,May 2016,"Good snorkelling place, with shallow water and abundance of corral and sea life. Also nice for walks by the beach. "
Susan H,99 contributions,Jun 2016,"Was just there in June 2016, it was great! Very sandy and safe but shallow. Not a lot of people around."
TC77Syd,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,We found Nusa Dua really boring. Most restaurants and bars are part of the hotels so you don't really have the option to head into the town and find a great bar or restaurant. I'm sure the hotel ones are great but unlike Seminyak or Jimbaran Bay there are amazing restaurants you can stumble upon.The only shopping option really is Bali collection. Great if you're looking for nick nacks or clothing but it lacks atmosphere. You wouldn't necessarily head here for a day out. I think we spent about an hour here
travelerxhan,California,Jun 2016,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt Bali and were right in front of Nusa Dua Beach. The beach is gorgeous--very fine sand and the water is nice and warm. You can also learn to surf there so that's quite nice. The only downside was that there were so much trash floating around the beach area--we picked things up for only a few minutes and had a great big pile of trash. Considering it's a resort area, we were surprised that there was so much trash. I would like to clarify that is not like it's a landfill but when you look closely, you can see plastic bottles, plastic wrappers, etc everywhere. We liked the beach but it was depressing to see as we are both divers and know that all of this trash eventually ends up in the oceans and could harm marinelife."
R_Sweden,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2016,"First of all, this is not really Bali. But the beach is clean, have no big waves and water is clean. All luxurious hotels is in front of the beach is here back to back. You won't find the daily Bali beach life here. You find your own privet hotel beach with sun beds. "
brenny68,"Littlehampton, Australia",Jun 2016,"Love Nusa Dua.  My favourite local balianese cab driver is TJ, he is a local to the area, speaks English really well and a wonderful tour guide if you ask questions along the way.   Our whole family have used him or his family/friends for travelling around Bali.  He will drive you around all day for about 50 AU.  Ring 085935102585  I usually get the hotel to ring him and then we speak with him and discuss a price."
Biztraveller15,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,The higher king tides and rough weather had destroyed the beach area and the erosion had gotten past the stone retaining walls and had started to eat in to the front lawn areas of the restaurants that front the beach.
Nopuma,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2016,"Quite disappointed with this beach and so were my boys who were travelling out of the U.S. for the first time.  I suppose my husband and I are spoiled by the beaches of Grand Cayman, Turks and Caicos, or  the absolute clear waters of Bora Bora, so I will just report what we observed as best I could.There were four areas where we where that had lounge chairs.  One charged, 365,000 IDR per person (approx. $28/pp), we chose the ones closest to the end of the beach next to a hut with a bar and dining area.  Food was ok and a bit more expensive than usual but that was expected.  There were quite a few vendors selling jewelry, kites, sarongs, and paintings, walking around.  They were respectful until one in the end of the day, who was a bit aggressive about his sales tactics.The beach was a bit crowded. Lots of seaweed and washed up rubbish as others previously mentioned. We will not return."
Seow F,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,"Even for a stroll, it was very relaxing.  With backup facilities and services from the hotel within reach."
Sudhir C,"Doha, Qatar",Jun 2016,Good beach for visit in day time close to the city. There are hotels offering transport to the beach. The penensula garden is close by with the water hole to see some splashing.
Shaun S,"Ballarat, Australia",Jun 2016,Having walked the length of this beach there does appear to be some resorts who put a little extra effort in cleaning up the beach front than others. There is a reef pretty close in and this appears to be popular with local fishermen at night. The swimming area is contained within a line of buoys. The walkway up from the beach is clean but again it appears that each resort looks after it's own strip. Popular with runners and people out for a walk. The local sellers aren't overly imposing and a range of items are available for sale.
Phil G,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Stayed at the Melia Bali resort at the southern end  of Nusa Dua beach which is certainly the more picturesque end of the beach. (Same locale as the Westin resort) Also close to Bali Collection which is the only local shopping area.  The lagoon is also protected from the prevailing wind so great play to try stand up paddle boarding.  As you head north things become a bit more basic with parts of the walking path washed away and lots of rubbish around. Similarly as you go south towards the Hyatt parts of the pathway has also been washed away like everywhere in Bali you have to pick your spot!
Margie I,"Tampa, Florida, United States",May 2016,It was worth the trip to see the Nusa Dua Beach in Bali!The sand was white- the water crystal clear!There was a barrier so that you could swim out and enjoy the water without worrying about the waves & current taking you away!
Andresguia,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2016,"Nusa Dua Beach is among the most beautiful beaches of Bali, a stretch of white sandy beach with palm trees and blue water with coral reefs where live dozens of colorful fishes. This is an ideal place for sunbathing and swimming as the coral reefs make it like a little lagoon protecting us from the deep water. The strolls at the long beach is a beautiful experience."
Stephen M,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"A nice beach. Wide, good sand and at least a few km long. There is a walking or cycling path along almost the entire length which has right of way through the hotels that front the beach. The beach is protected by a reef and the waves break out on the reef. Much of the beach is safe with only small waves (eastern, blow hole island end). However the beach is more dangerous along near the Novotel beach club - there is a strong current there at times. There are some life guards but I would not rely on them. Be careful. The surf break out on the reef seems to work ok at times but I am not a surfer. The water is fairly clean but there is some floating rubbish. The hotels that front the beach keep the sand clean. The beach is very shallow at low tide right out to the reef. No good for swimming or anything at low tide. We stayed in the Courtyard hotel and their beach club at the eastern end of the beach near the blow hole island is great with sun chairs etc. Many of the other hotels provide sun chairs as well.You can rent surf boards and paddle boards at various places along the beach. Not the best beach I have been to by any measure but not bad. We enjoyed it. "
Totumgirl,Australia,Jun 2016,This beach is dirty with lots of rubbish washed up on the sand. The walking path along the beach is also very dangerous and most of it has been washed away. The beach has a lot of rock/concrete in it so be careful not to cut your feet. Don't waste your time visiting this beach
Azamat K,"Moscow, Russia",Jun 2016,"Almost no waves and no surfers, but sand and water are beautiful and beach is great to spend time with family."
Mrhamlet,58 contributions,Jun 2016,We like the Beach and the area and there are a lot of nice hotels along the Beach. The are also a big shoppingcenter close and they have ok restaurants and many shopps. The pricerange are a litle bit higher here then lets say in Sanur or Ubud. The Beach can be a bit dirty some Times' with things from the sea. We will be back. 
Maturity,"Western Australia, Australia",Jun 2016,There were plenty of beach chairs under shady trees on this lovely beach. The sea had quite an undertow though. Beach vendors approached with saris etc for sale but were no problem.
Alex R,129 contributions,Jun 2016,You can swim before 13:00 only! Lots of dust and remnants this time of the year! Afternoon is busy time for swimming pool! But only one in the hotel! Today I fished out of the sea a big door! Follow the other pictures I have made:)
AmyHickson,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,We have stayed in Nusa Dua on many occasions and quite often we visit the beach to lounge on the chairs. The beach is always clean and tidy with workers there throughout the day to rake the beach and bury the seaweed. The water is clean and you can swim in the water without worry. Nusa Dua Beach is MUCH nicer than Seminyak and really is a lovely beach to visit.

chris,"Cebu City, Philippines",May 2016,Didn't have the time to take a swim but the sight and sounds of the big waves are relaxing.  There are so many restaurants to have a romantic dinner.  The place is also not crowded.
Tbcbusboy,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,"It's only nice on the private beach available to luxury Travellers staying at the resorts there. If you go to the public side, you'll realise that it's very messy and still has some wreckage from the large waves."
Ray K,8 contributions,Jun 2016,"I like this place also beautiful sand, wave and valley ball beach,and a lot of activities, conference, meeting, weding, party, celebration etc.all staff very nice:)even souvenior so nice and cheap"
RJRE,Maryland,Aug 2015,"Nice beach, but we found in the early part of the day, the water was way out, and the beach was full of seaweed and shells etc. When the tide came in though, it was wonderful. Water was clean, clear and calm, so good for children to swim too."
Liz J,"Melville, Australia",Jul 2015,Nice beach to walk along and swim. Lots of nice restaurants and a botanical park close by. There is quite a bit of rubbish on the beach which I thought would have been cleaned up every morning but wasn't.
Gian B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,This beach has an amazing walk trail passing many great hotels.We stayed at the Sofitel and enjoyed the walk. The pictures tell the story. 
Unclekiki,9 contributions,Jun 2016,"Nusa dua  beach is absolutely stunning, only downfall is food is more expensive than other places but beside that it's definitely worth checking out"
ch0u60,"Irvine, CA",Jun 2016,Dont want to leave the ocean.....the beach on the property of The Mulia resort has view of balinese temple up high
Ash_Dom,Perth,Jun 2016,At the moment with the huge swell I would recommend just appreciating the beauty from high up on shore. Whilst we were there a couple of people died due to the large waves. I understand this is a once every 10 year phenomenon.
Veronica,"Houston, TX",Jun 2016,"Beautiful beach, but very rough waters. It is very difficult to swim there. Lots of hotels on the beach. It was not very busy for a beautiful beach. It's quite a walk unless you're staying at a nearby hotel. "
bidyut1986insomniac,"Guwahati, India",May 2016,"good for water sports.peaceful location.not good for bathing..food is ok, a bit expensive. water is clear."
Rydog82,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"If you just want a chilled beach lined with resorts then this is your thing. There isn't really much of a path to go biking on, but you can walk on the path for a bit but it ends quite abruptly which is a bummer."
davudsons,sydney,Jun 2016,"Nusa Dua has clean white sand, clear water and a level sea bed which is fairly shallow without being unswimable.  The beach is well kept and has a few vendors without it becomming a nuisance. ..just a welcome distraction from time to time. I would certainly say that it is one of the nicest swimming beaches in a tourist area on Bali."
PFCampbell72,3 contributions,Jun 2016,Spacious family room. Very helpful check in staff for our complicated check in. So impressed by Sebastian and crew re food options and service.  Breakfast is the bomb  
Rawan S,10 contributions,Apr 2016,"The beach and the neighborhood was terrible, really overrated, not a very friendly neighborhood to walk at night. The beach wasn't clean at all.  "
Edwin F,"Puebla, Mexico",Jun 2016,"Beautiful beach, quiet, clean, no sellers there.Sea water is warm and clear and sand is smooth and white... This is a paradise!I really want to come back here"
Daniel A,"Beijing, China",Sep 2015,"Besides crystal clear waters, clean sand, excellent beach weather, ladies selling their homemade wares, not many people crowding you in the fairly empty sands, there are tourist police everywhere and they are also very friendly. I walked up to one and asked why there is a need for security and he said simply to keep you safe. One could not ask for more in a beach than all that I have mentioned and the added security. Go out and enjoy your fun in the sun and feel secure doing so."
Bhaskar Kumar,"New Delhi, India",Mar 2016,"Very neat & clean beach, perfect destination to enjoy in all respect, happening place with scenic beauty  "
Amelia_hasjim,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Love this beach so much as it is very clean, have a white sands and good facility.The location is close with the water blow that happening."
Chi11i_Concarne,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"The beach is great to relax as the breeze in the afternoon kicks in.  There is a blow hole you can walk to and get some nice photos.  The only detractor but unavoidable is that there is rubbish in the water.  This seems to be in any beach though, not just linked to Nusa dua.  The same goes for Kuta.I hope Indonesia can find a solution to this problem.  It's such a shame to see so much plastic in the ocean."
MelbourneWriter,Melbourne,Jun 2016,"Abnormally high tides in last few days. Beach path washed away just past Bali Collection. Hotels have sand bagged along beachside restaurants. Tides due to new moon and planet alignment are always higher this time of year, but this is not normal. Staff in hotels, beach front moved very fast and cleanup was efficient and thorough. Perfectly safe and still able to walk on most beaches. "
Christine A,1 contribution,Jun 2016,"Next time when i go to bali again, i will visit nusa dua bali. Great beach, good view and i love it. "
Frank D,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"the Nysa dual beaches near grand Hyatt were clean and the sand white and sandy but the waves were incredible. The days we spent there there were king tides so in some locations further along than grand Hyatt got a lot of litter washed up after the high tides.Much to the credit of the Hyatt staff, once high tide is over, they are there cleaning up sea weed and other litter washed up."
franky_windy,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,The beach very nice with a very beautiful view. But there is alot of rubish in the water.but over all i like it better than kuta beach...
Tk4490,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jun 2016,"Here is a nice place all hotels covered and nice view its not a place good for swim but for photo shoot its nice place, its a long beach"
artp777,"Trnava, Slovakia",Jun 2016,"Beatiful beach with many hotels, good food in this area. We were visit on june 2016 and weather was nice."
kathy_rodgers,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,The pale sand beach is very clean and quiet and a nice place to walk. The ocean is sonetimes too rough to swim in all areas.
Ralameel,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2016,"The topic says it all, this beach has one of the best sunset views ive witnessed, but unfortunately you don't get to swim due to dangerous waves. However it is fairly safe since lifeguards are all over the beach during day time (preventing drunks from killing themselves lol). I enjoyed my day walks there. "
eunicelu,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jul 2015,"Really nice, beautiful, relaxing beach. Romantic for couples. We really enjoyed it, not too crowded and delicate sands, perfect for walking."
Scottkjs,"Rainham, UK",May 2016,This is a perfect location to enjoy  swim at high tide but be careful of the rocks as the tide goes out. A great beach for a walk to relax and while away the hours
nanditava,Mumbai,Apr 2016,"Long.. clean.. widely stretched beautiful beach.. the water is so clear as you go deep, but from the start its just like any other "
Jeffrey Santoso,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Soft sandy beach with sky blue water, what more can you ask for? It is the perfect destination if you are looking for a tropical beach."
JasonMcClure,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Been to Bali 5 times but this was our first time at Nusa Dua. Beach here is really nice and we had some.fun times jumping the waves, although lost me hat and glasses in the surf. So close to the Kuta action now with the toll way. üòä"
kelaitre,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,"The beach was nice, quiet, not too many people. However waters were crowded with jetskis, water sports activities and speed boats. Waves were also large. Not many swimmers in the water. "
Viral M,"Kathmandu, Nepal",May 2016,"This place is 1 of the best places that I have ever been to! Very very scenic beach, clear water and beautiful sky.. many of the 5 star hotels are located here & they rent the beach beds for the day. After an early morning visit to Pandawa and/or Greger beach, just keep the rest of the day relaxing at Nusa dua beach. Apart from the scenic views, you can also enjoy in the swimming pools and order food and drinks beach side! They have very good showers & changing facilities so please don't hesitate spending time in the water. This beach is very secluded & most of times you feel its like your own private beach and contrary to the popular belief, it is not very expensive to spend the whole day here! This beach is not included in travel packages but I strongly recommend travelers to keep a spare day for this beach and go visit it yourself!"
uknowmj,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"First stop on my trip last time in Bali, never been there before so I kinda curious, riding motorcycle for the first time there and its thrilling for me, the weather was cloudy yet sunny yet cloudy again back and forth haha I can' t believe that it's free to visit this place! Wowww...awesomee..plus its not so many local people and the environment was really taking care by the nice resorts there, so many tourist there..the beach is nicee with the white sand..I think I can just lay down there enjoying the view, reading books or observe and find funny things to see..as simple as that :)"
Deborah77s,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,This is a private beach. Very clean and beautiful. The beach sofa is provided by Mulia resort where we were staying. So comfortable we like to spend hours just lying at the beach.
Mark G,"John O'Groats, UK",May 2016,Nice clean beach thanks to the beach cleaners who work hard after the tide starts to recede only down side to this area is the amount of plastic debris floating in on the tide
Angela R,sydney australia,May 2016,Beautiful warm beach very clean and it was very private. Nothing much bothering you. Local women selling things but no was no 
606clemt,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Jun 2016,The beach is very pretty and clean but the waves are quite big so not ideal for swimming. There is also quite a big incline down to the beach.
Prakash K,9 contributions,Oct 2015,"Though we did not spend more time on this beach as we were staying in a beach property, the Nusa Dua Beach is known for the variety of water sports activity and scuba diving.   Literally a day would seem too short to complete the beach sports activities.  We did not dive here as the waters are known to have currents, hence had to drive down for about  4  hours to a place called Tulamben."
r_rladda,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2015,The part of the beach i visited was very crowded but the water sports options available were amazing.
Barb T,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2016,"the beach is lovely right along the stretch of resorts, there is a path to walk along with restaurants, trees, sun beds, bean bags etc, or walk along the sand. Beach is white, water blue and mostly clean. There are patches where rubbish washes up, but resorts keep their areas clean. It's a great place for kids, when the tide is out, the kids can walk out and explore. Beautiful spot to take sunrise pictures. Wonderful place to sit on beanbag with a cocktail in the evening and enjoy the scenery and breeze, very relaxing."
RabiulH,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2015,Very serene beach. Mostly allocated to luxury hotels around. However free beach is there. Not too many people. Very peaceful. Option is there for watersports.
Paulo Tavares,"Lisbon, Portugal",Nov 2015,"This is a great beach, with calm very warm water. You don't get any waves very often, it's almost like a lake...On the low tide, you can walk a long distance with the water around your knees deep.The sand is very nice and you can have a very pleasant walk along the whole extension of the beach."
Max D,"Montevideo, Uruguay",Jul 2015,"Clear and warm water, white sand, a wide coast and a calm atmosphere is all you can expect from a beach to be your favorite. Nusa Dua is far from the busy streets of Kuta. You can stay in one of its beautiful but costly hotels and stay away from the busy Bali or just go for the day by taxi or hiring a personal driver. Must go when going to Bali. "
silvia-portugal,48 contributions,May 2016,"the water has a good temperature. there are trees to stay in the shadow. there are lots of chais where you can seat.there are beds where you can enjoy a massage. water sports are available like parasailing and others. a lot of cafes, bares and restaurants are there, also. the beach was clean, although there are some plastics in the water.in some places of bali, there is not a public service of collecting the garbage.for that reason, the plastic ends on the ocean and nobody cares about it. if you go to Bali, talk to the local people and tell them that you are worried about this issue."
Carol H,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",May 2016,"the beach was fairly clean when we visited,coarser sand, good for swimming,watersports,loungers out the front of the hotels on the sand,"
Haydz02,"Leppington, Australia",Apr 2016,"Nusa Dua Beach is by far the best we visited in Bali! Much better than Kuta, Seminyak and Dreamland.Nice and clean and not at all crowded. You also don't get bugged by locals trying to sell you stuff like you do at the other beaches listed above.Highly recommended to all!"
Selim T,6 contributions,May 2016,"The  resorts and location are great but the water and the beach aren t any close to white sandy beaches of Maldives, Seychelles or Mediterranean Sea ones"
Roving601758,8 contributions,Jan 2016,Nusa Dua is an ideal place for couples as well as singles who want to just unwind. The beach is beautiful with clear blue waters and Water sports. I would definitely recommend this destination. Looking forward to go back again 
LucasDize,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,"Nice Beach, a little dirty (organic stuff) when we went, but ok.Sandy bottom, that's really good, I guess it was the first beach that we went in Bali that is not filled with rocks..Water blow, just at side of the beach, is a must see."
Sabrology,"Cairo, Egypt",Nov 2015,"It's not a very nice beach, but it has a huge amount of activities do to such as: Parasailing, Ocean bed walking (you wear a helmet and walk on the bottom of the sea like ancient scuba gear), under water scooter, turtle island .. etc) "

samrox5,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,Enjoyed my time at this beach. Calmer than Potato Head. Nice sand & quite clean. Hired sun beds & enjoyed a good breeze & the squirrels provided entertainment. Food/drink available at the restaurant & toilets to.
Anita K,"Dunajska Streda, Slovakia",Apr 2016,"Very nice beach, cleaner than the beaches in Bali. The personal cleans it always. The ocean is amazingly blue, and we liked the low-tide also, when you can walk lot of meters in the ocean."
Jack S,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"I don't get what is the big deal about Nusa Dua and Seminyak beaches. If you are not a surfer, then the beaches are quite dull, not clean and smells!Any Sydney beach tops those beaches."
'Niteshwar K,50 contributions,May 2016,It's clean and maintained. I spend most of my day time at nusa dua Beach. You will find lots of tourists there. It's near to nusa resort. You will find people selling swimsuits and food items there. Kids playing on sand. Awesome view. And lots other water activities.
Lailacs,"Belo Horizonte, MG",May 2016,There are many beachs in bali much more beautiful than thisAnd it's not close to any nice placeIt's kind of isolated Nowhere to go at night except for the mall and the hotels restaurants
Marcus-Aurelius-Pro,"Chippenham, UK",Jun 2015,"The clear water and white sand beaches were really gourgeus. We only went for one day as there is so much to see in Bali, but I would definitely return. We hired a couple of jet ski for a relatively low price compared to other places in Bali"
Jos√© B,Portugal,May 2016,"The beaches in Nusa Dua are very good, they are everything you can expect from a beach.You can enjoy wonderful caf√©s or do a massage while you enjoy the sun. The water is always in a good temperature. You can choose to be on the shadow or on the sun. The only problem i found in Bali is the pollution. The non-touristic areas are full of plastics on the floor (the touristic areas are clean). Those plastics end going to the ocean (in the beach, you will see plastics on the water). If you go to Bali, tell the local people to preserve the ocean, by giving the plastic a proper treatment."
TravelingToast,"Greenville, SC",May 2016,"From where we were (Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa), we could see a volcano on Bali in the distance, and an island across from us (Nusa Penida??).  The water itself was a beautiful blue, but once inside was always full of debris (bits of plans or seaweed or so).  I really wasn't expecting that and was really disappointed.  Sometimes it was so bad you couldn't avoid touching it. No problem if you aren't bothered by that stuff.  Sometimes there was an occasional plastic bag or cup, but I guess that isn't uncommon at other beaches.The atmosphere on the beach was completely unrelaxing for us the first few days. I don't know if the people recognized we were new, but we were asked so frequently about purchasing something that I couldn't get any reading done.  Asking about a massage, purchasing items, jet ski rides, etc!  We read you should always smile and be polite in Balinese culture, but the minute we took time for a nice 'no thank you' they would ask other questions of what we wanted to buy.   There are trees that offered shade, very cool alternative to umbrellas. "
Yash Wadhwa,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2015,"Amazing, clean beaches with no.  Of options for Water Sport... Clear water and good assistance for any kind of water sports "
Debbra O,"Eidsvold, Australia",May 2016,"So much to look at with out the hussel n bussel.Beach can get strong. heavy tides so the scene changes all the time, you can walk on the beach or the paths the join the resorts.Check the Water blower out."
Desniar B,"Depok, Indonesia",May 2016,"its a great view beach, nice for family and play in the beach. each hotel own their areas within their properties"
Jess L,"Arundel, Australia",May 2016,"A beautiful beach, picture perfect. Great for swimming especially if you have children. No big waves. When tides out you can walk in quite a distance. It is directly opposite all the nice hotels such as the Melia and Sofitel. It's not busy like the beaches in places like Kuta."
deemurray,"Gorey, Ireland",May 2016,The water was luke warm the beach was attended all day by staff who were constantly keeping it clean wish I was back there now 
Shayokh,Bangladesh,Nov 2015,"one of the best beaches I have ever seen in the world. Calm, fresh air and a romantic weather with gentle blow of windy air."
ganmeister,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is off a number of luxurious hotels. It is not as commercialized or crowded as other beaches and has nice soft sand with clear clean waters. 
Julia T,7 contributions,May 2016,"The architecture is beautiful. The breakfast spread not as varied but good enough. The beach is fantastic. It has small waves, very clear waters, round-shaped sand that looks like white pepper beads, lots of friendly tiny fishes that swim to the shoreline. There are also those fishes that nibble the dead cells off your body! Plenty of small seashells to collect. Very safe for children under 5. The beach pool is fantastic. It is shady, with sand to replicate a real ocean, shallow enough for the kids to roam safely, and lots of space for guests to swim with their kids. The kids club is simple but they have good activities lined up daily. The bedrooms are clean and comfy. The AC is very cold. The beds and bedding are top notch quality. The bathrooms have very strong water pressure and new fixtures. The toiletries are very complete and generous. It may not be as luxurious as Intercontinental or Grand Hyatt, but it really stands out as a family friendly place to spend with your kids. "
Cristian I,"Arad, Romania",May 2016,"I really enjoyed Nusa Dua Beach. Everything was nice, we received complimentary towels and were able to order cocktails and food at our location. Sun was very strong. If you're white, make sure to use lots of protection! The sea was perfect. All in all, this beach is worthy of your visit."
600nicholasf,"Worthing, UK",Apr 2016,"Uncrowded, no hassle from beach sellers. Some unwanted debris is washed up from around the coast but is cleaned up every day by the hotel beach cleaners"
pandt2013,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,Great at high tide at one end and good at low tide at the other end. Make sure you have a good resort pool to escape to so you can mix it up.
itspriyanka,"Hyderabad, India",May 2016,Its one of the cleaner and well maintained beaches in Bali. Its in the Nusa Dua area where most of the 5 star properties are located. Waves were not rough and it must be good for swimming too. We went before Devdan show so did not get into water though.There are many restaurants around too.
KirOla,Kristiansand,May 2016,"This is a very nice beach with lots of space and sunbeds. Some items floating in the water with the waves, but thats the only negative thing about the beach"
MahoutMal,"Sandringham, Australia",May 2016,Beach look great but water and sand covered in rubbish. Really disappointing. Hotels and local authorities really need to fix this problem or no one will want to go here.
Steve B,6 contributions,May 2016,"Lovely colours of water and the sand is white, although quite grainy. Very pleasant for swimming in the sheltered parts behind the breakers. Loved the kites as well!"
DandrevN,"Brits, South Africa",May 2016,"Very good holiday destination. Focusing on tourists and holiday vibes. There are many hotels in this location, which is a benefit as the shops or centres then collect shoppers from their hotel or close to the hotel for free and drop them off again at the hotel."
HungryFriend,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2016,"The last time we went here, there's been a paving path provided to go through from the parking lot (last time we must turn a bit and walk beside the stalls fnear parking lot).The beach are also cleaner but still, the walk to waterblow is a bit disapponting... There's still many garbage others throw around the green grass... Such a pity... Change your habit please... Do not litter..."
Sandra F,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2016,"Lovely beach .white sands.cleaned by hotel staff all along in front of many 5 star hotels (westin ,luguna, sofitel grand hyatt etc etc..safe to swim .."
Meherul M,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",May 2016,At first day I got upset to watch messy beach with small wave. And next day when I was there I feel like WoW with blue water white sandy beach. It was amazing
charusingh911,"Greater Noida, India",Apr 2016,"We were roaming about in Legion when we bumped into a guy with water sport packages. I bought a package for Jet Skiing, Banana Boat and Parasailing for 150k. He called for a cab that would take us to Nusa Dua where these were to happen. It took us an hour from Kuta to reach there. I ended up having the most fun-filled day ever. The guy from the water sports were kind enough to let me snorkel too!It was an absolutely fun time."
Alinom6,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,We stared at the Nusa dua beach hotel and spa and were very spoilt as the beach was cleaned and raked each morning. In other spots there was a lot of seaweed but still a really nice beach to relax on.
Ladyintheusa,"Javea, Spain",Jan 2016,Its a shame but its a cruise ship sort of place. Just aimed to take your money. Maybe a quiet time would be good but it was busy when we went
Linda W,"Kalamunda, Australia",Apr 2016,"great beach...the day we were there the water was beautiful, lovely and clean, great swimming beach. awesome.....definately must go to this beach."
Daniel H,"Madrid, Spain",May 2016,"Coming from Kuta we found this beach much nicer than the ones in seminyak, is clean in general nd not so crowded"
RLlance,7 contributions,Dec 2015,Very average beach coming from Australia. Especially during low tide with sea weeds showing. Sand was nice enough and great private restaurants and bars on the beach.
Lara C,9 contributions,May 2016,"The beach in Nusa Dua is so much nicer than kuta! Clean, white sand, clean water, clear water, plenty of water sports, surf."
rantati7,"Helsinki, Finland",May 2016,If you just stay in Nusa Dua you haven't seen Bali. And on the other hand seeing Nusa Dua and the beach especially at Grand Bali Hyatt is worth the trek. Beach is really nice at high tide and there are no waves here. But staying alone in Nusa Dua would bore me to death. 
zeitgeist_12,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,We stayed at several different locations and found all the beaches to be very inviting and exciting. Swimming there feels so much safer than the beaches we have in Australia .ie. sharks.We loved the beach the most that was adjacent to the Ayataya Hotel. We will be coming back. 
Rania N,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2016,We stayed there for 9 nights in Inaya outri hotel. Quiet and relaxing location. Bit boring for friends.
Dave M,Sydney,May 2016,access to this breach is from the few resorts face this beach. Depending on tie of day - there cab be strong waves and rips and weaker swimmers should stay close to shore
Nicola G,"Auckland, New Zealand",Apr 2016,"Walk early in the morning on this amazing beach, not crowded, Just super hot! The walk takes you to the Bali collection Shopping centre, you can do a full circle.  You may need to relax in some of the hotels for a drink along the way. But hey when you are in such an awesome setting what if it takes all day!"
Sherpa571767,58 contributions,May 2016,The was by far the best beach for swimming and relaxing. No high waves and clean beach.The beds and umbrellas belong to the high priced hotels but you can ask if you can rent them for one day. We had an umbrella and two beds for 150 000 rupiah ( originally 200 000 rupia) but there is also shade underneath the trees i guess you could also hang out there. The water was not too deep and you can easily swim there. Beeing there in May it was very quit and pleasant.In the evening the plastic started to show up which is a major problem anywhere in Asia.
BalistoChristo,Germany,Feb 2016,"Not as busy as Kuta. No stray dogs and the guys that try to sell you stuff on the beach have to register and are thus limited in number. Nice restaurants nearby. Very nice place to relax. Yet, this place is very touristic so if you are looking for authentic Bali you might be disappointed. "
PokeTraveller,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,"For me, this is the perfect beach area in Bali where many beautiful resorts are. The beach is not noisy and crowded. The water is so blue and sand is white. This is usually used for wedding and beaitiful decoration tho. One of the most beautiful resort is The Westin Resort Nusa Dua, Bali where the white seats on the beach stands."
Alex Pichel,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2016,"I have spent a long weekend at the Grand Hyatt with the family and that beach was kept in perfect shape. Staff kept on cleaning the beach front, especially during low tide. There was no rubbish floating around and as there were no boats allowed either, there was no pollution. You were able to walk for miles and miles and if you wanted could stop at either the various hotels or bars along the beach."
KamilaSpk,11 contributions,May 2016,We stayed in Grand Hyatt Bali which was the best hotel where I've ever been. Nusa Dua is not for party people but if you wanna have an excellent service and relax then you can't be wrong over there.
Natal Surbakti,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Nusa dua beach is now became more and more busy, especially on week end , But its still worth it to visit . The wave is very calm, unlike the one in Semimyak or Kuta .."
georgiap340,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Supposedly the best beach in Bali. Yes it could have been that, with minimal surf but alas that is not the case. Mounds and mounds of rubbish dirty the beach both in the water and on the sand. Yes there are cleaners, quite a few of them actually who sweep the beach about mid morning, creating neat little piles of seaweed mixed with hard rubbish. but then what they end up doing is digging a shallow little hole right there on the shoreline and burying it!!! When the tide comes in, it all gets washed up again. We tried to swim and got sick with various skin conditions. We were very disappointed as the pictures are quite deceiving and do not give a good indication of the amounts of litter in the water. We are beach goers and took this vacation specifically to enjoy Mengiat Beach at Nusa Dua and not to just swim in a hotel pool. Very disappointing and we won't be going back."
Kristine V,"Grimstad, Norway",May 2016,its really lovely beach but with one but - it so sad to see how locals are trashing everywhere - plastic is on the beach and in the water. they have so beautiful nature!
lise275,"Toronto, Canada",May 2016,"The beach looks absolutely beautiful and the waves aren't too big or too strong for swimming. Unfortunately, once you're on the beach, you will see a lot of garbage. Although they clean the beach every day, there always seems to be garbage, sad because the beach is really beautiful. "
travellerathens76,Athens Greece,May 2016,"As there is an offshore reef, the beach is quite safe compared to other Bali beaches, but the currents can be strong sometimes and it gets relatively fast deep, so you only have a few meters to swim at and you have to be very careful especially if you have young children. Furthermore the tide can bring rubbish from the ocean but the beach cleaners are always on duty!  The sand is soft and beautiful with reddish undertones, the water is warm and fairly clear, there are only a few polite hawkers and the place is not overcrowded. The best spot for swimming is in front of Grand Hyatt hotel near the life guard. "
szkut,"Kincumber, Australia",May 2016,There are many parts to Nusa dua beach. Found Some parts can be better than others depending on wind and currents. The beach is ok for a swim but generally with some rubbish in the water. The beach is more know for its huge amount of big resorts rather than the beach itself.
ttoshi2013,"Fujisawa, Japan",May 2016,"We stayed at the Grand Hyatt. From the hotel pool, almost no distance to the beach. In the morning, we could see a beautiful sunrise scene at the beach. I saw the hotel clening team was cleaning-up the beach side. This is the reason why the beach is so beautiful. There was a sign ""No life guard on duty, swiming is at your risk"", I saw a few people were in the see."
Yanuar A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"The beach was clean, with a lot of hot babes around. Walking pavement was well maintained. A lot of security guards could be found in the area, so you will feel safe. Generally a pleasant place to get lazy and laid-back."
Rinat M,"Moscow, Russia",Apr 2016,"Nice beach to swim, waves are not big, comfortable clean bottom. There are some seaweed in the water and on the beach, but not everyday and staff cleans the beach. Convenient if you just want to swim and sunbathe."
42pal,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"My wife and I (74,71) visited Nusa Dua Beach and were attracted to a beach lounge which we sat upon .Within 1 minute we were asked to leave or pay a fee. We left and sat upon a TREE TRUNK and as we were told the property was owned by the Grand Hyatt hotel-so once again we were asked to leave,so we went to the air conditioned Bali Connection shopping centre."
Abby Marcel,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"Stayed just for a short business trip and pushed my self to spare the time for running along the beach. It was nice and safe. Though the crowd is moderate, the running path and its safetiness is satisfying. The best time to start running is at 04.30 PM to 19.00 PM. My starting point was Nikki beach and ended at Hilton hotel."
Karl z,"Rowville, Australia",May 2016,Warm blue crystal clear water. Beware sometimes of strong currents. Go for a walk along nusa dua beach to see some magnificent resorts.
Donna P,"West Hollywood, CA",Jul 2015,Love walking along this beach morning and sunset even after sunset the beachwalks amazing. You can walk into most resorts from the beach especially ones with beachfront bars.
uaremysonshine,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,Nusa Dua is a wonderful safe and relaxed area for a family holiday. We ventured into Seminyak for a day and were quite overwhelmed with how busy and commercial it was. In Nusa Dua we felt completely comfortable to wander along without any hassles. The water & beach in front of Sofitel and alot of the resorts was kept clean and nice for times spent at the beach. Lots of restaurants along the beachfront to try out when wanting to venture outside your resort. 
gtbridge,19 contributions,Apr 2016,"Went for a swim with 6, 8 & 14 year olds. Lovely clear sand. Private beach with our hotel. Nice views left and right. Huge waves outer reef and on shore. Lots of rips. Whitewash knocked kids over. Didn't stay long."
depti70,"Darwin, Australia",May 2016,"I went to this beach today and not a plastic bottle or piece of seaweed in sight.  It was hot, quite unseasonal for first day of May.   As usual when I come here perfect.  Warungs in the neighborhood the best places to eat off the beaten track.  I will eat again and find out the address so I can review.   Best day."
hengkysouisa,"Malang, Indonesia",Apr 2016,"Swim in a clear water in the early morning just perfect. the beach is not crowded, white sand, sun shining. many high end Hotels have their private beach there."
Alessandro R,"Verona, Italy",May 2016,"We been to nusa dua beach for experience water sport, we areived and make us to seat down and talk on prices and activities. We took 2 water sports for 750k rupia, Jetsky and dive(no licence needed). Because we all were at the first experience the dive was about 15minits at maximum 10mt of depth. Jetsky was just mutch fun, you are always followed by someone that make sure you don't exeed in crazy. Compare to the price in europe and Australia  was cheap and we had great fun, bad point of the experience were 2:~long contracting 1 hour about~really dirty water with alot of rubbishAnyway i suggest the experience!!!"
Rajesh S,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,"With young kids here is a secret revealed - beach Nusa Dua which we found when we checked into Westin .. It is one of the safest , quietest because beaches are absolutely private and you are not disturbed by hawkers etc .. You can rent bikes , walk to a very nice shopping area full of nice restaurants and all kind of shops and a Sogo store .. You can fine at more than 20?options by the beach restaurants and bars operated by all the hotels , you can walk out side Nusa Dua estate and enjoy the local flavor .. It is an ideal place for conferences , marriages or just simple vacations and the area is very safe in the night due to police presence all over the place and restricted entry into the estate .. But the beach area has a different character anytime of the day or night and chafes beautifully as the day progresses .. Children are very safe as hardly any outsider is allowed or slips through the security .. It is simply most beautiful among the bestest beaches  in the world with added Indonesian Balinese hospitality which is amazingly rare to find .."
Karim S,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2015,so much money paid to swim with plastic bottles and bags and dirt Vietnam beaches are cleaner just sad
Sue C,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,Be careful swimming in beach as strong undertow. Not busy with tourists. Enjoyed the Bali collection outlet.
Elaine C,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"The club room lounge is very nice lovely breakfast , afternoon teas & best of all cocktails between 5.30pm & 7pmThe staff work so hard to make your stay very special"
Juanita H,"Ballina, Australia",Apr 2016,"I found this beach to be the cleanest   Ive been to in bali, we had alot of fun doing watersports and didnt get hassles to buy anything, could walk along it peacefully. Water wasnt thay deep but nice on a hot day. Lots of places to eat around. Worth checking out!"
jeb1969,"Las Vegas, NV",Apr 2016,"Gorgeous waters, amazing views and rather calm waters make this a great sunning and swimming beach area for families or couples alike.  Stunning views. Hyatt Bali has exclusive rights to much of this beach. "
Talitha M,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",Apr 2016,"Not the best beach, it looks gorgeous and the water isn't too cold. But there's lots of seaweed. There's men that clean it off the beach all day, but it's still there and in the sea itself. Lots of boats and watersports so fun to look at. But you can only swim within the ropes. "
Omaca69,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"Maintained by the staff of the beach front hotels, this beach is safe (due to the offshore reef), clean and quiet compared to Seminyak, Legian & Kuta."
irene t,60 contributions,Jan 2016,"If you looking for some more privacy. You can find in nusa dua. The beach is clean. Because kuta now its so crowed and in my opinion alot of trash now. Nusa dua more quite, suitable to babies and family. You can relax with no worries."
Su G,"Mexico City, Mexico",May 2015,"Really clean and calm beach, yiu can get into the sea, nice views and the best colors of the sea. No noise or garbage."
Cj C,419 contributions,Apr 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is great for activities but not for swimming. To be honest I can only talk for the section of beach out the front of the major hotel area and it's possible there are better parts of the beach, but today I did parasailing over the water and it was full of weeds, algae blooms and rocks. Not ideal for swimming. However there is lots of water sports for cheap prices. And the sun rises are beautiful"
Gwen M,"Charlotte, NC",Apr 2016,"Love this beach! Mainly because you can walk or ride bikes along the whole length with beach on one side- resorts on other. Many of the resorts have awesome various types of seating right on the sand, along with a variety of great restaurants.  They have the usual boating activities too. But we just loved watching the sun rise and relaxing while reading. Only negative was the constant locals trying to sell usual junk or boat rides."
Texonesian,"Dallas, TX",Jul 2015,"This place is not particularly special, when compared to some of the more extraordinarily beautiful beaches in less-known locations all around Indonesia... But for some odd reason, Bali really outstanding at marketing itself as some sort of paradise. If you are high maintenance, then you will probably like it more, because it's not isolated from civilization, and you don't have to challenge yourself in any way. It's not even remotely exotic, and has mostly lost any charm that it may have once had. But it doesn't suck, entirely. It's just very touristy, so if that's your thing - it will make you happy. So if you enjoy traveling to far away places, and only seeing other people from your own country, then this is where you should holiday. It's safe vanilla."
hussainalizadeh,"Pecs, Hungary",Apr 2016,I had a great experience. I just recommend more cleaning of beach. Extremel friendly people. I highly recmmend it to everyone 
Frank R,11 contributions,Apr 2016,Make sure there are plenty people eating in restaurants before you go in as its very quite here. We have been to 4 other restaurants in this are this trip and food was no problem. 
Wilson T,13 contributions,Jan 2016,Nusa Dua was the best beach we visited in Bali. Many small resturaunts and food vendors to please your tastebuds. Lots of shady trees to give you a rest from the heat while you eat or just rest.Just be aware of No swimming on religious and public holidays holidays. 
Zeynep,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Feb 2016,It was very hot there compared ro any other place i had visited. It has a bad compost smell. The beach is average A great place to stay away from all the busy hussle
Suyash Thakur,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",Apr 2016,awesome neighbourhood filled will fantastic hotels and lovely street shopping areas. Try the newly opened Ritz Carlton!!
beckiegirl,Deep Cove Nova Scotia,May 2015,Great beach to walk on and have a swim.  Cleaner than most beaches in Bali. I stayed at the Sheraton Nusa Dua so gained beach access from that location.
LSJ,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Nusa Dua is mainly a private beach with many commercial uses. Most of the water sports are held here which makes it a very touristy place to visit. Unless you have your hotel which gives you the private beach space it would be more enjoyable. A suggestion is to book a hotel along the beach to enjoy this scenic view that no one has.
Jeffrey G,"Carlsbad, CA",Apr 2016,"Cleanest beaches we've been to so far.Manicured daily, no trash. The water is fairly clear and  and very few people trying to sell stuff to you. "
superspyuk,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2016,"It's quite clean, quiet, surrounded by the beautiful resorts. But not quite for surfing I guess, not wave not strong enough."
ajayshah2015,"San Jose, CA",Apr 2016,Loved this beach - more pristine than others in bali. The waves are bigger at the reef for those who like surf compared to the milder kuta beach.  I really enjoyed the waves although care is required. 
terry p,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,I would definitely say that without a doubt Nusa Dua is the cleanest beach in Bali (that we've seen anyway) with beautiful white sandy beaches and very clean ocean water.
shezazle23,103 contributions,Apr 2016,We had heard great things of Nusa Dua beach but was terribly disappointed. Our resort backed onto the beach so was lovely to view from far away. My husband and I went for a walk down the beach and decided to walk up further as there looked to be more people swimming. We had to pretty much dodge the rubbish and seaweed to get out quite deep and into a clear spot for swimming. We lasted about five minutes swimming and decided to get out as the rubbish really did put us off. The beach is a real disgrace and I will not be recommending to anyone :(
WWDreamer,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,The beach was very close to our hotel. Both the beach itself and the water were quite clean. Nice sand yet not at all crowded. 
Byron S,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,"The beach is one of the better ones in Bali.Some parts have a very strong current that can push you along with really knowing it.Still issue with rubbish around the place and in water - some marine life is dodgy.Sand is OK for the area.Admittedly I am from Western Australia - that has some of the best beaches in the world - so I may have high, but simple, standards."
Mohammed A,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2016,"So lovely, an amazing place and would make sure I keep on coming to this super beautiful side of Bali, "
Bridget M,Melbourne,Mar 2016,"The beach is wide here but gives the impression of being dirty, as does the ocean.  I'm not sure if this is really the case or not but I'd definitely not go swimming here."
Inderarani Prem... N,"JHB, South Africa",Mar 2016,We Visited the Factory where Silver is actually made wow do these people have time & total dedication.The Coffee plantation was exciting as some type of  of animal pooh is used to make the rarest coffee lol i refused to taste it bought the Coconut one instead 
radumoldovan,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Apr 2016,"excellent beach, palm trees and banyan tree provide much needed shade, there's a reef nearby, aporx 400 m at sea.watch the low and hight tide."
briangdav,"Stonehouse, Scotland, United Kingdom",Apr 2016,Problems with tides bringing in seaweed and rubbish. Not for swimming as also has problems with sea urchins. 
Melissa A,"Takehara, Japan",Mar 2016,"I didnt get a full view of the beaches.  Aron Bali cettainly made sure we knew where to go and the places to visit while there.  So, I give Aron a 10.  The beaches, not sure... Some in Seminyak seemed much nicer. "
Glenjando,5 contributions,Apr 2016,Definitely worth taking the family to nusa dua Bali collection pica tapas restaurant really enjoyable selection of food 
SonnyCash1,"London, United Kingdom",Apr 2016,"The beech is very relaxing. It loses a star due to the noise and smell of jet skis and motor powered boats.As it is in a bay, the paranomic view is fantastic. The negative of being in a vat is the lack of hypnotic crashing waves. We went in April and there was a history breeze which was magnificent in keeping us cool in 33 degree temperatures.There were only a few vendors who were not too in your face. "
Mark K,"Perth, UK",Apr 2016,"Read reviews about dirty beaches and Too many hawkers, to be fair in any tourist resort you will find both if that's what your looking for, we found the hawkers friendly and a polite no thanks always worked of we didn't want to deal, beaches around our hotel was spotless, further down towards the collection it did have some rubbish coming in with the the tide but nothing that bad to warrant a panic attack, miles of beautiful walks from benoa to the cliffs. "
warren280,"Cobden, Australia",Apr 2016,My wife and I were staying locally and a quick walk had us to the lovely beach. We went in the morning for the sun rise and it was terrific! The beach cleaners were on duty and the place was a place of beauty. We didn't get hassled too much by beach vendors. A massage was available if needed. The cleanest beach I've seen for quite some time.
3clems,"East Maitland, Australia",Apr 2016,The beaches were very beautiful & clean.  Crisp blue water & not freezing cold like in Australia.   The temperature was just right.
Lisa H,"Cairns, Queensland, Australia",Mar 2016,"Lovely beach...very white sand, a lot of resorts front on to this beach so have private areas...lovely to have lunch and watch the world go by"
latinafamily,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"Maybe its because we are from western Australia that I give this beach an average score, to me it is ordinary and not worth the trip unless you are staying there. Sanur beats it hands down."
lovetotravel423,"Emerson, NJ",Apr 2016,Beach was nice and well maintained.We were at The Mulia and just so refreshing and nice watching the sunrise early morning.The water is clear and warm.Love it.
MoshieMo,206 contributions,Apr 2016,This beach is great for young families to swim. Gentle waves ease access. Only tourists. No shade on the beach. Close to restaurants. Beautiful to look at. A swim in your hotel pool would be just as fun.
reneemarbella,"Marbella, Spain",Apr 2016,"The sand is nice and the water temperature is amazing.The only problem we found is that the water was not clean, too many papers and plastic bags"
Gazal P,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"The beach is clean, I ddint see any jellyfish etc though we had been warned bout them. Weddings take place here as well, making it look even more beautiful"
Moha29,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",May 2015,"this is a really beautiful beach , high wave and clean sand . just take a walk around the beach because there are many spots you should visit."
Smart_traveller_russia,"Moscow, Russia",Apr 2016,"If you come to Bali and decided to go on a beach, that's good one in Bali, but still the worth one vs. Maldives and Bahamas. you can try to find ocean clean in a morning (before 11 am, after that it become dirty (with leaves and trees) "
losakos,"Loma Linda, CA",Mar 2016,Came here so my husband could surf. Water was warm and beautiful. I laid on the sand with book and was as happy as could be!
Nim S,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"If your hotel have access to the beach, this is a good place to hang out to avoid too many people. You can swim without bumping with other people but I found that some area needs to be separated with small boat. We access the public beach and a lounge will cost you AUD2.50 but our hotel gave us voucher so we did not pay."
nebojsa J,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Nusa Dua is most preferable less crowded area in Bali, perfect for nice peaceful  relaxing holidays with scent of tropical luxury huge resorts in area especially made for people  who enjoy to spoil them self with high standards services ..."
OnHols5,London,Apr 2016,The water has loads of seaweed and the tide goes in the afternoon. Go to another beach if you can. The sand is rough and the stones can hurt your feet

Christij,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"This is a lovely beach and when we were there which was recently the beach was fairly quiet, but their can be quite a few rips, so you need to be careful of going out too far.  It can be a bit deceptive as it looks so tranquil.   "
The Slow Traveller,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Mar 2016,Loved strolling along the beach in Nusa Dua. The sand doesn't stick like it does in Goa. Clear blue water. And it isn't crowded. 
alchemistress,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"One of the best beaches in Bali to swim in. Various groundskeepers keep the beach pristine and tourists value this by being clean also. The water is beautiful, almost warm with a bit of swell and waves and is an amazing soft turquoise blue. There is a strong under current at dawn and dusk, but the beach is patrolled by lifesavers. "
Alanatmernda01,"Mernda, Australia",Mar 2016,"Water warm and clear around 32 degrees. Relatively calm and extremely enjoyable. Because the waves break about 200 metres out the swell coming into shore are moderate and the water is clear, warm and the sand below is visible. We swam in the ocean on most days and apart from minimal wisps of seaweed the water was free from any type of pollution."
DaveR,"Como, Australia",Apr 2016,"A lovely white sanded beach where you can pay 25,000 for each deckchair with umbrella or sit on the beach. The water is beautiful and clear, do be mindful of a strong curent that pulls along the beach.Take your snorkeling gear as there are lots of fish swimming in the reeds, Nemo was down there too.Keep an eye out for the local fishermen who are in search of squid. Amazing they wear a life jacket and literally float out in the depths for their catch...a different technique.Dont forget your sunscreen,  we also took our own esky full of Bintang with ice to the beach from our villa...saved a few bucks.Not too busy in April or too hot, great time to go to Bali."
kjell m,"Subic, Philippines",Apr 2016,"We went here from Legian and we have hope it had been better. Here is more quiet and the beach is more calm, but it get very fast deep here, so you only have a few meters to swin at"
fran l,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"The beach is nice, very busy atmosphere around the beach.Found the park surroundings had a lot of rubbish laying around"
t_parker400,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Loads rubbish in sea hotel staff do best to clean but keeps washing in , nappies bottles all plastic  we were forever coming out of sea with handfuls of rubbish to put in bins all sea here is like it been all round island same problems"
mkatyan,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Mar 2016,Beach isn't very well maintained. There were lot of weeds in the area. However the sea is shallow here and that was a totally different experience.
TIersHasie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,Nusa Dua beach is a much more prestine beach - but all the beaches South Bali are.This one isn't the best but is the most commercialised and easiest to access. Prices are a bit costly here but the facilities and service is the best. The best restaurants and bars nearby compared to the other beaches south bali which are a lot more idyllic.A little bit more rubbish too due to high traffic.Maybe walk further down to Geger or further South or East for quieter nicer beaches.
amdkr,"Pune, India",Mar 2016,This one is very calm and no waves... its good for walk and relax but for beach fun not so good. Mengiat beach near to this one is better.
Craig O,"Swindon, UK",Feb 2016,"Warm, clear water great for swimming inside the reef and consistent clean waves outside. Surfers dream!  Just not accessible an hour either side of low tide.  "
thuramshan,"Chatswood, Australia",Mar 2016,"We stayed at The Bale Resort and they have a private section on the beach so it was just us and a couple of visitors. Sand is clean and soft, water is super clear. We didn't go to other beaches around (except the Jimbaran which is definitely suitable for dinning ONLY...) so can't compare but this one is really nice."
i_arin,"Noida, India",Jan 2016,Nice relaxing beach for a quite walk or lie down in one of the shades (rented). There are quite a few options of bar on the beach side. the view of the clear water is just amazing.
Bruno R,"Miami, FL",Mar 2016,Definitely a beach to visit with great scenery and a nice walk all along. You can stop to have a drink at any of the hotel on the way too. 
Eli,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Not sure why this is considered one of the best beaches, I agree it's beautiful to see, but the water is full of garbage!! I walked along the beach across several hotels and mostly it's the same. Staff from the hotels constantly clean the beach from seaweed, but the problem is the garbage. Shame!! Apart from this, very quiet place."
AidaBlatPalacios,Singapore,Mar 2016,"Fantastic beach. Cleaner after the Grand Hyatt. Unfortunately you can see how us, humans, are polluting the see with plastic bottles, bags, cups, etc. The cleaners try hard, but there is too much waste in the see coming to shore :("
woojin2016,"Beverly Hills, CA",Feb 2016,"Unlike Kuta or Semynak beach, this place is very quiet to walk, having some thoughts. Smooth white sand is another good things."
Ratna Komala,"Ubud, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"I never get tired with bali beach, always fun and relaxing. I got quite nice beach club it called agendaz. Its nice because they don't have any minimum order to sit there as long as we want. The price was reasonable with nice service. "
WendygAustralia,Australia,Mar 2016,Beautiful clean and inviting when staying in one of the 5 star resorts along the beach. Many small resturaunts and food vendors to please your tastebuds. Lots of shady trees to give you a rest from the heat while you eat or just rest.Just be aware of No swimming on religious and public holidays holidays. 
Glenn C,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2016,"Great beach, but not much around in terms of restaurants, except for some of the hotels which tend to be a bit overpriced."
Shridhar_Jaju,"Yavatmal, India",Mar 2016,"Nusa Dua was the best beach we visited in Bali. It had a line of high end resorts on one side, some excellent restaurants, shopping mall and water sport centers all along the beach.The cleanliness was excellent and the waters looked beautiful and blue. It was calming and peaceful just to be at the beach."
ATWHK,"Oakland, CA",Apr 2015,"Bali has lots of beautiful beaches, but most of them are not suitable for swimming. This is one of the few exceptions. You CAN go swimming there (and not just work on your tan). There are lots of hotels lining the ocean and a shopping mall nearby with great boutiques and excellent restaurants."
LetiBugi,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Low tide, white sands, not too crowded. One of the best beach to spend with kids. Try the bay area of nusa dua beach in the morning."
Seetalusha,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,Beautiful pristine beach. Great for the kids as well. It is definitely a must go place in Nusa Dua. Make sure you indulge in water sports.
Kim W,"North Reading, MA",Mar 2016,"I was on the part of the beach where it's half resort, half public. The water is very clear & was cooler than the water at Jimbaran Beach. White sand, but lots of shell bits so wear flip flops. Very calm waters so it would be great for kids. Definitely need an umbrella as it gets very hot. "
Badr A,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Sep 2015,"at least from the hotel side (The Laguna, a Luxury Collection Resort & Spa, Nusa Dua, Bali, Nusa Dua) the sea is too far from the beach to swim "
Tanya M,"Barcelona, Spain",Mar 2016,"Putrid, rubbish everywhere. Not swimmable at all when it is low tide. Rubbish on the beach and way out into the ocean. It is disgraceful. The resorts clean there own little sections of sand where their guests could sit, but what an awful view. To be fair, i didn't see when the tide was up,could look nicer. But I wouldn't set foot in there either way after seeing it."
ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Feb 2016,"This beach is resort territory. So expect white sands, crystal clear waters, and few fellow beachgoers, save for the occasional family on holiday. Not much in the way of snorkeling, but it's a great place to relax and work on that suntan."
Allen,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"For me, Nusa Dua Beach is the most beautiful beach in Bali. You can take photos from a lot of side. ""Nusa"" means island, and ""dua"" means two. So, ""Nusa Dua"" means two islands, because there is two little islands which sticky with Bali Island. "
wina95,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"Good Beach for relaxing and Quite beach, good for swimming and walking. very recommended this place for relaxing"
Karthik A,19 contributions,Mar 2016,Beach is more for watersport only. The shore is piled with rubbish and oil slicks. Sadly the neighbouring resorts do not bother much to do something about it. Nusa Dua is like a private area but the beach is being left alot to desire for.
jajubabu,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Jan 2016,"It's a beautiful Southern Beach Peninsula in Bali surrounded by luxury resorts. It's also an all inclusive tourist destination with a golf course, convention center,  shopping mall and other facilities. The golden - white sandy beach is safe and sterile. Geger beach is open to public. Enough water sports activities such as parasailing or  available nearby. Balinese massage and spa packages is another attraction. Eat , relax and sleep. It's safe and secure !"
Megan W,4 contributions,Mar 2016,"Lovely beach, not too many tourists or pollution. Clear waters. A little bit of surf. Wear sun cream though ‚òÄÔ∏èüòÖ short walk to heaps of restaurants and Bali collection."
Blibalitrans,"Nusa Dua Peninsula, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"is acctually if you want visit the clean beach,nusa dua is good choice and also we can have a relax there because is also quiet beach,and dont forget also to visit the waterblow inside nusa dua beach."
SK13000,"London, UK",Mar 2016,If your looking for white sand and clear water then this is the beach to visit. It's really quiet too so you can find a nice quiet spot for the whole day without being bothered by people trying to sell you things. There's some cool beach bars along there too where you can buy drinks & food but I would definitely take a picnic with you - we went in a beach bar and the food was expensive and really small portions 
David Germaine D,3 contributions,Mar 2016,Nice to take pictures also at the water blow! :) nice waves. Nice to see if you have a bicycle. Alot of restaurant to see! :)))
Jana J,78 contributions,Feb 2016,Clean and quiet. There are areas where people are playing volleyball but for the most part there are very few people
OzKK,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean, white sand and enjoyable. Up along the beach there are various water sports - parasailing, jet skis, and so on to enjoy also"
swamprat96,"Gosford, Australia",Mar 2016,Its a beautiful setting which the resorts really look after. Water quality is of course an issue- don't open your mouth!
James C,"Welby, Australia",Mar 2016,"Much cleaner than the beach on Gili island off Lombok, but still enough rubbish in the tidal areas on the sand to make me nervous about running on the sand bear footed. This is even on the beach in front of the Ayodya Resort."
olbap1976,"Lanzarote, Spain",Apr 2015,"This place is amazing, surrounded by turquoise water and flanked by an astonishing temple. There is a left hander for surfing but it's very frequented by locals."
thomasgJ5834KW,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2016,"Nice and clean with white water sand, its very nice beach in bali. I have go sun shine there with bitang beer , very lelax"
arunkumar d,"Stanwell, UK",Feb 2016,"Beautiful Beach , good for family, Less crowded , you can try private beach Nusa Dua Beach for more privacy. Nice view. Good to take photos."
Raluca B,"Tel Aviv, Israel",Sep 2015," The best beaches in Bali, great experience, lovely weather, clean water and really nice hotels located on the beach.                                                                    "
dasher007,"Mangalore, India",May 2015,Not great.Some watersport activities were present.The person who was coordinating the para sailing was a low life racist who was treating indians very bad and using slang words.Dint enjoy the place and the people.Avoid.
Yana R,59 contributions,Dec 2015,"Visited the Nusa Dua beach and it is definitely well maintained. It is also heavily guarded; you have to get through the guard booth just to drive into the beach area and there were guards walking around the beach area everywhere. It's a family-friendly beach with numerous accommodation lining up the beach front. We spoke to one of the water-sports personnel at the beach and took the boat to another part of the beach where we did parasailing, flying fish and jetski. It might not seem like so, but prices for the water sports is actually negotiable; depending on your charm level. I wasn't confident controlling the jetski on my own so I requested for a staff to sit behind me as ""backup"" and they readily did. We spent a long time trying out the various water sports and ended up with a great time!"
acaanil09,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,"Nice beach in a quite area. perfect if you are looking to just relax. however, not as happening and lively as you would find in Kuta."
Nkane,"Charlotte, NC",Feb 2016,"I've read a few bad reviews of this beach and while it is not Anguilla, it is beautiful. I spent a full day at this beach and must say that I was surprised at how clean this beach really is. The sand is clean and the water is clean as well. I paid attention to people and watched them throw bottles and garbage right down around them. The good thing is the people who work here take full notice and pick up the garbage right away. There are guys that come and clean as much seaweed out of the water as possible. I really can't complain or have anything negative to say about this beach and would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. "
Ryan O,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2016,"Clean beach, great to relax. It is better to visit in low tide as the beach isn't as rough and you can do snorkelling in the area "
Martyn L,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"Superb! It provides privacy, high quality villas but it's beach is a weakness - long, boring walk - and with such brilliant in-resort facilities who needs a moderate beach anyway??!"
Mal J,"London, United Kingdom",Feb 2016,Nice beach slightly spoiled by people selling their goods but that's what I've come to expect.  Just very annoying when they are so persistent.
Joaniebond,london,Mar 2016,"Really liked Nusa dua, lovely people, nice restaurants........................ Shops nearby within waking distance.Near airport and resorts nice."
Juliek101045,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2016,If you are holidaying with little kids then this is a great beach as very calm bay. Nice sitting watching sunset from a beanbag on the sand. Very sheltered bay. 
Mike M,"Maroochydore, Australia",Mar 2016,"We stayed at the Ayoda hotel for 1 week and it was excellent. The sun beds are right on the beach and the sand is soft and white. The water is crystal clear in the mornings and can be a little cloudy by the afternoon (I would say due to the tides/swell). The beach is kept very clean, and well maintained. There are little to no waves on the beach, which offer amazing swimming, even for the most novice swimmers. Will definitely be back in the not to distant future. "
Anita1211,"New Delhi, India",Mar 2016,Beautiful sea and surroundingsActivities like parasailing...motorboatWater skiing..And relaxingIt's clean and it's not crowded so you can just sit and hear your thoughts...peaceful
Smrjoy,"Izmir, Turkey",Mar 2016,"Nusa dua beach is just for water sports. For surfers this place would be awesome. If you dont want to do water sports, I think you should go to geger beach. "
John W,"Cambridge, Canada",Mar 2016,The beach is beautiful to look at and walk on.  The week we spent there the water was calm everyday and the water was clear and very warm.  Only a few locals out selling their wares and they generally moved on once you said no thank you.
deepti0205,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,"Its a bit quiet beach and very peaceful and cal,. If you are looking for lot of water activity then you will not find that here. But other than that the water and the location is really beautiful. "
PA Deepak,"Visakhapatnam, India",Jan 2016,This is the most pleasant Beaches in Bali Ive ever seen and its so calm .Thes good bars and restaurants surrounding the Pleasant Beach.Ive tried even the Scuba Diving which thrilled me to its Best.This location is second time caller for tourists.
Jimman,63 contributions,Apr 2015,Nusa dua beach was quite big. Very graphical beach was lots of surfers. There were also placea were you could rent a board or even a sup and play around. Plenty of beach bars/cafes to have a cool drink or a snack
Steve C,"Sanur, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is really inviting for a swim. The sand is pure white and the water crystal clear with that amazing tropical blue colour out deep. We went there for the day and wanted to swim at a certain place but were told that as we weren't guests at the adjacent Hotel we were unable to use that section of the Beach. The public section of the Beach is still OK for swimming but a little shallow. Prices are of course higher than in Sanur or Kuta but that's the nature of the place - luxury hotels and great restaurants (with private beaches apparently).
Beth M,"Wellington, New Zealand",Feb 2016,"The beach here was beautiful and good for scuba diving however the surrounding bars and restaurants are more expensive than we found elsewhere - clearly aimed for the richer tourists, in particular the mall across the road. We did enjoy getting away from the noise of Kuta however and enjoyed the quiet peacefulness in wandering around the local area"
DeborahMello,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2016,"Great beach! Best way to enjoy is staying in one of the big resorts as the public areas are just average.Bali Collection is great, specially if you are after a one stop shop."
Love_Life_Sydney,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Sections had flags and life guards patrol. At low tide, in the evenings, it is very shallow and you could swim quite far out. High tide waves was quite strong. Saw people snorkelling. Lots of little places that served local food"
A M,Indonesia,Feb 2016,"Did stay at Westin and visited this beach several times. Overall clean and tidy, not white but fine."
Hsinchu_TaiwanDawa,"Hsinchu, Taiwan",Oct 2015,"I usually go through by the entrance hind the Bali theatre, where really nice start to start the wonderful ocean view and sidewalk along 5 stars hotels around.Very safe and calm beach, Around 10am, ppl get up and ready to swim and read, its enjoy place and quiet. Go further you can walk to a huge worrier status park, lush and clean park, a rock wrote in Chinese latter but cant understand. I had a great memories at Nusa Dua beach, don''t forget to bring hat and sun scream if you wanna walk through to Tanjung Benoa.(it's workable and acceptable) Hot Bali!!"
Loveatfoodsight,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2016,"Its a perfect place to sit back, relax and unwind. The beach is nice and clean and the water is warm with gentle currents. Perfect for taking a dip. You can also try beach kayaking which is fun. If you are tired, just rent out a beach mat and relax under the sky. Eateries around the place can be quite expensive so carry refreshments and your Bintang from stores outside the beach. Also, try to visit the Nusa Dua Garden of Hope which is just next to the beach."
Chris H,ÊòÜÂ±±Â∏Ç,Jan 2016,"not so many people. very clean water for swimming. the hotels there were quite good, i just love to stay there for two or three hour reading a book!!"
Erica C,"Hobart, Australia",Jul 2015,It's probably the most beautiful beach in Bali but unfortunately not my style because EVERYTHING is Western. Why travel to Bali if you want it to look and feel like the Gold Coast?It's also a loooonnngg way from Seminyak where all the best restaurants are.
jheather,brighton,Feb 2016,"very nice beach, wide and sandy, clean beach, especially liked the trees so you could sit in the shade. less rubbish in teh water than on a west coast."
Florence H,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Dec 2015,"We were there in Dec 2015.  Wished we had allocated more time to this beach.  Our hotel was not sea facing but provided shuttle service to an area of this beach which has been partitioned off for selected hotels.The beach was clean with an amazing variety of seaweed.  I have never seen so many kinds of seaweed within the same beach!As this beach is a private one, it was well maintained.   The kids had a great time.Will be back for sure."
Nikki C,"Williamstown, Australia",Feb 2016,"Lovely clean beach, but look out for sea urchins. Happy that the locals selling on the beach seemed to be monitored. Didn't feel hassle.  "
SigitaPP,"Riga, Latvia",Dec 2015,"The beaches are cleaned by the hotels, so they are really well kept. The best in Bali! Very long (at least 2 km) nice walking promenade-path by the ocean- especially at night!"
Genevieve P,"Kingston, Canada",Feb 2016,"We were so disappointed, shocked and in disbelief every time we would go to any beaches in Bali until we discovered Nusa Dua! This is the only beach where you see staff cleaning the beaches from debris, pollution and vegetation. This is the only area where we went swimming in the ocean. No plastic and other rubbish floating all over or washed up on shore. Mid to high end hotels on this beach or a enjoy for the day by entering beach at public access, rent a chair, food and beverage also available and most hotel resort restaurants are open to the public also..We were told by many that the reason the most beaches are so polluted is due to raining season washing all garbage into ocean...ok...maybe they should learn to discard plastic and glass properly so that it is not all over the place and would not get all washed down during rainy season..??"
Marcoregotz,"Zurich, Switzerland",Feb 2016," I checked in at the Mulias on the 11th Feb for a 3 nights stay. I booked through Leading Hotels of the World (LHW). The day I was to check in I sent an email to the hotel requesting a smoking room. I was confused to be informed that, by Indonesian law, no smoking was allowed on the property of any hotel (I have been staying in several hotel and resort properties both in Jakarta and Bali which all offered abundant accommodations for smokers in all outdoor areas, including private balcony's and terraces.). Additionally, no mention of their property being smoke-free was listed on their LHW page at the time of my bookingFurthermore, the duty manager, Mr. Falimra Kalmi, advised me that their resort was the only 6 star property in Indonesia, regardless of the fact that no hotel can be awarded more than five stars.   This '6 star' property was mostly decorated with obviously artificial flowers both in the room as well as public spaces.  Everywhere I turned there was signage warning guests of which activities were forbidden. While it's common hotel courtesy to be excused from a contract if an arriving guest does not find the property to be of his expectations, the duty manager absolutely refused to give any type of refund at all whatsoever. By the second day my loathing of this property made it impossible to stay anylonger, so I cut my losses and left."
baghdadpilgrim,"Grantham, UK",Feb 2016,"The beach was clean, the sea was warm and clear. Not too many vendors trying to sell their wares. Plenty too keep your attention if you enjoy watching the activities happening in the sea, plenty of watersports happening all around. Definitely worth a visit"
Malcolm B,"Carlisle, UK",Feb 2016,"A beautiful white sanded (when dry) beach, quite long and foes have private areas for some of the more swanky hotels.  There are public toilets that are quite basic but kept very clean and tidy and a number of restaurants to eat at - the food is good and quite reasonably priced. The beach is quite popular with surfers as there are some good sized waves (should I call them breakers?), but for us, the beach was great for little romantic walks."
MB1954,"Cape Town, South Africa",Feb 2016,"As most of the beaches in the Nusa Dua area are ""connected"" to a hotel or resort, they are kept very clean and tidy."
Savmck,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Feb 2016,What a surprise.   Lovely stunning clean beach.   Private and your not getting hassled by vendors.  One of the nicest beach I've been to outside Australia 
Misiscarter,"Toodyay, Australia",Feb 2016,"Beach is clean and sand is raked every morning great for standup boarding, swimming, surfing, snorkelling, sun bathing, path way along the beach for bike riding "
SedaEg,Istanbul,Aug 2015,"Beach is nice. However with the tide, when the sea pulls out, it turns into an extremely rocky area which isn't the nicest experience. Compared to Kuta or Seminyak on the other side of the island, Nusa Dua is quieter and much more private."
Linda B,"Cherrybrook, Australia",Feb 2016,"A pleasant beach with many 5 star private beach clubs. Not too many locals harassing you to buy their goods or massages. Nice, well priced restaurant nearby for lunch. I preferred to stay in the resort and taken advantage of my private pool"
Wanderer629587,3 contributions,Feb 2016,"Lovely beach,  very calm. The water is mostly clear. A bit of seaweed bit otherwise okay. The water was a bit too warm for my liking! "
msprenger001,"Beijing, China",Feb 2016,"Unforgettable - blue sky, flower petals forming a path, a light breeze - the perfect setting for a beach wedding - and unlike other Bali beaches completely solitary"
Aprila070,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2016,"We decided the night prior to head to the beach for a sun rise if the weather cleared.Awake at 550am, still dark. By the time we left the hotel at 6am it was a short 10 min walk to the beach from the Marriott.We sat on some lounges and watched the crowd gather - about 30 people ended up on the beach watching the red/pink sun rise over the ocean.We walked the beach without to many hassles and enjoyed stretching our legs before the heat of the day set in.The beach was lovely and clean and the walk back enjoyable."
Kat S,"Sheffield, UK",Feb 2016,Long enough for an hour stroll. At high tide deep enough for a swimm. You do not have to pay for entrance. Within walking distance of bali colection
Verina Smith,"London, UK",Feb 2016,"To enter this beach need to come to BTDC first. Some restaurant in front of the beach, kids friendly, i saw some people doing yoga aswell in the garder facing the beach. Also they have a big garden to walk and joging, so many local brought their pets for plays. Nice and you can also see the water blow. I love the spot."
Mass22,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2015,"Very nice beach, it has its flaws. Its has a lot of coral and sea weed so might put some people off. Sea shoes are recommended and be careful if venturing out on the coral during low tide. loads of tiny pools to discover and play with but i did see evil looking slug that screamed ""im poisonous"" and Sea snake jamming among some sea weed. Might i add i did not go back to explore the corals after that day. The beach is clean. We stayed at one of the hotels and the beach are cleaned by the staff."
TonyandDana I,"Wilson, NC",Feb 2016,"Awesome, quiet, beautiful beaches.  You can sit all day under an umbrella taking in the gorgeous view.  We will definitely return. "
Tanya-Maree,"Waiheke Island, New Zealand",Aug 2015,This is a wonderful place to enjoy a stroll on the beach or to participate in all the different watersports.  I would recommend getting a package as you get to try all the activities.  Well worth paying for a tour and getting them to take you there and back including the activities.
Caio B,17 contributions,Feb 2016,The walking along the beach and resorts is really nice and enjoyable.You can have a cocktail or have a lunch/dinner even if you are not staying in the resorts.There are plenty of water sports.Our favorite area in Bali.
Karan A,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,"We did Water Sports at Nusa dua beach and I guess one of the hot destination for water sports. It was a bit crowded but we had our own fun. It is big enough to give you your personal space. The water is clear. We did Parasailing, Fish Fly, Jet ski, Banana Boat, Turtle Island and Scuba dive.The beach wasn‚Äôt as clean where we did Parasailing. But it offered picturesque view when we did Banana boat and Jet ski. While doing Jet ski I realised the sea was not really as crowded as it appeared earlier. It gave a personal beach kind of feeling!Ride to Turtle island was fun! I did my first Scuba and it was worth every second there deep under water. The water was not as clear, and the instructor told us that it is more clear in morning hours and we visited in noon time. But the feeling of underwater, spotting corals, fishes, looking at the floor of the sea and swimming like sea, Lord Ganesha idol is beyond comprehension! One of the best of the times we had!"
RavinSA,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2016,"By far one of the most picturesque beaches I have ever seen. like a never-ending pool, perfect for kinds and lazy rolling about."
Greti,"Orebro, Sweden",Feb 2016,Really nice beach with clean white sand. Our hotel has a private area there so we could really enjoy our time here. Water could be cleaner (lot of algea) but local people really do their best. 
Pierre S,"Vancouver, Canada",Jan 2016,Lovely beach both in the daytime and evening because of the promenade that links the various hotels.  Lots of variety in terms of restaurants; also includes pleasant open-air shopping area that is not overly posh (and priced acordinly...).
Ursh,"Ettalong Beach, Australia",Feb 2016,"The beach was a great surprise. We stayed previously at Seminyak and the beach was not at all nice. The beach here had white sand, no rubbish and also not a lot of hawkers. A few water activities available, however our kids were happy with the pool and we also visited in rainy season so wasn't a lot of beach time weather. Our resort had a gorgeous setting on sand for drinks at sunset. Look forward to stopping here again. "
dado,"Doha, Qatar",Feb 2016,This place is amazing. We went there few mins before sunset and had dinner in a nice restaurant called aroma (already submitted review if u want to check it ) The beach was a bit crowded but that is normal as it's so nice water is warm and nice waves !! Was super romantic as you can see in the photos RECOMMENDED 
Natalija R,"Guangzhou, China",Feb 2016,"After we saw dirty beach of Seminyang (due to low tide and rainy season) this beach was a piece of cake! Clean beach with white sand, not a lot of people, amazing view, blue water. Loved it! BUT still  the water was not transparent and had sea weed in water and on beach, so i suggest come to Bali in summer, cuz during raining season (winter) water is pretty dirty everywhere, enjoy your holidays. "
Ffang3056,"South Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,Stayed at the Ritz Carlton. Beautiful hotel with extremely attentive staff and faultless service. Sadly a little isolated for my liking and far too many mosquitos. Although they fogged every day the mosquitos were not deterred.
Xavier G,"Horsham, UK",Jan 2016,"One of the best beaches in Bali and no wonder why the Island's 5 star hotels tend to be based here. The waters are calm, the beaches are clean and clear. "
jola76,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"if want to find a quiet beach, clean, not too crowded and it's free (although surrounded by luxury hotels), this is the right place. nearby are many interesting view include Arjuna statues, and water blow. to the location even this is not too difficult, and many directions there."
Jaybac,"Surat, Australia",Feb 2016,The beach was very clean & well guarded. It was indeed very safe to take a dip or swim with this ur kids.
Shakeel Yoonus,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Feb 2016,"we came here only for the water sports. we tried flyfish, doughnut, banana boat and adventure parasailing. a good fun filled day."
Genuinereviewer,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,"Clean and beautiful beach with a marvelous view of the peninsula. Very few salespeople here. Would be lovely for families, couples, surfers and the like. "
Joey L,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"We stayed in BALI six day , Nusa Dua Benoa beach is a very long beautiful and quiet clean beach , suitable to swim and sun bath .A lots of fancy resort around the beach , There is some seafood restaurant and bars . Also you will see many women who wear traditional BALI dress , they provide outdoor massage service,  Grab a cocktail , ready a good book , enjoy the day !! Recommendation : Pick a day , hire a bike from your resort cycling through the beach , explore different angle of the beach , beautiful seashore ."
devis0n,"Yeosu, South Korea",Feb 2016,"I think this beach is comparable to Sanur beaches.  Quiet surf, nice sand, view and a lot less quieter than the beaches of Seminyak and especially Kuta.  A great place for romantic lounging with a couple or to spend family time.  There are not a lot facilities around except for the odd hotel restaurant though."
KarolaRS,"7,069 contributions",Jun 2015,"Long white beaches, good restaurants, drinks equal in earshot. Here you can relax properly. Prices for the chairs  very low compared to what was otherwise offered elsewhere. "
DanyMark88,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"Pristine beach, good for water sports as the sea is very calm in this part of Bali.  Surrounded by many 4/5 star resorts. Not much else to do here if not staying in one of the big hotels."
Farrah F,"Concord, CA",Jan 2016,"Came here to watch the sunrise on our last day ""team no sleep"" the sand is soft the beach is long. There are chairs along you can sit. It's a nice beach"
Andrew C,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2015,"Twice I have been to Nusa Dua,  Both times it is filled with seaweed.  Walked along the beach during low tide once and it is even worse.  If you come to Nusa Dua, don't come for the beach."
Suranjeen,"Ranchi, India",Jan 2016,"This beach is clean and private. The water is clear, you could actually see your penny fall and dive to get it."
Evelyn V,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"We stayed at Westin Nusadua in December, which directly connected to the beach. It was quiet and clean, with security guards everywhere. Definitely a good venue to jog in the morning."
Libor79,"Prague, Czech Republic",Feb 2016,"This beach is quite nice stretch of white sand, that is relatively clean and maintained, especially if you walk around the bigger and luxurious hotels. A promenade lines the shore , passing hotels of mainly 4-5* rating, allowing you to see the gardens, pools and the architecture of each hotel. This promenade, especially heading south of hotel Bali Tropic offers nice walks, good jogs or bike rides. Heading north of the hotel, after about 1,5km, you will pass through few dirty and unkept areas, which ruins the walk. There are a few downsides of this otherwise lovely beach-Firstly it is the constant noise of water scooters and fast boats, that spoil the tranquility of this place. We visited in February '16 and the hotels and beaches were quite empty, which suited us. However I can imagine this place getting very busy and even noisier in the peak periods and turning this lovely area into sea of bodies fighting for the beach and sun lounger. The second downside is the difference in tide of these shallow waters . In high tide, the swimming areas (you can only swim in small sections marked by the buoys) is ok but never too deep, which makes is ideal for small children. Also the currents are very weak, making the beach quite safe for non swimmers. During the low tide, in many places you can barely swim- the water level is up to the waistline. Also in low tide you often swim through the algae, which is not pleasant at all. The hotels are trying to clean the beach of plastic, algae and other debris, but sometimes their efforts are not enough. In general, it is a lovely stretch of beach worth visiting and perhaps staying in one of many luxury hotels. "
helhng,"Taipei, Taiwan",Feb 2016,"We went to the beach from bebek bengil, and there were some trash and rocky sands in the water. The public beach was kid friendly without surfers. Its a beach for kids but definately not the best one. I assume the private beach of nusa dua is much better than this. "
Jayaprakash N,Bangalore,Jan 2016,"Nusa dua means 2 islands. Literal meaning is Nusa is Island and Dua mean two in Malay.Its a enclave of  large 5-star resorts / Hotels. Just found one huge Hospital in the vicinity.It caters golf resorts, fine dining and R&R. Surfing and diving are popular activities for more active visitors to this beach destination.  It has an  array of spas, galleries and boutiques await those who prefer less exertion. Local Barong performances can be admired at Batubulan"
AnniUK,21 contributions,Dec 2015,Beautiful clean beaches not like in Kuta where I found the beach very dirty Nusa Dua beach great for any age and water very clean 
Helen Z,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"Very clean, beautiful surrounding as most resorts had there own beach where you could lay back on the lounge and order  food and drinks with the staff"
anks_baaz,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2015,Clear waters for scuba and snorkeling male sure your bargain for the gearnice place to relax and click some great pictures
aquick2016,"Altrincham, UK",Jan 2016,"Uncluttered, relaxing,breathtakingly beautiful .With comfortable sun loungers and attentive staff I have yet to find a beach to better it."
LEVAN TAVADZE,"Beijing, China",Feb 2016,"It's our 6th visit to this hotel. Food and service quality the best. Only smiling faces around. Very good Italian restaurant, Japanese restaurant Hamabe and international restaurant IKAN also are very nice choice for dinner. quit big swimming pool for adults and separated small kids pool with the roof. Food quality in the hotel is much better than in Bali collection. "
YusufKS,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Nusa Dua area has always been known as one of the exclusive and elite area in Bali. Most of this beaches have been linked directly to luxury hotels that have a lot of nice facilities. But that does not mean only people who stay in luxury hotels that can enjoy the beauty of Nusa Dua. There is a path that can be passed by general people to visit and enjoy the beauty of Nusa Dua.It's very well maintained, that's why this beach is so clean and very beautiful. Here I have found one of paradises in Bali, I called the place : Blue Heaven.p.s. Check my Flickr to see the photo of Blue Heaven (in colors, not black&white), photos of Bali and many more! I wrote my Flickr link on my TripAdvisor profile, just check it out if you interested :)"
bimbo049,Philippines,Nov 2015,"nusa dua beach is best for family with childrens, i think the water is more cleaner and safer to swim than kuta beach,not busy beach unlike kuta beach you can have more privacy to swim,many high end hotels and restaurant..."
Anna C,14 contributions,Feb 2016,We had a wonderful stay - the beach outside our hotel was kept wonderfully clean and the water was lovely to swim in.
Mel D,"Great Malvern, UK",Jun 2015,Beautiful well kept place the sea was warm and a daily walk  along the beach brought you to little bars and places to eat - safe and idyllic.
RPM,"Dharamsala, India",Feb 2016,It's a nice family beach that is pebbled with eateries. The quality of food and drinks offered is not worth the money (unless you are only buying the old Bintang)
kel668,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jan 2016,Nusa beach is a more relaxed area as compared to kuta. U find yourself hidden in paradise. The waves are calm...good to explore
Adhiegunadharma,Bandung,Feb 2016,"Really enjoy swimming in Nusa Dua Beach. We feel having more privacy. Beach was cleaner than Kuta Beach, and in my opinion this beach was more save than the other beaches.Some hotel are located in beachfront, with its beach club. "
jollyjoyce,"Carlisle, UK",Dec 2015,Nice beach area. Touristy but good security at the entrances to the area.Lots of nice hotels with local restaurants close by.
najimudeen,"Melaka, Malaysia",Jan 2016,Nusa Dua beach is very shallow and clam. Can swim for a short distance. The sand is white and clean. Children enjoy making sand castle
Marianna K,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,I loved the scenery every morning while I was having breakfast though. It seemed like those resorts and hotels are not much interested in cleaning their beach sides as they all have good swiming pools?!
futsanglung,"Rotherham, UK",Jan 2016,"lots of the beach is ""owned "" by the hotels that front it and can only be used by their guests. Nice sand but shallow water with not much chance of swimming unless you go out past the coral and that can be a long way"
Norma O,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,The water is crystal clear and it was so cool to swim.  No stingers or issues.  We were lucky enough to be right on the beach at our hotel and it was quiet without harassment of any kind.
skylger,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",Jul 2015,had a great afternoon here on the beach. was nice in the wind and the sun. nicer then some other beaches with much more swell and seeweed
mike s,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2016,"I love this beach...just the road from my villas to beach need improve as for public, local authority need pay attention as the Beach so cool..."
SajUK1,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"Very clean beach, not very busy towards the more expensive hotels We stayed at the Grand Hyatt - own dedicated beach was great - no complaints at all.Traveled in Aug 2014"
Kirk P,"Ashburton, New Zealand",Jan 2016,We hired a bike and biked down the beach. Best way to get around the beach. Lots of nice hotels. People are nice and it is safe. 
Lee h,48 contributions,Jan 2016,Possibly the most quiet beach in Bali. Small waves good for swimming. Lots of locals pestering you about 'water sports'
Nitin H,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2016,It's a nice beach with crystal clear water and white sand. The beach is very safe. There are hardly any waves here. We felt like swimming in the pool. When we went it wasn't crowded. No beach sports here and hence it is quiet. Lot of restaurants in the vicinity. Overall nice beach.
sourabh c,8 contributions,Jan 2016,This place is gr8 for any one looking to explore advantages and love to walk around.You can go shopping in bali collection or move around the beach which is accessible from 3sides.
Natasha K,3 contributions,Jan 2016,Nice and private beach and the sand is clean. We stayed at the Ritz Carlton which had a private beach. It is lovely as there aren't people pushing you to ride jet skis or go parasailing.
Priyansha J,3 contributions,Jan 2016,"Clean, fresh, new, and beautiful.We did not want to come here as we'd heard it's only known for it's resorts/it's for people who are looking to relax. My second day here and I've done so much: shopping, jet skiing, even scuba diving!"
Katrina C,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2016,"Over all the beach is nice. The part where locals go is not as clean as the part where high end hotels are located. I think the problem is that the beach doesn't have enough bins. So people just leave rubbish on the beach which is terrible. Especially when you walk down the little park on peninsular it is littered with cigaret buds, plastics, etc. And again no one cleans the area and no bins around. It's actually quite scandalous to see considering it is called one of the luxury beaches in South Kuta! Also, I personally would like to suggest to the local authorities to ban smoking on the beach and provide dedicated areas for it to stop the problem of the cigaret buds scattered across the beach! And issue fines for people who leave rubbish behind! It will not only provide smoke free beach for the children but also will save the sea from the trash. Bali should do more to tackle the trash issue if they want to meet the European standards.  "
Wilbury878,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"My wife and I were there 20 years ago for our honeymoon. It was wonderful. Just went back in January 2016 and could not believe our eyes. Tourism has destroyed the place. There is no culture left, it is overcrowded and expensive and, worst of all, polluted.Go to Nusa Lembongan instead. It is what Bali was like 20 years ago."
Foxyyy,"Hughesdale, Australia",Jan 2016,"We stayed at the Grand Mirage Nusa Dua 20 years ago, and now the area is overdeveloped and, well, ugly! There is no 'jungle' left, just mile after mile of hotels and restaurants. The watersports operators are greedy and opportunistic and it has lost its relaxing feel. A complete let down, especially the snorkeling.I highly recommend going to Lembongan Island by the public express boat and heading to Captain Bobo's Warung. You can snorkel cheaply and the water is crystal clear and the wildlife abundant. Don't waste your money on the Nusa Dua snorkeling trips, unless you like murky, rough water and being attacked by floating plastic bags."
AElena83,"Lecco, Italy",Jul 2015,very nice beach. not too crowed. the water is really clean. I enjoyed th tide. allow you to walk  a lot into the sea.
Konstantin S,25 contributions,Jan 2016,"Just an average beach, nothing special. Not too clean. Would recommend other beaches like Pantai Pandawa, that is only 10 minutes away and is more attractive. If you are looking for something more remote, with less crowd, then Green Bowl would be more suitable, it's only 15 minutes away from Nusa Dua."
Norine007,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"relaxing beach, full of comfy chairs and gazebos. we visited this beach at the nusa dua resort complex.clean, beautiful with lots of eateries and bars to choose from"
SelinaCheang,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2016,"It was a bit disappointed with the beach. We expected the beach will be a bit more well-maintain since it is some kind like private beach that belongs to the Nusa Dua community but we found out that it has no different with other public beach. We found all sort of rubbish along the bay, food residues, coconut shells, food containers, plastic bags, etc, we don't even dare to go down the water to swim. The only thing that we felt amaze with is a place called ""Water Blow"" , you can see waves colliding onto the rock wall creates a giant splash like the water is ""blowing up"", it was quite an amazing view. Water Blow is located near to Grand Hyatt Hotel. "
Des S,"Grafton, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2016,"Used the beach over a 10 day stay at Ayodya. It is protected by an outside reef, had waves some days but mostly flat and very clear water, no rubbish. beautiful white sand."
funblu16,"New York City, NY",Jan 2016,"This review is for the portion of the beach in front of The Laguna hotel.  The water has a lot of garbage in it b/c of all the boats that come in and out for the various watersport activities.  During low tide, the beach literally turns into swamp land so you can walk out pretty far into the ocean (but beware of sea urchins, wear sandals)!  Was also annoyed by the vendors that constantly walked the beach trying to sell sarongs, hats and tattoos to you - I just wanted to relax on the beach, but constantly had to shoo them away.  Overall,  disappointed with this beach experience, the beaches in the Caribbean (i.e., Bahamas, Virgin Islands, etc.) are MUCH nicer."
Sarvs F,Te Atatu,Jan 2016,A beautifully staged and clean beach for tourists that want to be pampered. Loved the fact that where we settled along the beach the bar served Bintang (not the case at Potato Head üôä). You must purchase to sit at the table or if you arrive early rent the shaded sunbeds. For next to nothing have one of the mamas give you a massage. Beautiful as it is it's quite isolated from the real Bali though.
ZanthAgo,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"my kids love to swim there , clean. nice and relaxing day with beautiful surrounding. good to go there again one day"
shelley M,"Bonnells Bay, Australia",Jan 2016,"So disappointing to see such beautiful beaches with rubbish spoiling the oceans. Beach is so clear and sands are white, picture perfect really until you swim into rubbish and this spoils the experience. I can't understand why there is no one cleaning this up considering all the five star accommodation along this coastline. Maybe some of that money that is being made at these hotels should go back into conservation. "
justscottish04,"Moruya, Australia",Jan 2016,"We loved the beach not far walking distance from the Bali collection there was two little island that you can walk out to and have a look at the cliff edge. We also seen the big iconic statue and the water blow. The day we went the waves weren't wild so didn't get the full experience of the waves sweeping over the rocks and the viewing point. Beautiful scenery!! It was great to go site seeing then we stopped into a hotel and had a beer. The perks of this is you can use their pool to cool down. We at the Pirates bay, you should check that out great experience :).The beach was so clean and water is clear."
marilyntozer,"Devon, UK",Jan 2016,"Walk this stretch most days then stop for a beer. Mostly hotels with outlets in between, nice little shopping outlet at far end."
SusanHsk,"Hillarys, Australia",Oct 2015,Beach is clean and white sand. Didn't see many people swimming though but in Nusa Dua the pools are just as close.
Fearless448788,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"One of the nicest beaches in Bali and we have visited a few. Great beach clubs where you can relax, drink and swim in luxury. "
Nasra_hm,"London, UK",Aug 2015,Beautiful white sand beach with many restaurants to dine at facing the beach. There's so many water activities to take part in. 
Alskis70,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2016,"Beautiful,  peaceful beach with lovely clean sand. Highly recommend. Waves are a good size for people of all ages."
Sunchaser,"Victoria, Australia",Jan 2016,"A little disappointed in all the beaches in Bali. We sure are spoiled in Australia with our beaches. This was nice. Sand a bit scratchy and stoney. Lots of nice pool loungers to sit and relax on. Water very warm, quite clear a bit of rubbish floating about - not bad "
Adridi_yanto,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"No need to spend a lot of money to see this beach. just pay the parking fee, then you can see the beautiful Nusa Dua Beach....enjoy it."

AlejandroMartinez,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"Nusa dua beaches are beautiful, great landscape, beautiful view to the volcano, marine sports, and great people, the only thing It needs is better policies and fines around rubbish, as tourist is our responsibility as well to keep the beaches clean, it is our planet at the end of the day, let's keep it tidy and beautiful "
Adie K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,The Novotel Private beach was clean and well serviced.Only the best times to go is from 8:00am to midday and 3:30pm to 6:00pm as these times the heat isn't at its greatest. Prices are average for that area for both food and drink.
LesleynD,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"Nice, clean and white sand beach. Even after NY fireworks, the beach was swept and clean. Very pleasant compared to the beaches in Legian or Seminyak."
Andy22L,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2016,"Nusa Dua is a public beach; as such, you can expect there to be crowds, beach vendors and litter strewn about. It also felt rather pretentious with the slew of luxury resorts monopolising the area."
skyhoosier,"Naples, FL",Oct 2015,"This is a lovely beach away from the hustle and bustle outside Nusa Dua.  Several resorts in the area, but still remarkably uncrowded."
elliechua,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2015,"Clear waters and soft sand. The beach was quite empty when i was there, making it the perfect place to chill and read a book. "
Manuel S,"Lisbon, Portugal",Dec 2015,"The perfect place for being in beach. White and clean sans and the sea cal, with some good (and safe) waves also."
lovadlina,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"White sand, calm waves, blue sea.. Nusa Dua is a beach where you can relax and enjoy tranquility with your loved ones. There are also some cafes and attractions. The beach itself is free to entry, but there's some private area belongs to nearby resort."
Nalovi,Buenos Aires,Dec 2015,Beautiful crystal warm water... you have both the flat water like a swimming pool or the surf if you go a bit offshore... couldn't be better combination. It is surrounded by resorts life though.
HelloMrBerry,Brisbane ,Jan 2016,"This is a great place to go to if you don't want to be disturbed. We were sad to see rubbish in the sea, though, but not too much in front of the hotels. There was coral also floating in the sea so watch out you don't cut yourself! The Grand Nikko was a good place to stay, also. "
Odilia19,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Better to visit here since it quiet than Kuta. White sand beach and clean water also so many cafes and restaurant with romantic music along the beach
flowiet,45 contributions,Jan 2016,"if you're looking for some peace and quiet, this is the beach for you.  Its very different compared to Kuta or Legian because its more private.  Private luxurious hotels are built along the beach, so its very private.  "
Kaz5001,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2015,"Perfect for a couples holiday to just relax, enjoy local food and entertainment and feel secure in a beautiful location.Water park is a great way to pass the time and happy friendly staff always welcoming.Gorgeous ocean views with peace and tranquility.There are more and more restaurants and beach clubs opening up all the time and the standard and quality is getting better and better as competition grows."
Tanya D,23 contributions,Dec 2015,This beach is beautiful if you don't go in the water.  The beach itself was lined with seaweed.  You had to dredged your way through the seaweed to find sand to stand on.  The water was kind of murky.
Per,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2015,The Nusa Dua beach is hardly swimmable in October and November due to trade winds hitting the island from the east to the west. There will be way to much seaweed (and all kinds of rubbish - plastic and bottles mainly) in the shallow water. The staff of the luxury hotels try their best to keep the seaweed off the beach but can't really keep up. It seems to be a constant battle...Also keep in mind that low tide in any case means no swimming. All in all - Bali just don't have those postcard like pictures of tropical beaches with crystal clear water. If you are seeking that Gili Islands might be a better option.
The_Roaming_Soul,"New Delhi, India",Oct 2015,"after been on the more happening beaches at kuta / legian, if you like to see white sand and blue water, this is the place to be. Its quieter, more classy."
Sonny K,25 contributions,Feb 2015,beautiful scenery for family to relax. Suitable for all age groups as the place offers activities for all
arielchang921,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,It is the best part of beach in bali compared to kuta and it is more peaceful and you can stay under the tree and feel the wind. choose a hotel nearby and enjoy it.
Gavin R,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Jan 2016,With a seemingly never ending line of hotels along Nusa Dua Beach Front there will be a hotel to cater for levels of travellers. From All-inclusive to luxury 5 star resorts the choice is vast. The beachs are very clean and well maintained with high security levels. There seem to be security personal everywhere if you look but not in your face or intrusive at all. 
Lida A,Ukraine,Jan 2016,"Good view to the sea)))At 6 am people clean beachIf you want drink or eat you can do it everywhere)))You can order scooter, a bike. And morning run better at 07:00."
SienLi,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Love Nusa Dua Beach so much.Quiet, Clean, Beautiful Beach. My son like there so much.Choose hotel with the private nusa dua beach."
Rodabeh,Mumbai,Nov 2015,"Less crowded, quiet, clean, nice promenade to walk or cycle as well as places to eat. Most of the hotels in this area have direct beach access hence you can come to the beach from the hotel itself. "
addy_hols,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"If you are looking for a good swim or surf, then this beach is totally avoidable. The bay is full of weeds and no waves whatsoever. However, the esplanade walk along the coast is quite beautiful with hotels lined up on one side and the coastline on the other. "
Miapod12,"Cranbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Love swimming at nusa dua beach... Until I feel the seaweed. Sometimes of year is dirtier than others. Only a few wrappers here and there, not a rubbish dump like other beaches in Bali.Best to swim high tide. During low tide you can only get just past your knees before all the seaweed. The hotels also recommend wearing shoes into the water when swimming as there are sea urchins in the beach.No waves. No hawkers. A very calm beach. Clear water and white sand. "
Haryo_WH,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"I always love this clean private beach, therefore I always stay at Novotel Nusa Dua if I want a clean private beach, compared to other beaches."
TerryV310164,"Chelmsford, UK",Jan 2016,"Nice beach kept very clean by staff from early morning to late .we do have a bar which to be honest is not that good , trying to sell us defrosted ice cream and when they say fresh squeezed juice rubbish they do not even have a juicer just a blender and add that cheap nasty syrup and sugar err then even when I asked for a milk shake made with vanilla ice cream and me watching yes you guessed no ice cream when pointed out this was told ice cream powder more rubbish being feed to me , if you need a drink go next door to Kiki beach better "
cterrantroy,"Chatswood, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is clean, and beautiful to swim in. Also their are heaps of water activities if you desire. And the walkway paths along the shoreline are great for walking or cycling. If you want to chill out on a beach near to the airport this is it. "
metahanindita,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"My daughter really loves this place. She likes to play with sand. The beach itself is very clean, and a nice place to hang out or relax"
John D,3 contributions,Dec 2015,it's a great get away from kuta beach. chill and relaxing. the beach walk is great. the surf is not that good here compared to other parts of bali.
Agman N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"Overall a great beach with many entertainment spot all around, to get maximum experience of the beach, check in to one of the hotel which has private beach. If you just visiting to the area, chill out in The Bay, beach club with many facilities for all ages. You wont realize how time would fly so fast in the area"
L2yap,"Manila, Philippines",Dec 2015,The Good1. A bit more private beach. Few people2. Soft sands3. Strong current so be careful. But fun to play withThe Bad1. Part near water blow is dirty lots of seaweeds. Nobody is cleaning up2. No sunset
Chris-Bj-brisbane,27 contributions,Dec 2015,Lovely beach for Families as its protected from a small out of water reef not far off shore with some surf behind that that the boats can take you out if your keen for a surf. Most of the hotels have netted off the beaches so feels extra safe for tourists. Water is clean and the best bit is they dont allow hundreds of people trying to sell you things. There are only a small number of registered sellers but will not bother you. 
Sim,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,The beach is very nice except that most of the part of the beach has been taken up by private hotels and basically you cannot sit anywhere near their properties... the waves are good for surfing !
Dika Bali tours,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is good for swimming and also good for bigginer surfing .there are so many Restaurants are server western Food and autentic Balinese cousine 
Marc_and_Kim_Z,"Leinfelden-Echterdingen, Germany",Dec 2015,Our hotel had a private section on the east side below the park. Lots of surfers.  Lots to offer from hotels and private vendors.  The vendors on the beach did not hassle us at all.  As soon as we said no thanks they were on their way. 
Missf_85,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,Lovely place for water sports and relaxation. Be sure to bargain with sport vendors. The corn is amazing! 
JohannesAdhi,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"Unfortunately visit Bali at peak season, so every where was crowded, including the Nusa Dua Beach. All 5 stars hotel easy to find here."
1709_Vanessa,"Goa, India",Dec 2015,Spent an evening here. Beach is beautiful.......lots of water sports close by. Had a nice dinner in a one of the man restaurants along the beach side.
76_tulips,"Palm Cove, Australia",Jun 2015,Nice area for a relaxed vacation. It was by no means seedy like Kuta.There are a lot of decent resorts to stay that are suitable for families swell.I will be returning.
Ole,"Stavanger, Norway",Dec 2015,Surf lessons if you want and sunbeds for hotel guests with enoying sellers asking you every minute to buy something only thing missing was the little boy selling gumüòï
Balesh J,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,"This beach is one of the cleanest in Bali. Compared to Kuta which was so crowded with Sood many vendors,this is very peaceful and nice place for a drink or dinner . We were at the Laguna so I think only the residents of the resorts are allowed. "
Irene,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,The water is very clear. The sand is smooth. My children loves to swim just near the shore. Many children playing at that beach. The beach i went to belonged to Novotel Nusa Dua. So it is a private beach. You can order drinks and snacks at the bar too.
Lik-gino,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2015,It is nice bay and you may able to work out and you can see a nice view for Sunrise and  great spot for jogging venue.
GlennDias,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Don't miss visiting the beach if you are staying in Nusa Dua. It is clean and safe, has golden yellow sand, the ocean is shallow with no undercurrents, and there are plenty of small waves for surfing activity further out. There is some seaweed floating in the shallower waters.This is classified as a private beach so you don't have noisy watercraft, loud music, etc. The beach sellers don't hard sell."
Purbaningrum_Sasmita,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,you will never find a beach with best view and nice sand in Bali. tranquil and serene that you find in Nusadua which far away from busy and crowded people. recommended to people that will stay for relax and enjoy the view.
AndiYou,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"The beach, the food, the atmosphere....GREAT! The evening view is beautiful. My entire family enjoyed the view!"
Barry L,"London, UK",Feb 2015,"Very few waves, so dont worry about a surfboard here! The sand is raked clean each morning and the water is some of the cleanest I have seen in Bali."
Ms.PonPon,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"Clean, quiet, great beach to hang.It has nice facilities since we stay by the beach. Easy access from hotel. It has lots of food around it."
CaroleE3,"Portadown, UK",Jan 2015,Very relaxed hotel on an idyllic part of the island. Fine dining but pricy so be careful.  Nice spa area and very tranquil and replaxing. Dining on the beach was particularly nice. 
KhadijaSader,66 contributions,Dec 2015,"This beach is more suitable for relaxing purposes, comparing it to other beaches,  it isn't suitable for swimming"
Pharoline,14 contributions,Dec 2015,The beach was so private and not really crowded. So it was a good beach to relax and enjoy your day. A lot of sofas and massagers too 
Sharon B,"Sanur, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"Nusa Dua is surrounded by upmarket resorts that have swimming pools.  The beaches are great to walk along send are very clean.  If you are going swimming be careful of the strong currents that can be dangerous for the inexperienced swimmer.  Otherwise, a very pleasant location"
Sarah v,8 contributions,Sep 2015,"Quiet, white sandy beach, the coral reef make it not as accessible everywhere.. But the beach is perfect. "
AlexandraZHD,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Dec 2015,"Rated  the beach with 4-stars only because have been to better beaches in Thailand.Dark yellow sand, nice blue water. Suitable for families with children."
989Richard,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,"Visited with family a bout one year ago. Spent two nights there at Nusa Dua. If you like crowded area and massage, this is not the place for you."
ferrob2013,39 contributions,Jan 2015,"Love this place. Easy to access, many hotels nearby, foods are around. This is an interesting place for tourist because it convey many practicality to enjoy your holiday.  "
BoobooChann,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,Came here on 2 Dec 2015 while looking for Water Blow. The sand along this large beach area is white and clean. Calm waters make it nice and cosy to relax. Locals love coming here for the weekend picnic. Very suitable for families and even couples. Quiet and calm environment is what makes it peaceful here.Recommended for honeymoon-goers.Waterblow is about 20-mins walk or 2-min by motorbike.Getting here is about 20mins by motorbike from Kuta/Legian Area.
Mahmoud Mumin,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",Sep 2015,"Started to walk early morning on the beach. It's an amazing experience. Love the place, perfect for honeymooners."
RiccoSpore,Singapore,Dec 2015,"Near Melia Bali hotel the beach and sea is great, clean, well maintained and you can enter the sea easily with shallow waters."
Mil1512,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"We hopped on our moped and took a drive down to Nusa Dua beach - the one located by all of the fancy hotels. We got stopped on the way in by some security guards asking where we were going, we said the beach, they asked the public beach, we said yes, they waved us through no issues. We carried on driving straight, even though there weren't many signs on the complex, but we fortunately came across the public beach. There were loads of mopeds and space to park but if you're in a car it'll be a lot more difficult to find a spot. There were a few restaurants and toilets there and you'd easily be able to walk down to the hotel owned parts of the beach if you wanted to. There were lots of locals there which was great as that's always a good indicator you're in a decent spot. We took a picnic as we weren't sure if there'd be places to eat, but next time I think we'll try one of the restaurants out. The water was gorgeous and clear and the beach really wasn't that crowded. We'll definitely be going again."
poloyul,"Golden Bay, New Zealand",Dec 2015,"Well kept beaches. The only pleasant area in Bali. No vendors, no rubbish as in Kuta. Kuta was littered as a dumpster. Nusa Dua is very well taken care of. "
Shobhit B,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,the beach was largely empty with very few people and food places around. instead there is a beach right outside Sofitel nusa dua which is pretty impressive. and you could chill at the Nikki's club on the beach !
Samosababa,"San Francisco, CA",Dec 2015,At the southern end of Bali Not much seems to be happening at the beach in Nusa Dua other than at the hotels like St Regis. Kuta is where all the action is and Jimbaran has the best sunsets and seafood Restaraunts.  I did not go to Padang Padang but was told that it was prettier  
Fon,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2015,The beach is clean and it has white sand and amazing blue water. A great place to relax and listen to the wave 
John B,"Bangkok, Thailand",Dec 2015,"It is a clean, expansive beach with clean sand and clear water.  There are chairs to rent different places, restaurants, and shops, so a nice place to spend time (aside from the private sections, which would be nice if you were a guest at the related hotel).  It's just not a great place to see coral or fish, so if you are used to the beach in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii it will seem odd there is just grass and very few fish to see, never mind octopus, eels, sea turtles, etc.  Different local people say different things about where a good place to snorkel may be but although it's a nice beach this really isn't it.  The ""very good"" rating here relates to it being so clean and broad, not about what one might see underwater, which is sand and grass, and a small fish here and there."
FleecySqueezyFizzy,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"I remembered, waking up early morning just to catch the sunrise, and we both waiting anxiously by the balcony, and admiring the beauty, simply romantic. The beach is clean, less people. Loving it."
Kuro,Italy,Jul 2015,"The beach was clean and water was good, except for the floating branches and grass on the beach."
TravelnShutterbug,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2015,"The beach is very beautiful a is owned by every property which is lined up one after the other. The beach during low tide looks sad but during the high tide it very beautiful with the reef about 100 meters ahead. We saw people kayaking out there, we did scuba diving just outside the reef and the experience was just awesome. The water was crystal clear with view upto 50 feet and the fishes swam all across and the coral was so beautiful. There are lot of guys who offer the scuba diving and other water sports options. Negotiate with them. We got scuba for 2 people for USD 100. Not bad when they asked us USD100 per person. The walk from one end to the other end on the beach was good and the hotels maintain the beach which breaches their part of the property. "
Andrew R,"Redcliffe, Australia",Dec 2015,A great retreat after the hustle and bustle of Seminyak and Kuta.Less traders to contend with on the beach (very minimal).
Sukiz22,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2015,"Great view. Less people.Great hotel, has Bali collection , very easy to go.Totally recommended this one.Fully recommended."
sunshinecoastgirl,"Maroochydore, Australia",Dec 2015,Nusa Dua south if the craziness of Kuta and Legian  and offers that little haven. Clean beaches with crystal water great surf outstanding accommodation and security. 
Shawn B,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2015,"From kuta, you can catch an uber to nusa dua for about 80k. It's an amazing beach on the south eastern side of Bali. There are plenty of hotels and eateries nearby if you want to stay longer. The beach is very pristine, clean and beautiful, and makes for a good day trip. If your jamming in sites, uluwatu is about half hour drive away."
claireliu2014,"Hong Kong, China",Nov 2015,"It is a nice beach and very close to our hotel, as it is on the east, it is better to go there for the sun rise. "
flappingfootsteps,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"so we arrived at this beach using the scooty that we hired for the day. 30min ride from the main Kuta market. The water here is very clean and crystal clear. Though its a total chaos once you reach the place. Lots of watersports operators around and everyone will try to gain customers. The most important thing to remember here is Haggle!! as much as you can. Thats how it works there. Apart from watersports, one cannot enjoy a  personal time here unlike any other beaches in Bali. Do try Flying Fish and Sea bed walking, thats a must and Para Sailing is good as well as it gives a glimpse of blue green water."
Tanya R,"Depok, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"The view is fenomenal, we love it, it is clean and beautiful. we took a bicycle to look around..You should try to rent the bicycle from your hotel, and try to see different backyard from other hotels."
chris S,"Anaheim, CA",Nov 2015,"Great beach, very quiet, clear water, clean and nice weather. The water feels refreshing, good temperature, warmer than Hawaii, yet still refreshing. "
vallju,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"Nice swimming beach, white sand & has many 4 & 5 star hotels & resturants along the beachside walk-cycleways.Can find beach chairs & umbrellas for hire in front beach Bali Collection end."
joliefolie,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2015,"Nusa Dua beach was beautiful in its own right. The sand at the shore felt like quicksand, sucking you in to the top of your ankles as you walk along the beach. The water is beautiful and there is a nice boardwalk there as well as highly rated hotel, most notably the Melia with its grand female statues. The sand was full of tiny shells and rocks so be careful not to cut your feet."
A2535ATjohnw,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"A nice beach to visit, but if you have transport there are many others in Balii to see, Most hotels at Nusa Dua have their own beach spot, prices are expensive in this part of Bali."
RoshanWick,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Oct 2015,"This area is good for water sports like Jet ski, Seawalker Parasailing, Snorkeling, there are good places in end of the island in Nusa Dua"
Batchy94,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2015,"I stopped here this morning just for a quick look as I am staying in Nusa Dua for a week  in the next few days, so I thought I would come for a look, the beach here is just breathtaking, crystal clear water, nice sand, and rubbish free !!  Very happy with the state of the beach and can't wait to return on the 9th of December :)"
Stend N,"Los Angeles, California, United States",Dec 2015,"We did not stay at this hotel but tried a few things at different hotels along the beach stretch including massages , dining , bars and buffets. We were in Bali for a total of 10 days . We tried 6 spas and at the Nusa Dua spa we hands down received the worst massage experience ever . The lighting was horrible , relaxing music too loud , room was not clean , the two ladies that gave my husband and I massages clearly rushed through the process and didn't care . The lady who did mine got to my head and all she did was scratch !!!!! The oils smelt horrible we had to shower and send our clothes to laundry once we got back to our hotel . We paid for an hour each and totally regretted the experience and wished we had just gone back to Sofitel and paid double the cost like we had done the previous day but get good service !!On the brighter side , their tamarind restaurant by the beach is really good .Management , hopefully you look into this and make some changes to improve the experience of your guests !!"
Chris K,"Beirut, Lebanon",Dec 2015,"great location, clear beach, good for a swim and for relaxation.Great escape and very peaceful.Loved it"
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"The beach is pretty great (sand is like cous cous), for families with an outer reef protecting the beach. The board walk along the beach connects visitors to all the water sport activities, hotels and food outlets, along with other attractions like the ""Water Blow"" and Bias Tuget Temple."
Alex A,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,The second time we have stayed at Nusa Dua Beach. We went solely to rest and relax and did so successfully. Lovely clean sandy beach of about 1 km with a wonderful walk along the beachside path under shade and through the resorts. An easy trip to the airport.
Tariq E,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",Nov 2015,"Everyone loves nusa dua for the watersports they host, word of advice try to haggle with the people offering you the water sports as they often go for a discount if you ask, I got 25% of my batch of activities. Sea walker is a must try and have a camera in handy so you can take some shots!"
Tiziana P,"Palermo, Italy",Dec 2015,"Beautiful and amazing placeIt worth a walk along the path trhought the water front resorts, all next to each other.Nice architectures, beautiful spa spots emerging from nature,  charming musicians, peaceful atmosphere. "
Christine,Singapore,Nov 2015,"Clear waters, clean & soft sandy beach - almost perfect. Very private & quiet although there was a local selling beautiful, overpriced sarongs on the beach. Ideal for young children due to low waves (almost none) compared to seminyak or kuta beach. "
guptadrravi,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2015,"Once of the better beaches of Bali.. a true green water, quite a lengthy one.. very safe to take a dip as well.. the croud seems excellent and offen people enjoy there time privately by going to far places.. the sand is golden and beach services like body massage and spa is available easily.. but there is no food outlet so go stuffed :)"
Charmaine M,"Goa, India",Nov 2015,Worth a visit in if in the Nusa Dua area. Might take a while sometimes for the actual blow depending on the tide. But once it happens it's mind blowing. If you're feeling adventurous & willing to risk getting cut & bruised walk over the rocks and you will get totally blown away!!
Al2go,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,Don't bother visiting Nusa Dua or Bali I don't want to spend my time in a Western Hotel isolated from reality and there is too much developments going on.  The beach when we were there was filthy. Covered in rubbish and raw sewage with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem. I know that we as tourists have a responsibility to do what we can and I hope that most of us do .Having a beer and a feed on the beach is good but again you get hassled . The extra arrival tax that  Australians Pay does not help I feel if they don't like us why come to this Country. We will be looking at other destinations where we are welcome. I do feel sorry for the descent Balinese we have meet over the years but it has changed
aki_freak,"Wellington, New Zealand",Nov 2015,The beach is really clean and with less people to spoil the fun. Its a must visit when in nusa Dua. Although there are not quite a lot of shops around which for me was a turn off. 
Tempotraveller,Bangalore,Nov 2015,The Nusa Dua Beach is very clam and soothing. Not many people around so one has all the time and space to oneself. Ideal time to go to the beach is around 4 pm.
Tristan HM,"Nerja, Spain",Nov 2015,"Came to this beach on several ocassions, great to get some tan, all amenities are there.The beach is not bad the front 100m is low tide with a good selection of smaller sized fish, however once you pass the 100m the waves come into play, after the wave break there is many large fish, sharks, and its mainly rockDownpart, crazy current and if its a wavy day dont try to get into the waves (unless u surf)"
candywho,83 contributions,Aug 2015,We did get a chance to visit the Waterblow attraction by the Nusa Dua Beach. The visit was short since the water wasn't blowing on the waiting area as it was low tide during the morning. But we did get to have a great glimpse of water hitting the rocks and it was just lovely and at the same time scary. Must see just make sure that you get to visit when the water blows onto the rocks for a great photo!
Kerry D,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"This beach is beautiful, very clean, you don't get hassled by sellers every 5 minutes, lots of water sports if you want, call into any of the restaurants along the beach for a meal or a drink, an enjoyable walk along the boardwalk (this is up around the Westin resort)"
B787skipper,"Doha, Qatar",Oct 2015,Like all the beaches in the area this one is no different.. great beach on a aqua blue sea.. gotta love this place.
ridha w,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2015,Many times I went to Nusa Dua Beach. Quite and not many people in here. Beach is very clean and not too deep so it is save for kids.
carpediem176,SF,Nov 2015,"Nice calm waters, but not the clearest. Sand was a bit rocky. We've seen better in Hawaii and Zanzibar. Not too many water activities either. Wouldn't recommend flying here from the states for the beach "
Traveg,"Vadodara, India",Nov 2015,"The beach is having white sand and good shape.. Having all the big resorts on it ,makes this beach perimium..@ 10 km from intl airport..its very upmarket beach.... There is big mall Bali Collection at this beach... Worth exploring while you r at Bali"
Carine P,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,"Bali has so many beaches, this one isn't the prettiest to be honest, but if you are around kuta, or legian, this is a good alternative to run from the crowd. its a nice place just to sit, relax and enjoy a balinese day :)"
heuer101,Zaandam,Nov 2015,Nice and relatively quiet beach with little to no noisy watersports activities. Really a beach to chill & relax
David-Traveller15,"Kuching, Malaysia",Sep 2015,Nusa Dua beach was a clean and relaxing beach at Bali.  There are plenty of Resorts and Hotels along the beach. Their government emphasise in Tourism Industry and they give support to maintain the beach in good condition. Nice for family activities and all the accommodation nearby were Value for Money if you stay at any of it.
Georgie Thomas B,"London, UK",Nov 2015,"We crossed over the bridge toll road on the Denpasar airport road, the charge was 11k for the taxi. As soon as you hit the beach road there is an utter abundance of water related activities that can be hired relatively easily and cheaply from the ubiquitous bananas being dragged by speed boat to the inflatable rafts again being pulled by speed boat, jet ski and parascending, all at reasonable rates.There is no end of different foods available from high end in the hotels down to the B.F.C, yes you guessed it the equivalent of K.F.C but leg for leg, pardon the pound take the B.F.C, the kids loved it. So to reiterate a very nice cheap day out for the family at the beach, you will need your local taxi driver to take you over the bridge, it is defiantly worth while keeping him for the day as he knows all the local vendors and can trade you many activities, budget around 500k to keep him for the day, well that's starting out from our base in Ubud. Enjoy .."
Antipasti79,"Munich, Germany",Nov 2015,"The beach is beautiful, but you have to consider the tides. Water is gone in the morning and as well in evening where. Best time is between 10 AM and 4PM"
Mel C,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"Beautiful beach. Very clean and safe. We are happy to swim, boat or jetski. Lots of fun activities to participate in. "
Remy N,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015," The beach gets better towards Pantai Genger, so keep walking if you started of in the middle of Nusa Dua beach."
Mohsin_AHM,Dhaka,Dec 2014,I visited this place for 4 times in last 3/4 years. Its very clean. It has access from almost all 5 star hotel and resorts. Beach game and sea sports also available.
STEPHEN W,"Rochester, UK",Nov 2015,There is plenty to do here with water activities and sports galore to do from parasailing to jet skiing to getting a glass bottom boat to Turtle Island and a walk along the beach for us older generation.
Ch3rtan,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2015,"Stay at Westin Nusa Dua...lovely hotel, so clean and the room is big. We had a business meeting and Inge was a great events manager."
rushitj,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2015,"This is a quiet beach, it's occupied by a stretch of luxury resorts with a few areas open to public. The water is quite calm, if you're looking for waves this beach isn't for you."
Ankit D,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",Dec 2014,"Lots of water sport actitvities going on, met few locals who were extremely friendly. Just sit by one of the numerous shacks /  restaurants on the beach and have a lazy lunch and a drink. Beach is shallow and you can go to a far distance even if you are not a swimmer."
Pauline N,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"loved a romantic walk along the beach at night, quiet with lights along pathway and highlight waves, and so clean. Grab a gelati and enjoy. Watch out for little crabs though."
Ty Wightman,"Phoenix, AZ",Nov 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is in the gated resort complex, so there are no hawkers, and very few locals. This is a great place to watch the sunrise, and at that time you will also see a few locals catching crabs and gathering seaweed during low tide. There are not really any waves, so do not expect to do any surfing, and I believe most of the beach is private, so unless you are staying at one of the nearby resorts, you may not be able to use the beach. There are many restaurants at the many resorts that line the beach, but they are pricey."
Globetrotter_411,Montreal,Mar 2015,"We were there in march 2005. The water was too cold to swim but we did enjoy nice walks on the beach.You can walk for hours and rest in the bures when in need of shades. Lots of vendors and massages beds, yet prettier and more quiet than Jimbaran or Kuta."
Arthur H,"Mandurah, Australia",Oct 2015,Lovely beach. Mainly used by hotel guests . Great place to.  Relax as there no hawkers and people trying to sell you things. Great eating places in all the many hotels along the beach. Good shopping centre also. Food or accomadation not cheap.
Bostjan355,"Aberdeen, UK",Nov 2015,When the tide is in is blissfully calm fro swimming But suffers from high tides and on low tide THERE IS NO WATER for half a day at a time.... 
jajavalB,"Lampang, Thailand",Nov 2015,"White sand beaches locate among luxury chains of hotels and resorts, quite private and not touristy or overcrowded with tourists, like Kuta beach.this area is resrved for high-end tourists. All facilities are available to indulge your pleasant stay without going to the bustling city , Denpasar . stay here gor peace and calmness. "
lostdipika,Wisconsin,Aug 2015,"This is one outstanding beach, we stayed at the Novotel and the beach was walking , most of the hotels here have a private patch of beach. The sun rises are stunning and the sunsets are super surprising, the sand looks pink and romantic. Perfect place to sua bath and read a book. The hawkers are not allowed, so it is way more peaceful and relaxing"
costin r,"Berlin, Germany",Oct 2015,"We did not stop here, but we walked along it. Seems great, fine sand, crystal clear water. Quite close to Bali Collection and Water Blow. "
Menno0o,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"The beach of Nusa Dua is just perfect; there is know dirt and almost no sellers. If you don't like to walk down the stairs to come to the best beaches of bali, the is Nusa Dua the best solution"
Gary K,"Toowoomba, Australia",Aug 2015,From Seminyak we hired a car and driver for the day to take us to Nusa Dua Beach for some land based snorkelling. Not the best snorkelling available but certainly affordable and great for some relative newbys to snorkelling. The beach itself consists of white sand and was relatively empty so hiring a boat and guide to take us to a reef was easy and inexpensive for a group of five. 
081well2015,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is nice and good for swiming, waves is not big. very good for family and friends. don't forget bring camera of mobile phone to take some pictures.Recommended"
Dayna S,"Phoenix, AZ",Oct 2015,"I have been to many beaches, from Hawaii to many islands in the Caribbean.  The sand is clean and white.  Found it to be a little more corse than I like.  Several water sports available.  My husband renter a paddle board for a great price.  I like the best that there not big wave crashing. I hate fight in big wave, having a hard time coming out of the ocean and having a bathsuit filled with and.  This beach you don't have that problem."
MJ L,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Go for it, chill, swim, dice, snorkel, kids, sun batch, read a good, jog, run, pull up a chair or stool at a beach side bar. Play beach volleyball kick a ball, watch others do that. Enjoy "
retiredtravelagent,"Vancouver, Canada",Jan 2015,Quite surprised as to how average this long flat windy beach was. No feel of paradise .  a flat beach.
Gillilena,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Oct 2015,"Beautiful, uncrowded, safe and clean beach. Great for kids, loads of little play areas, beach volleyball etc.. "
Ssbcaoba,"Prague, Czech Republic",Oct 2015,I spent three days at Nusa Dua Beach! The sand was pearly white and soft and the water warm and translucent. It was calm and just simply a beautiful place
scottbill9,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2015,This is a lovely long beach and perfect for a swim or walk. The nearby temple and blowhole is well worth visiting.
Alexandra,"Los Angeles, CA",Dec 2014,"There are much nicer places in Bali than Nusa Dua in general. If you want a commercial, touristy, with bad food and below average restaurants, then this is for you. The beach is wide and sandy but the tides make it almost un-swimmable, it's too shallow. There are also millions of people."
vicnot,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Can be rocky at low tide. Good for learning to surf.Didn't see any open drains.Peddlars were not pushy.
Jake M,"Caloundra, Australia",Nov 2015,"Great little piece of beach here! Beautiful, quiet, serene and the perfect place to have a few cold ones, nice swim and relax a while! "
timhartland,"Mandurah, Australia",Nov 2015,"Compared to other parts like Kuta this is amazing- really white sand, outer reef and clear water - Bali at best."
Sergey1317,"Moscow, Russia",Oct 2015,"Very good sand, clear water. You just have to follow the information about hihh and low water to be able to swim."
Sandra E,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"Gorgeous beach. Not hassled too much by sellers. Great for swimming, very clean, good for all ages . You can walk a long way out before it gets really deep and has clear water to see to the bottom"
lahlahC77,16 contributions,Oct 2015,Sooo many top notch hotels and resorts and water sports to boot.Great place full of fun. The water is crystal clear and super clean the weather was perfect.Well worth the travel time to get there from staying in Seminyak.
Fabian A,18 contributions,Oct 2015,"This is a nice beach, there are great parts with white sandy beach but the seaweed is a concern.  this is a great place for snorkling and to do some watersports"
Paddy N,Mumbai,Oct 2015,"Wonderful water and sand-the ideal place to hang out with a beer.A world famous ""Buddhist oil massage"" awaits the interested traveller-much sought after but expensive(Rp 150-250000) for a beach massage.It appears that much of the beach front has been taken over by very large premium hotels and resorts,for the purposes of water sports.There is a very small strip available to the public.Due to the ne for transportation,noit many beachwalkers and casual tourists"
Darmawan I,17 contributions,Oct 2015,This beaches are verry well known in others country. Because the beach are very clean.white sandy along nusa dua peninsula. And there are a lots off watersport activities. Such as.snorkling.diving. parasailingWind surfing. Jetsky.banana boat.glass bottom boat . Fishing. Turtle island.and many more.you will enjoy the beautiful sunrice. Also you can see the sunset as well.over view by benoa Harbour. And the beaches are verry fine white sandy.when you lying down to the beach you will feel like in paradise like no other else in the world you will find. Good luck guys
Denis P,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2015,Really nice and clean place. Not too deep so you can swim with children there. However it is hard to get there if you are not guest in any of the Nusa Dua hotels. 
Awf Abdulrahman,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Really you have to go and see the sunset on the nusa Dua beach where restaurants are available. So you can order the grilled seafood and enjoy eating just on the beach specially for the dinar at the time of sunset. 
Handoko T,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"It is great for either runner or jogger as you can find walkway that connect Ayodya Hotel from the South to Club Med in the northern part along the beach. This route is about 7.5 Km vv. It is a pity that the walkway is not that wide, so you have to zig zag occassionaly. It is not 100% private I guess, but not that open to public."
Miranda B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Nice beach which is kept clean. One of the nicer beaches in Bali plus lots of resorts along the beach to stop off and get a refreshment.
Anuranjan S,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2015,This is the beach to be in Bali  if you are looking for some time to relax and unwind away from the busy streets..more so because unlike other beaches...this one is not overcrowded and you can enjoy many water sports activities too !!
Chris C,"Backwell, UK",Oct 2015,"If you're planning on spending your cash on some adrenaline sports this place is ideal. As a beach it's high pressure sell sell petrol fumes and nothing else, so don't go."
Judy F,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2015,If your looking for para sailing or any type of water sports than this beach is for you.   Very popular with tourists and the place to start your adventure to Turtle Island and snorkeling. Fun place!  
Mildrody,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Feb 2015,It's very nice when you go to see sunset or evening. the blue sky is so clear wind too. in near they have place to walking around.
Jayburd78,"Tayport, UK",Sep 2015,"Beautiful beach, nice and clean and very relaxing, few sellers but not too annoying, plus plenty of water sports."
HugoColle,"Evergem, Belgium",Oct 2015,"One of the best beaches in Bali in my opinion. A long sandy beach with possibilities to swim, do watersports, walk, sunbathing.. Theres a long walkpath along that beachside which connects all the big hotels there. A nice and safe way to explore restaurants in neighbouring hotels. There are people who sells the souvenir stuff and other things but they keep within limits and dont bother you too long. Relaxing place.."
tawon26,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"White sand, relaxing beach (in some area), just enjoy beach+sun, need only sunblock, drink, and ...good mood"
su88882015,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"this beach is very good, bring your family  then they will have good fun and want to go back for weekend with family and other fam. also you can visit the beach with picnic lunch boxes so you can save some funds, use your own transport even better,"
Ttuurreekk,"Atlanta, GA",Oct 2015,enjoyed just relaxing on the nice sands of the beach no interruptions. the water was warm and very clear and you could snorkel in the water but I did not so I couldn't give a review on that part
Desislava Z,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Oct 2015,"Unlike Kuta, this beach is very beautiful and clean! The sand and surroundings are great! There are a lot of entertainments on the beach and also some very nice restaurants/bars with pools."
Igor C,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2015,"If you want a nice and relaxing place to swim in Bali this is the place... clean water, nice sandy beaches, lots of bars with good priced food and drinks...Not a party place and no full bogans around screaming, nor annoying people selling stuff in your ear....Also this is the place to do some water sports like Jetski, parasailing and so on..."
rajsreviews,"London, United Kingdom",Oct 2015,Absolutely beautiful beach with hotel resorts lining the coast. It was nice for a sun bathe and a cheeky swim in the sea. The beach is quieter here than in other parts of Bali we visited - probably because it is taken up by resorts. I'd definitely recommend it if you want a relaxing escape.
Andre_C,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Oct 2015,"The water at this beach is so clear and the sand is very nice, relaxing beach and of course safe. a lot resorts nearby where you can try the bar ...lual "
Daniel&Amy,"Rotorua, New Zealand",Oct 2015,"If you're used to the stressful salespeople covering the majority of the tourist beaches in Bali, come to Nusa Dua beach and relax! The beach itself is beautiful, and the water is crystal clear. Swimming would be great for kids as the water isn't too deep and the water is also pretty warm. If you're keen for a day out around the beach there's plenty to do - check out the hope gardens, the agendaz club (free swimming pool), and the Bali collection for food!"
theprincessandqueen,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2015,Nusa Dua Beac is one of the cleaner beaches Bali has to offer. If you are staying at beachfront hotel in Nusa Dua you will most likely have access to a private section of the beach which will be even nicer and well maintained. Nusa Dua is less of a tourist spot and attracts more of a refined crowd. Would recommend if you're not looking for too much bustling activity.
Darnel-HDI,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,The beach Semenanjung Nusa Dua is calm. It is quite nice to walk or run along the beach side either in the morning or before the sun set. There are only small path way as so many hotel built on the beach side. Generally the beach is clean and the environment is well maintained.
David D,12 contributions,Nov 2014,"Nice beach if you like the huge resorts that line up the whole length. Takes away the Balinese quality, I could be a beach on he Medieranean or any other over-touristy beach destination"
CubicletoReef,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,"The beach is picturesque, and there are plenty of restaurants and bars including those attached to the long line of luxury hotels overlooking the beach. Lay back with a drink on a beach recliner before enjoying the clear, warm blue water. "
ABryceT,"Seoul, South Korea",Jun 2015,"My wife and I stayed in Nusa Dua, at the Nusa Dua Beach Resort for the last three days of our honeymoon. The beach and the resort were beautiful. the perfect ending to our Bali trip."
Michiel B,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2015,"Beautiful beach, but the water is too shallow to swim in and there is a lot of sea weed as well. We were a bit disappointed."
Thomas H,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Oct 2015,We walked the full length of the walkway along the Nusa Dua Beach every morning after having enjoyed the sunrise. We enjoyed the atmosphere of the local people setting up their shops and stands as well as meeting all the other visitors on their respective morning jogging or bicycle ride.
Sarah T,Perth,Jan 2015,"Lots happening on foreshore, nice vibe, lots of hotel sun beds and cabanas as many hotels have ocean frontage"
Bambang Ismanto,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"We spent 2 nights in this hotel including gala dinner in near beach facility. It is very good hotel in term of services, facilities and good surrounding tousrist areas."
Jaymie18,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,great for water sports and fascinating scenery!  We walked along the shore and appreciate the white powder sand. Nice white beach pictorial =)
mgdgmgng,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,"great beach for sports, a fair bit of rubbish near water's edge, also some nasty rocks in actual water so care to be taken."
SigitaVilnius,Vilnius,Oct 2015,"Nusa Dua area is nice and clean. The beach is long and sandy.At 11 am it was empty. Maybe because of low tide? We walked 100 meters to the sea and it was still impossible to swim :( Dead coral reef first and then some kind of vulcanic rocks (?). They are not sharp, but doesn't feel ok.As soon as we reached a spot, where the bottom drops down and it is possible to swim, the big waves scared us back to the shore again.Well, this is nature, but it's a pitty, that we came here with a purpose and had nothing good of it."
steveamcb,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,"Used this beach a few days, and found it to be very pleasant with clear, clean water.  Most of the hotels have buoys about 75m out and recommend that you don't swim out further.  There wee no strong currents as often found in Kuta. "
Amir R,"Tehran, Iran",Oct 2015,"the beach is a safe and good place for kids,familes but not the best choice for surfing and water adventures. if u are looking for some peacefull romantic place do not miss nusa dua beach specially in the evenings. u can grab a drink and enjoy the scenery."
Shahnawaz N,"Bengaluru, India",May 2015,"Beautiful beach, clean and vast. Waters are clear and place is idle for beach sports. A hangout with you sweetheart is the best treat."
AussieAussie77,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2015,"Lets be blunt - a lot of the beaches in Bali are not that great. Think Kuta and Jimbaran - any beach in Australia is better. Nusa Dua is the exception - its a beautiful long stretch of beach. The sand is nice, the waves not too big and the water clean.The beach is lined with 5 star resorts. They all have water sports available for rent - like jet skis and kayaks. If you aren't staying in a resort some of them will still let you hire their equipment. Just go into the hotel and walk through to the beach. Best to call the resort first to check though, as the resorts are sprawling and its not that easy to walk from one to the next if you wind up in one that doesn't have equipment for hire."
VladBull,Romania,Oct 2015,"Very nice beach, clean and big. The water is very hot and with little waves(or at least i was lucky to catch it like that) but full of seaweed."
M M,Florida,Oct 2015,"Great sandy beach.....super for long walks.Water is clear...BUT EXPECT TONS OF GARBAGE (plastic bags in the water like I have not seen in any other part of the world.....)Huge disappointment !,,The hotels famous names like: Hyatt,  Mercure etc etc.....should invest in maintaining the beaches clean.....all they do is dig a hole in the sand and dump the trash...then cover it....NOT ACCEPTABLE! Shameful ."
Theo1526,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2015,"Somehow I was amazed that the pool water is so warm and it makes us feel relaxed and rejuvenated after using the pool. The food around the pool is just perfect. It has direct access to the beach and it is what makes it very much enjoyable. They are building a new restaurant now and it was under construction when I was there. I will come back to give a try. very nice bamboo looking restaurants! We were taken care of the Manager, Mr. Erawan. He is just the best! Anything you need to ask, Please come and ask him, He will guide you to know more about the hotel experience. Thank you Mr. Erawan!"
GT-martin,"Terneuzen, The Netherlands",Oct 2015,Nusa Dua beach is inside a hotel complex where you would either see tourists or hotel personnel. The hotels are quite packed with each other as well.
Rrixon,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Nov 2014,As a couple we loved Nusa Dua.  If you want something away from the hustle and bustle then this is the place.  Its a very relaxing area and great for couples wanting to chill out.  The resorts are all very beautiful with peaceful secluded gardens and little bali huts for relaxing massages by the beach.  All of them have beach chairs set up with shade and service on the beach for drinks and food.  Loved it!
SubhashDJ,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,"Very calm, quiet and clean beach. Near to Nusa Dua peninsula island. A big statue of ""Krishna & Arjun"" can be seen from long distance. You can experience turbulent waves dashing against porous sandstone rocks in a thrilling view. Beach is safe for bath.Walking disatnce from Nusa Dua main market place."
natalie b,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"A most tranquil and beautiful beach in Bali. Golden sands, Palm trees and crystal clear waters make for a most enjoyable and tranquil visit."
beachaussie,Collaroy,Aug 2015,Perfect for peace and quite and service. Drinks very expensive unless you have local Bintang Beer. Food expensive but cheaper if you use SPG Card. Service and staff amazing. Not much night life but no hustle and bustle like Kuta. Lots of water sports.
Jessy S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,Clean beach but there is not much water during low tide. So you should check tide chart before going to the beach
Diane A,"Mandurah, Australia",Sep 2015,"Clean, white sandy beach.  Very quiet and private.  People were have marriage ceremonies there.  Also camel rides."
trevorpaterson,"North Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,We decided on a water experience that delivers thrill and excitement and that is what we got.The double para sail was an experience nice to share the experience of thrill and views. The flying fish was also a great experience well worth the visit if you like water sports
sunnykullar1968,"Chandigarh, India",Oct 2015,A clean and fresh beach lagoon with very calm waters. Corals after 30 meters can be hurting. Great for evening strolls
samuelp82,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,Some parts of the beach are bought and maintained by the different hotels so non hotel occupants are not allowed to use that area.
Tommy2124,"Motherwell, UK",Sep 2015,"Nice long safe beach, with various patrols. Great area near the monuments to watch the waves break through the lava flames.Wear appropriate footwear if going out to the reef at low tide ."
Selina K,100 contributions,Sep 2015,"Clean, beautiful and just right. The sea tide gets very low in the evening, so watch out for sea urchins! "
depti70,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2015,"The hotel have loungers food, drinks which made this beach perfect very little hassle from vendors so you could sleep in peace !  Staff extremely friendly, quick service for drinks and food from the beachside restuarant, breakfast on the beach was a great way to start the day."
Lisa  S,Australia,Sep 2015,When its low tide.........its low tide - no swimming.    BUT take reef shoes if you  have them.   We were restricted to sandy areas only during low tide.  
Micko W,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2015,Great views of the ocean. There is often many different ships and yachts in the distance. One time there was what looked to be a fleet of US War Ships.
Louinsydney,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,We only used this beach near to our hotel/resort. Very clean and pretty beach. Lots of water sports available to do. 
TFCF,Sydney,Sep 2015,Beautifully manicured beach. Clear protected waters. Great walk along the water front to watch the locals in the mornings. 
Maui Thepoortraveler,Philippines,Aug 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is one of the nicest white sandy beach in Bali. The shoreline is good for those who wants sun bathing and walking.
Dalestacey,"Fort Worth, TX",Sep 2015,Enjoyed one day here.  The water is crystal clear.  There is shade and the Marriott provided us transportation to and from hotel.  A quick little ride.  A must do when in Nusa Dua.
Katmo1864,"Los Angeles, CA",Sep 2015,"Beautiful, long white sandy beach. Stunning! Great for long walks and watching the waves. Not good for snorkeling."
upkudonirastreet,"Jacksonville, FL",Sep 2015,It's s great sandy beachWater is niceIt's much better for surfing as there are some monster breaks not far from sureNot great for casual swimming as the currents can be extremely strong I do not recommend swimming there if you are not a strong swimmer who is aware of and able to handle currentIf this is the case stay in one of the beautiful pools
Nada M,"Prague, Czech Republic",Oct 2015,"Long white sandy beach sharing between more hotels but still big enough to find you own place. Clear water, just be carefull of strong currents. "
FeetForTravel,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,"My family stayed at the Novotel Residences for the Nusa Dua part of our trip. Each hotel has a private beach that belongs to the hotel and then there are ""public"" parts of the beach too. Just to be clear Nusa Dua is an area and there's a long stretch of beaches along the Nusa Dua area. I swam outside the Novotel stretch and walked up as far north as I could go. The water outside our stretch was clean, clear and lovely however extremely strong rip heading north and for a seasoned snorkeller, this is NOT the place to seek your tropical underwater adventure (try the islands for that). The reef here has been destroyed, we spotted ONE clown fish in a lonely anemone. As you head north, when the tide is out, you can't swim at all unless you want to walk out through the rocks and seaweed. My advice, find out where you want to stay and then ask the hotel about the beach area, some hotels have direct beach access, some, like Novotel, you need to catch a shuttle which is easy enough."
Vicky H,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Beautiful beach to just relax on. Perfect for all ages as it's so calm. Plenty of watersports available for those who want some adventure. The local sellers are all very polite and friendly.
Yrolg,120 contributions,Oct 2015,"We were stayed at Kuta, we took kura kura bus from beach walk to DFS then transit to nusa dua, return tickets cost Irp 140000 pp, the beach is clean and not crowded, but we can't find any Balinese rent the lounge chair! So end up we join the agendaz beach club, NO entrance fee there, we just need to buy food or drink in the restaurant, we only paid for Irp 150000 pp for meal and drink, and the coffee was buy 1 get 1 free, then we can use the lounge chair and swimming pool. During afternoon low tide, most of the beach was just ankle deep. We enjoyed a lot, highly recommend!!!"
rub_the_rhino,"Queensland, Australia",Oct 2015,Went to Nusa Dua for something to do. The beach is nice but it is a bit boring. I can see why it might be nice if you were staying at one of the resorts but not worth a special trip. We are spoilt for beaches in Queensland but I just found this to be dull. It's clean and so is the water so that is a plus but don't travel just to hang out there. 
ilovefrance12,"Whangarei, New Zealand",Sep 2015,"We were staying in Sanur and visited Nusa Dua beach during a day trip. We had a lovely swim here and found the beach to be not too busy, clean, and the water pleasant. "
Kate2112,"Barcelona, Spain",May 2015,"We stayed at Westin Resort, their part of the beach was beautifully cared for and clean. The resorts swimming pools are fantastic but if you like some waves and clean seawater this beach is ideal. There are very few vendors on this beach, they do not harass or badger you to buy their wares or experiences."
Doyleygirl,"Harpenden, UK",Sep 2015,"Gorgeous beach, which stretches for many miles.  Though the sand is white, the sea is not always as turquoise as the pictures make out.... "
nanda0425,"Severna Park, MD",Sep 2015,gorgeous beach and sunrise! love to be walking on the boardwalk and look at the spectacular view. incredible people and food....
4EvaMakinMemories,"Blaxland, Australia",Oct 2015,We visited the Nusa Dual Water blow on the Nusa Dual Peninsula Island on a perfect sunny day. The view is great however be visited at low tide. The water blow was still active however the water was not splashing up as high because of the low tide. I suggest to visit at High tide and chances are you might even get wet. Only a short walk from Nusa Dua Beach and resorts. But be careful of the sharp rocks and don't get to close the edge.
Cheryl K,"Greater Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is great fun - tide in or out. Great swimming in warm waters and you can snorkel too. There is a lot of room to set up on the beach without feeling cramped or having your privacy invaded.  Refreshments are never too far away and check out the lovely ladies selling sunnies, sarongs and hats- great variety and prices. When the tide goes out you can walk along where you were swimming earlier. Enjoy watching the locals raking up fresh seaweed and fishing with their traditional baskets too - magic, and I think I had some of the seaweed at breakfast the next day."
Shantanu Jalgaonkar,"Pune, India",Oct 2015,I was here on the beach in Oct 15. Most of the places on beach is reserved by five star hotels. There is only one place where you can rent a bed. Massage on beach was one of the best. The beach is amazing.
G N,"London, UK",Oct 2015,"We came from Ubud and stayed in Nusa Dua - the beach definitely gives us an immediate resort feeling (particularly moving from a busy Ubud center).  The beach is a great chill out place to get some tranquility with decent crowd of people.  Can do some surfing, swimming with less crowd.  Highly recommended."
Ross R,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2015,While we were there the beach at the Grand Nikko was closed most days due to strong rip along the beach front. 
srminchina,"Shenzhen, China",Oct 2015,"clean and uncrowded, a delightful retreat from the dogs and seediness that is present on Kuta beach.  Much slower pace and not so many vendors selling useless things to tourists."
Lisa F,"Karalee, Australia",Sep 2015,"It was a fun day. Did banana boat, parasailing, fly fish, jet ski, snorkelling and visited turtle island. Got transfers from hotel included in price for a total of 500000rup each. Parasailing was off the beach which was surprising. But it was good, easy and fun. The hardest bit was going up and down rocks. Fly fish was ok, the lighter you are the more you go up so I didn't go up as much as the kids. Jet ski was fun but almost whacked my head when the guy was steering and they needed more of them. Turtle island has a 20000rup donation fee each to visit which we didn't get told about so it was lucky we had the money cause we weren't bringing much. Sunscreen needed and toilets are below average but I presume they are constantly wet."
Arselie M,"Los Angeles, CA",Oct 2015,"My finance and I spent two weeks exploring Bali and this was by far our favorite beach.  Super fine white sand, gorgeous views and plenty to do.  There was a lovely breeze that kept the temperatures nice and it was easy to find a coushioned lounge chair in our out of the shade.Big disclaimer: this is an absolute resort town.  Very Vegas-ey style hotels, some trying to be more ornate than others but the beaches themselves are well mantained and perfect for relaxation.There were a few vendors coming by with sarongs, massage offers, and water activities.  The jet ski vendors were really pushing hard since their time is more limited for business.  The tide goes out in the afternoon starting around 1-2pm and becomes ankle deep all the way from the shoreline to the safety boueys."
FNula,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2014,"My first and last time in Nusa Dua. This is a place that was never meant to be a beach and lacks any natural beauty. That combined with the wave upon wave of five star concrete edifices resulted in a place lacking in any charm. Perfect for business, but not for a beach holiday."
WSH83,"Kuching, Malaysia",Sep 2015,Really nice beach especially if you book at hotel that has private area. But it does not have sunset as it is facing west. The beach is calm and less wavy. It will very quiet area if you enjoy privacy.
silkyzoe,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach in front of the hotels is kept clean and traders are few however get away from that area and you come across lots of rubbish washed up. Plastic bottles,seaweed that smells and other things. I know the seaweed is natural but all else needs attention"
inkypete,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Nice beach with serious tides. The water is clean compared to the other tourist areas (Kuta/Legian) but a fair bit of kelp. Nice to paddle but not a good swimming beach.
Claire C,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,"large beach made of soft sand , ideal for children to play on and not crowded. the water does not have any waves so ill not frighten little children."
Shelley C,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,A total contrast to beaches on the West Coast of Bali.  Beach is long and clean with relatively few hawkers. Sand is obviously trucked in by the high end resorts - you can feel the difference when you are out the front of the better resorts.
184Anna,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2015,"Since we were staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel we spent some time exploring the area which included the beach at Nusa Dua. The beach was lovely, clean and rubbish free.  The water was warm and safe for swimming probably not great for surfers because of the reef close to shore but great for families."
bethaniaphung,"Bogor, Indonesia",Aug 2015,Go try water blow in Nusa Dua area. Waiting for the water hit the rock on the edge of the bridge and when it hits the water will goes up.
Joy M,327 contributions,Aug 2015,"Really relaxing beach for swimming. Even if you aren't at one of the Nusa Dua resorts, this is a great beach for swimming. Plenty of warungs for good food too!"
Amelia W,10 contributions,Sep 2015,The beach got many seaweeds and plastic. Im talking about the beach on Ayodya Nusa Dua. Its beautiful if maintained nicely.. what a pitty.
Abhay P,Mumbai,May 2015,"Lil bit expensive. Most of the outlet own by a private hotels, so you have to pay for rides to get in. Our guide had connections with the local outlet and I could go in for sneak preview, and a discount was offered. But we were not in for water sports and so we decided not to go in.That was good decision as I observed the way parasailing is done. We had done parasailing in Tarkali in India and at Pattaya, Thailand from moving boat and platform in sea. But at Nusa Dua, they hook you up while you are standing on beach sand and ask you run. The boat pickups speed and you are dragged a bit. The worst part is landing. When you are about to touch the ground 2-3 guys jump on you to stop and hold while you are getting dragged. Lot of tourists get injured, bruising on hand and on legs are common. It's very dangerous.Go on your own risk."
Jeffrey C,52 contributions,Sep 2015,It a nice place to relax...You can spend the whole afternoon at here..The seaside is clean compare to other beach at Bali and sea is clear as well.
mandywu,singapore,Sep 2015,"Good to come here with kids, water is very clear and not deep,no much water sports.  We spent one hour here, kids enjoy in playing sands here. "
Rabbito1983,"Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2015,"We enjoyed the watersports did jetski, banana boat & parasailing. They will be flexible on pricing so barter & get the best price!! Its pretty kaotic on the water and on the shore with all the tourists in and out of their activities so its not at all a place to go to relax, swim or sunbake! Aside from the watersports we would not go back there."
Irvan17,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"most probably the best beach in Bali, cause it's clean, not crowded, a bit too expensive s most of the outlet own by a private hotel, but well worth it"
Yasemin U,1 contribution,Sep 2015,"on september 12, we came to nusa dua snd could not found any sea side similar to the pictures.no area to swim"
ronaulikasih,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,Clean..... Love it .. Compare to other beaches... It's my fave one ... I can spend most of my time here
The_Rock_50,"Mount Pearl, Canada",Sep 2015,"If you`re staying in the Nusa Dua resort area, it is a must to do the walk by the ocean.  Great to do in the morning for the exercise, the view and for the experience.If you can get up early enough to watch the sunrise, it is spectacular.  Do not forget your camera...  Note that the sun rises above the horizon about 20 to 30 minutes after the first daylights.  The first day we went at sunrise, we left too early thinking there were too much clouds and the sun was already up.  The second day we stayed and found out the truth... What a show!In the evening, you can walk and enjoy a meal at a variety of places (resorts) along the way, with the sound of the ocean, the vibe of the people around and also some live music.It is important to know there is a presence of quite a few security guards along the way to give a feeling of safety in this restricted area of the resorts.  This is a welcome feature when you`re walking in the evening."
Mike M,"Hatfield Peverel, UK",Sep 2015,Fantastic beach with lovely white sand and beautiful clear water. Good safe beach for children although the tide does go in and out daily.
suej5956,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2015,White sand - very clean.  They grade the beach every day.  Waves crashing over the peninsula was a highlight.
Tony_Karner,142 contributions,Sep 2015,"A very nice complex in a very nice corner. Kinda exclusive area too for most travelers. But since they have an open area too, so it was OK to visit. Hopefully they keep maintain even make it more clean as I still saw many garbage in that little island!"
laurie m,",elbour e",Aug 2015,This is an amazing beach beautiful white sand that stretches for miles. You are able to walk on a footpath or hire bikes. The path takes you pass all the wonderful resorts on this side of the island. Lots of places to stop for a meal or drinks lots of water activities offered as well.
Tarek B,"Alexandria, Egypt",Sep 2015,I stayed at laguna hotel the beach is nice and the atmostphere is perfect for relaxation . One note is that due to tides at sunrise you will find litteraly no sea by the beach become swamps all the way up to a barrier couple 100 m away . This effect is till 8 pm . Quite a disapointment if wanted to have a sun rise dip in the ocean 
jimbo778_2000,"Harpenden, UK",Sep 2015,"As our review is based more as a comparative, I would firstly just mention that we visited the following beaches while in Bali: Kuta, Seminyak, Jimbaran and Nusa Dua.Obviously Nusa Dua beach is a fairly large stretch of beach and therefore our views might not encompass the whole area...although we did go back a second time to a different area still on the same beach.Overall, I found this beach to be clean and the waves weren't too big as I did actually manage to go for a swim. However, the currents are quite strong and you need to be careful with weak swimmers or children. There are also far far fewer interruptions from sellers than some of the others like Kuta/Seminyak.The first time we visited we paid 200,000 for two sunbeds with an umbrella in a hotel complexes private area. As a result we had no interruptions and were able to go to the hotel for lunch and a swim in the pool if we wanted. To be honest, I think we could have maybe bargained them down but we didn't bother.The second time we paid 50,000 for two in a different area of Nusa Dua and this was on the public beach. We were asked about massages and offered other goods for sale but not too many times and they were always polite and left us alone when we said we weren't interested.."
John T,"Balclutha, New Zealand",Sep 2015,Beautiful beach that seems to stretch on for miles.  Our access was attached to the Novotel beach club so there were also actives included.  The water in September is like a warm bath. 
Norazelin,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2015,"Once my flight ticket to Bali was confirmed, the first activity that crossed my mind is Sea Walking! I don't swim and also don't dive, so this is the most suitable activity for me to discover underwater world. LOL. I would say it was a gamble visit to Nusa Dua without any booking for the water sport activity. We arrived at 10.30 am, and walk in to the one of the water sports activities agent. I don't remember what's the agency name but we were surprised the cost for the sea walking is USD120 per head and just left the agency and went to another agency, Watermark. Here, the cost also is quite expensive but after a long negotiation session, we were so lucky to get only IDR 1,000,000 for 2! It's a local rate! My advice for those who wants to do the water sports activities, please book in advance via online booking, much cheaper compared to walk in price. Unless you are lucky like us, you will get a good bargain :). Another thing, please bring along your gopro to capture underwater moments or else you have to pay another IDR 1,000,000 for  them to capture your pictures and videos."
Omar M,5 contributions,Sep 2015,Amazing beach with amazing activities and water sports where one can enjoy the sun the fresh air and the activities
ros301,"Newcastle, Australia",Aug 2015,"Nice yellow sand beach. Plenty of water sports available when the tide is in. No waves so not suitable for surfing, but nice for swimming once you get past the broken coral at the water edge."
messyw10,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,"Beach has a lot of seashells which cover the entire lower stretch of sand before hitting the seawater.  This made it near impossible to walk to the beach without shoes. A suggestion may be for hotels to clean up the stretch of beach which they ""occupy"". "
Seat_0A,"Schoorl, The Netherlands",Sep 2015,"This stretch of beach is a wonderfully clean beach. They even sweep the beach every day. There is a reef just off shore, so the water is reasonably calm. Snorkling is great too. "
RossoDiavel,"New York City, NY",Aug 2015,"When high tide, it's nice yellow sand ( not white ) beach but during low tide there is no more swimming or any water activities "
Zenmaster777,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2015,"Kuta maybe where the action and noise is, Nusa Dua is the quieter beach. It is relatively cleaner and far quieter beach to spend the day. It is fewer hawkers, and those that are there leave you alone. The children can play freely around. Though when the water goes down in low tide you have to be careful of the rocks and any dangerous sea creatures in case you step on them."
John C,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Good beach for families n very safe for swimming but tide reveals large coral n detracts from all round enjoyment definitely not for surfers

886kelvin,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Even though this is a made for Tourist Complex there are some beautiful Hotels here plus unpolluted Sea , nice Gardens and white Sand Beaches ."
simondedye,18 contributions,Sep 2015,"Suitable for family recreation. Nice beach and clean, The park is clean and cool.. children can play freely. We suggest you to visit this beach when you are in bali.."
kunalbagrecha,"Udaipur, India",Aug 2015,"An absolutely beautiful place to visit. Nice beach along with good shops to shop from. Also, enjoyed a lot in the waters."
Alaa E,"Amman, Jordan",Oct 2014,"Clean and nice, but you have to be careful and ware sea shoes in your foot as the ground is rocky inside the water and there are some dangerous creatures if you step on them"
AWorldView,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2015,"Great fun with water activities like jet ski,parasailing,bannana boat,fly fish and many others on this beautiful,clean and amazing blue waters on the Nusa Dua beach...must spend at least a day here on this beach whilst in Bali !!!"
jogeshlulla,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2015,Nusa Dua beach is a nice clean beach and great for water sports. It is a lot cleaner and quieter than Kuta. I would recommend this part of Bali if you are looking for a quiet time.
KXCAUS,London,Sep 2015,"Beautiful calm waters, lovely aqua colours and not too deep so great for taking a dip without massive waves.  Most of the Nusa Dua beach area is private beaches belonging to big hotel chains, so great if you are staying in one of them, if not, then you are restricted to a few crappy sections of the beach without sunloungers.  Very relaxing beach environment with no street vendors to harass you.  be warned though, there are only hotel bars and restaurants along the beach with prices that are higher than Australian restaurants (and not always as good a quality)."
Abhilash Sahoo,"Pune, India",Sep 2015,"The peaceful, cleanliness and serenity of the beach is incomparable. Nusa dua is for luxury travelers. Its awesome"
Diverdoon,van bc,Aug 2015,"We were staying in the Canguu area close to Echo beach but liked Nusa Dua much better, Its all about sand color and peacefulness . Good loungers at a good price and fully serviced by local beach restaurants."
Shirley C,"Oldham, England, United Kingdom",Nov 2014,"What a gorgeous beach, hotel was fab nothing can compare to this hotel The Laguna a luxury collection resort and spa all inclusive, swim up bars and restaurants' where all amazing would love to go again and again"
Loeneberga,"Prague, Czech Republic",Sep 2015,"Located on the South-East peninsula it is a very quiet place to relax. There are many five-star Hotels to choose from (I can recommend highly the Conrad Bali), but due to the outer reef and tides, swimming is possible only during high tide. The beaches in Bali are nothing special, and Nusa Dua is no exception. Anyone after a really nice beach should skip Bali."
foxsaken,Malaysia,Oct 2014,"A place to dive and swimming all day long, all the wisata ( water sports ) can be found here with a bargain price"
Jo L,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,We stayed in The Mulia which is very close the Nusa Dua beach. Part of the beach is limited to resort guests only so it's not as noisy and crowded as the Jimbaran beach. Water is clearer too.
Sari H,Serbia,Aug 2015,"Had a fun and exciting day there. Did jet ski , para sailing and banana boat ride. Great time and very helpful guides assistance. Explaining the process from start to finish. A definite to do if into water sports"
Lea W,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Nusa Dua is the Bali's posh resort with big hotels but I saw many locals heading over there for the beaches, especially when it was low tide and there was more space on the beach. I'd definitely recommend the place for a good chill on the beach and an adrenaline rush if you go with a scooter through the airport bypass expressway."
terry s,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,if you want rest and relaxation stay or visit this area.so much different to kuta or legian.just dream and have fun.
Alex J,"Athens, Greece",Aug 2015,"10 years ago, this beach was a a beautiful long stretch of sand, with some waves - now it has been spoiled by the various hotels who've decided to create supposedly picturesque (and tourist-safe) little bays protected by wave-breakers. In reality, the waters are muddy and sea-weed is constantly swept ashore (and the hotels have countless people sweeping and burying this weed). Besides that, these hotels (many of which non-guests are prohibited of entering even to use the cafe or restaurant) occupy all the beachfront, not allowing independent restaurants or cafes to offer their services. "
Savalicious,Melbourne Vic,Oct 2014,Beautiful tropical beach with clear warm water. Very well maintained and safe for the kids with minimal wave and current activity.
Isabel B,"Heidelberg, Germany",Sep 2015,"The beach is really nice, but you should go there in the afternoon. The sea looks a lot nicer then and there is less sea grass in it. Sunbeds and umbrella are around 50k rp."
Nanontour,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2014,"Beautiful beach near the Ayodya Resort, but watch out for the 'hawkers' selling their wares, unless you really want to buy a beach sari etc.....but they can be annoying.....they are not allowed past a certain point of the resort, so it is only if you are walking on the beach that they can be annoying......BUT the beach is CLEAN and lovely and was not overly busy with people when we were there."
Joannes Rhino,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Nice calm beach. It's where the high-end society normally likes to hangout. Highly recommended. It has access to several nice spots, like waterblow, cultural park, hotels, restaurants, museums, shopping center. Overall, you can find almost anything nearby. "
msihua,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Lovely quiet beach, with loads of European tourists sunbathing (meant that everyone was enjoying their own quite time and space). Brilliant!The only downside was that the water was very much covered with pebbles and sharp rocks (be careful), but the water was clear and blue!"
sam0man,"Muscat Governorate, Oman",Aug 2015,It was a THRILL - my first-time fly fishing and parasailing! The banana boat ride and jet ski were equally FUNtastic! Thanks to the staff and professional experts who made it all seem quite easy and in safe hands.
Liliana258,"Hamilton, Canada",Aug 2015,"There is something you should know about Nusa Dua Beach.  While it is always fascinating to look and provides excellent facilities, there is high tide and low tide.  At low tide you can make an inventory of everything you were stepping on trying to make your way into the water.  This is not the Carribean, there are interesting water creatures like nasty looking seastars, and some garbage always is being brought to the shore washed by the waves.  The view of the sunrise and the walkway along the beach make up for it though. You can walk, bike, run the long path connecting all the hotels on one side the gardens and the other the view and breeze provided by the sea."
Simran S,31 contributions,Aug 2015,"We traveled here for our honeymoon and stayed at Kayumanis (which we would highly recommend).The water was so clear (you could see right through it).  The weather (August) was really perfect.  Not too hot (low 80s F) and also a nice breeze.  Wonderful!But if you are looking for a lot of nightlife, there isnt much.This is pefect for relaxation and water sports!"
dYquem,London,Aug 2015,"We had our own reserved sunbeds in front of our villa, so fantastic service.  Couldn't really ask for more.  We didn't really venture to other parts of the beach because we didn't need to."
Victoria M,22 contributions,Aug 2015,Best at high tide due to rocks in area when tide goes out. Not many food vendors. Sand quality is good.
Sirianong_serene,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",May 2015,Beautiful and clean beach. Love waking in the sunset time and exploring the sea animal in the rock pool.
Steven C,Playa De Las Americas,Jun 2015,A stunning beach to take a nice long relxing walk. Cant help want to stop and take in surroundings. Lots of bars and eating places on the beach and there is a fantastic place to get a very good cheap massage! 
crosschap,london,Aug 2015,"We highly recommend Made Chepot +6281 338 174 561 He collected us from our hotel In Nusa Dua ahead of our pick up time and helped us plan our itinerary, ensuring we went to the places in order of how busy they would be and the traffic to get there. His car was very clean, great air conditioning and very spacious for our family of five. He over ran his time booked with us as we wanted to visit a temple right at the end of the day. He was friendly and cheerful all day and knew all the short cuts. He is a family man and very professional."
Christiana T,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Aug 2015,Clean Beach.. white sand but the water is to strong and you cant swimm just relax and enjoy the view!
TheTravelingSun,23 contributions,Aug 2015,BEACH is what i love from vacation and this was a pretty one. it was relaxing not much vendors and i love the sand and clear waters
OZS_ATW,"Budapest, Hungary",Jan 2015,It is a nice beach but there are some stray dogs like everywhere in Bali.... You can enjoy a a beautiful sunset from the beach! That is great! :-)
FaisalNM,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2015,"We went to Nusa Dua for the water sports activities. Most drivers have a ""setting"" with the water sport service providers. You can negotiate as much as you want and most times, you can crack the deal. Important to check the changing rooms facilities and the toilet cleanliness before you book your water sports! We made this mistake, our place did not have a changing room and the toilets were extremely dirty. Gets too crowded at times with groups queuing up. Plan about 2 hours extra on your budgeted time. Overall, a good experience as our kids enjoyed it. We found many luxury hotels here and I'm left to wonder how the guests will enjoy their privacy due to the over commercialisation in this area..."
Diana M,"Crowborough, UK",Aug 2015,"Lovely beach, fine whitish sand, warm water, wide beach. Nice resort area. This is one of the nicest beaches on Bali."
Umar F,Colombo,Dec 2014,It was a good decision for us to go there when the sun was setting. You do not get the best view of the sunset since it faces the opposite direction and therefore it's best to catch the sunrise. Nevertheless the visit was well worth it.
JGC14,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2015,"Nusa Dua beach is a long stretch of sand, suitable for swimming and water sports. There is also a nice walking path so you can easily walk along the beach and all the hotels & restaurants. "
Looweese b,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2015,Lovely morning and afternoon walks...very clean lively aspect going from one resort to another.I did find it expensive  but i guess its up to what quality your after your happy to pay.
Jean Stephane R,"Budapest, Hungary",Apr 2015,Very clean sea shore with small places where you can have very romantic evening and have a drink. some of the place proposed some live acoustic music which makes the evening even more pleasant. The water is warm and waves can be quite big if you would like surfing.
willjelbert,"Somerset West, South Africa",Jun 2015,The white sands of this clean beach makes it a great chill out spot. Lots of water sports on offer by the surrounding hotels and good restaurants to visit at night. No harassment by folks trying to sell their goods.
Alexander F,32 contributions,Aug 2015,"We had been in Inaya Putri (around Hyatt, Novotel, etc) and walked there a few times. But everywhere the water was not that nice for swimming. Many mussels and many seaweeds. Beside this it is a nice beach with mainly big hotel chain resorts where you can relax and enjoy the beach. Overall it's nice, but not that special as the reputation. "
Subhasree789,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Clean and calm beach, good time spent early in the morning. DOnt forget to take your SPF, hat and sunglasses for the beach!"
CareyPearson,"Berlin, Germany",Jul 2015,"Stayed at a hotel right on the beach at Nusa Dua. We were advised that some beaches in Bali can be disappointing. You won't be disappointed with Nusa Dua beach. Great for evening walks, with white sand. "
Dpradhan,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Sunset, Coconut or ice cream, may be just a jog. You will love it all. nice and clean. Yes good enough to spend an evening if staying close by."
jlabreu72,"Porto, Portugal",Aug 2015,"Probably the best beach in Bali, clean water, great sights and lot's of very good hotels and restaurants."
Sumil_D3,"Bengaluru, India",Sep 2014,"Did scuba diving, para sailing, banana boat ride here. This beach has the cleanest water in bali suitable for underwater activities. Have to bargain a bit on the packages but you can have a lifetime experience in here. "
meenu a,Pathankot,Dec 2014,"White sand Geger Beach (Nusa Dua) is a definite visit in any tourist's checklist when in Bali... Beautiful and clean. Specially recommended to be visited during the day. When here, get wet during water activities and don't forget a visit to the Turtle Island. Note: Please do negotiate on prices for water sports and Turtle Island.The ride to the Turtle Island was very exiting. A secluded conservation site with beautifully raised turtles. Its an amazing experience to watch the life-cycle of the turtle, from the young to the oldest, off-course other animals also get their fair share of viewers."
llsaPortElliot,Port Elliot,Jan 2015,"Lots to do nearby with many eating houses, massages and peaceful strolls.Nusa Dua is away from the hustle and bustle of the major tourist area in Bali offering a relaxed and lest stressful experience."
Cristian B,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"The sand is white and the water clean very nice beach the get sun,arround the beach also there are many restaurant so easy to find food and drinks "
cenk_iz,"Lyon, France",Aug 2015,It is a white sandy beach with full of mid and high level resorts along. If you want to swim you should avoid going there in the afternoon otherwise you will face a swampy place due to low tide which is not reflecting the turquoise blue pictures at all and you will be disappointed.
Romeo S,"Mascot, Australia",Jan 2015,Nice and quite beach with not too many people. Sunrise is always great and good track for jogging in the morning
AlbertN101,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Lovely blue water. Saw lots of marine life the kids were specially interested in a bunch of crabs and starfish. Very shallow and clean, found some mussels and an interesting bunch of shells."
NathiOslo,"Oslo, Norway",Mar 2015,"Beautiful long beach even with hotels the whole shore, shallow water, great sand and very funny things in the water at low tide"
Carven W,"Naarden, The Netherlands",May 2015,Love the beach is clean and water is clear. We enjoyed this beach so much we were here everyday. Not busy and is a great family beach.
jh_panjalai1306,"Saba, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Visited the  beach many times,always enjoy a swimming and it's surrounding so much . No vendors hassling.."
Chris C,"Norwich, UK",Nov 2014,"Very nice quiet and fantastic beaches, a lovely place to walk along the beach and enjoy the loneliness of the whole place  all to yourself"
MC3T3,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2015,"Long stretch of sand with numerous hotels/resorts having their private beach there. Quite clean, very calm and warm water as the waves break on the reef out in the sea. Shallow water though, not really possible to swim close to the beach. Nice promenade along the beach, numerous hotel restaurants and beach cafes as well.  "
Vincent J,"Breda, The Netherlands",Aug 2015,There are some nice resorts along this beach. the beach itself is white sand. There are almost no waves as the area is protected by canal reefs a few hundred meters out from the beach. The beach is not spectacular - most people stay at the resort pools.
ankit a,127 contributions,Mar 2015,"The white sand beach is awesome to hang out on the beach, the sand is rough, but one can enjoy the pristine beauty of the place.Mostly all beaches are private beaches maintained by respective hotels, Theres water sports provided by the hotel on charge basis and also one gets towels for use (free of cost, the hotel at the time of checkin gives u a card for the same)"
debbie8484,athens,Sep 2014,"Nice scenery, not very good for swimming though as the water is too shallow and Thera are strong currents"
Jillian P,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Mar 2015,"Visual beauty, clean beach clear water. Just overlook the various sellers of jewellry and fabric items or enjoy their banter."
Peter F,139 contributions,Aug 2015,The beach was easily accessible and clean. There are places to sit and get basic drinks. Some people selling trinkets but not too bad.
Susan B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2015,"Too many people taking parasailing which is $40US for like 5 minutes. If you want to go to a beach for a day, get your driver to bring you to the resort side of the beaches."
eyee5,"Omaha, NE",Aug 2015,"Clean and beautiful beach.  Lots of vendors selling kites, shells, and sarongs for really cheap.  Really a good place to relax."
KerrinR122,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Jul 2015,Amazing. Very busy. Plenty to do for the adventure seekers who like water sports. Or just relax on the beach.
Monika W,"London, England, United Kingdom",Aug 2015,This is really nice beach it is not authentic Bali beach but other beaches has dark volcanic sand -this beach have nice sand is long and big there is many luxury hotel and very quiet ...
Lilicubely,Singapore,Oct 2014,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore. It was the third time to Bali, so we wanted to stay at a clean and quiet beach, with no vendor bothering us, and where kids could swim in the sea. Purpose was just to relax.We found all this in Nusa Dua, although the area is secluded and the beach could be anywhere on the globe, as there is no specific Balinese taste when you are on this beach. But we knew it and just wanted to experience this for 5 days, not far from home.The sand was clean and blond as well, very nice. We could swim in the lagoon where the water was clear and pristine. There is a promenade along the beach, connecting all the hotels on this beach, most of them of high-end to luxury. The architectural design of most hotels fits well with the nature (wood/local style). The hotel buildings are also usually set back from the beach. So the natural seafront landscapte is relatively more preserved than on other sanur or kuta beaches.Of note, in South Bali, we find most beaches crowed, dirty and full of vendors that are very anoying sometimes. Some may say the vendors are part of the local experience. Agree but when it disturbs you, it is not pleasant at all. As for Nusa Dua beach, only 2 accredited vendors per hotel are allowed to sell stuff on the beach to guests and most of them are very polite and relatively discret."
Serhan T,46 contributions,Feb 2015,"I didn't feel I am in authentic Bali but somewhere very isolated and modern so wasn't my taste at all. Plenty of luxury hotels located in beach front and an unpleasant beach experience, "
jeica8,"Seoul, South Korea",Sep 2014,"Nusa dua beach around Hyatt area was better than I expected.Bali beaches are not famous for blue water but Nusa dua beach was blue enough for me to actually go in.It is not Thailand or Malaysia blue but still much better than Kuta, Legian area beaches."
Cornelius Palm,"Vienna, Austria",Jul 2015,As the main beach is completely stuffed with luxury hotels it is not really possible to get a cosy place in the shadow. But the resorts are worth a look and it is interesting to walk next to all the 5 star hotels. If you go to your right hand side coming from the parking space and follow the pathway for around 500 m you can lay down under palm trees in the shadow. 
j01216,"Spa, Belgium",Aug 2015,Nice sand but dirty beach... Many massage center and bars.. Very quiet but the water is not deep at all..
sradha s,17 contributions,Aug 2015,"If you are coming to Bali for the blue waters, then Nusa dua is the place to stay. Stay in one of the resorts that have private beach. The beach towards swminyak, legion and kuta have become very dirty. Though there isn't much to do in Nusa dua, you could easily travel to the other beaches through radio taxis. These taxis are very easily available and run on meter basis, just download the app and your life becomes easy. Most of the hotels, restaurants and spas have pick and drop service so that also makes it very easy for a traveller."
wputri1991,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Aug 2015,It's a great beach to enjoy the water when it's on high tide. Not deep so recommended for kids or family.Not a sunset beach.Don't go when it's on low tide cuz the beach will looks dirty because of seaweed
AnnRoseC,"York, UK",Jul 2015,"beautiful sandy beach and clean (very, very salty) water! loads of water sports, nice bars & restaurants. "
stkaren1960good,"Oak Flats, Australia",Jul 2015,"Sand so clean and white.,Tractor cleans the beach every day.water so clear.The staff at Grand Hyatt wash all the  deck chairs on beach every day. loved all the lady's who sold cloths at beach so friendly."
Kris B,"Aylesford, UK",Aug 2015,Sorry not what we expected. The sea was warmer than where we were staying but full of rubbish. I would not swam or surf here if you paid me too. Bail beaches not living up to past expectations. Not many people here and no water sports which was a plus.
RMartinSDXB,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Mar 2015,"Basically no waves, a small beach but a really good place to relax, Nusa Dua doesn't have the party environment of Kuta but its has its own charm and personality. The place is not the cleanest (sadly) but its way cleaner than the west coast beaches. If you want a family environment, this might be your place...."
BlueSkyHolidayss,"London, UK",Aug 2015,"We went as a couple for a family wedding to sofitel nusa dua beach resort. Complete fairytale wedding treat. The resort has excellent hospitality,  superb fresh breakfast, high quality rooms and service's,  good wifi, good luggage storage, superb spa center, also has facility to hv shower after u hv checked out and u need to freshen up bf leaving fr airport. The hotel has shuttle fr local shops,the interior deco has superb wood work. Swimming in sea and pool is excellent too. My only suggestion as a visitor is that they shld organise the room numbers in a more organised way with a better number direction board on each floor. This resort is worth every hour and everyday. I recommend couples..family's or sole person to visit this resort..safe and relaxing beach. Complete relaxation resort."
Ken R,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"An expanse of clean white sand lapped by the ocean tides make this an ideal beach for a stroll along the sand or just reclining on the sun beds provided by several hotels which are adjacent to the beach. My children just love this beach because at low tide they can explore the rock pools for crabs and small fish and collect sea-shells.Not a good beach for swimming as just off-shore are several hazardous large rock outcrops, consequently there is no surfing or merchants selling souvenirs, drinks etc, which makes for a very pleasant and relaxing few hours.Several new restaurants have sprouted up in the area which provide a welcome midday and evening meal. Try the Bebek Bengil for a delicious crispy duck dinner at a very reasonable price."
Wilson C,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,"Whiter sands and a quieter beach, but the sand is not as silky soft as Kuta. Water is very clear. It's surrounded by posh hotels, so most stretches of the beach are ""private"" access through one of the hotels fronting the beach. Great for sunset strolls!"
Damiandecanha,"Krugersdorp, South Africa",Jun 2015,Great beach... We stayed at Club Med and had our own private beach which was well maintained. The beaches sand is awesome!
Gerri m,Australia,Jul 2015,"Nusa Dua Beach is a very loooong stretch of beautiful beach.Warm water, clean water and near all your water sports.I love the fact that you can litterly walk from one end to the other and look at some Amazing hotels along the way...stoppoing for refreshments as well."
stellabow,"Shanghai Region, China",Jul 2015,"One of the best beaches in Bali, it is also the most preferrable area visitng in Bali. Many five star hotels along the nusa dua beach and have their own beaches so guests can enjoy the time over here. very beautiful view. Sands are okay. Love the sunny blue sky with clouds, nice to have the picture. "
Bettina K,11 contributions,Aug 2015,"If you want to relax in luxurious, calm and relaxing surroundings I would recommend this place. Keep in mind the place is totally resorted but peaceful. Join the sunset!. And go to pirate bay"
YorkiePom,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,"Water colour is beautiful and blue, sand is golden, you can walk quite far out and it's still fairly shallow so great for kids...also no hawkers bothering you, no jellyfish, very relaxing...my only complaint is the litter. Walked into the ocean to see floating plastic carrier bags, juice cartons and chip packets....PLEASE put litter in the bins. I actually went down the beach collecting some litter in one of the plastic bin bags, a lot of the holiday makers just looked at me in amazement, litter is everyone's problem whether on Holiday or not!  A tractor goes up and down the beach at least 2 times per day raking the sand and the Grand Hyatt does send out a couple of guys who have big bin liners who try their best to pick up the smaller stuff.That aside it is a relaxing place to unwind and just around the corner at The Bay is a beautiful turquoise cove which is perfect for kids too. Would love to be back there now, sitting on my sun lounger under the shade of one of the trees."
Jon L,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Mar 2015,"Beautiful, clean, white sandy beach. The currents in the sea can be strong so children need to be watched."
Ann J,"Tamworth, UK",Aug 2014,Lovely beach to spend the day on. Sea is gorgeous and lots to do. Nusa Dua  very friendly place to visit. Eat at the Bali Collection for good quality food at a reasonable rate.
shytjan,Jakarta,Jul 2015,"Perfect place for a quiet getaway. Hear the sound of waves, feel the cool sea breeze. Fly a kite, build sand castle in the afternoon after sea water level subsides"
Margaret1942,"Limerick, Ireland",Jul 2015,It is a quiet well surpervised beach. Bus to bring you there and back which help when the sun is hot. Stand at the edge of the water and you are in heaven. The little restaurant is being upgraded but the drinks are cool and refreshing. Prices great. Oh to be there now. The white sand so clean and the water safe and clear.
MrMarkMrMark,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,"A beautiful beach, but each visit we notice it is becoming more and more about dollars, with beachside restaurants not wanting you to take your time eating and enjoying the scenery.The water quality is deteriorating with rubbish, so we didn't swim here, but it is a nice walk along the beach.We don't stay here any more as you are captive to your hotel, with only one small and expensive shopping center in the area."
DSS,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2014,"Nice clean beach, ideal for swimming and water sports.  Not all beaches in Bali give you this luxury."
Mickeymoo72,"Brighton, UK",Jul 2015,"So beautiful, great sand, clear water. Vendors are very friendly and respectful. Great place to spend a day."
Elif P,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2015,"Be prepared for the tide. There are times that there is no sea in the morning due to tide. We were there for a couple of days. There was wave at all times and water was not clear. Only the area at the left side of nusa Dua was more suitable for swimming, but such a small area. Yet the good thing is it is not crowded at all. Feels like private beach. At night it is such a boring place. Better to stay in Ubud and have a drive to Kuta for swimming."
AnnJo,147 contributions,Jul 2015,"No word can tell the beauty, must witness this place and will instantly take my breath away each time I come. Too bad it is commercialize heavily, and after a young coconut and a pizza, the bartender is not too happy if we keep the seat and do not order further....I come here for the view, the gentle breeze of wind, and the gentle pat of sea water waves on my feet, and to soothes my eyes from business letters & reports.....what a treat..  "
Sim E,"Timisoara, Romania",Jul 2015,"Even if the area itself it's nice and clean, the main disadvantage is that you have there low and high tide. For example, from 10 days, in 5 we had water in the sea only until 11 AM. In the next days we had until 12, growing up to 3-4PM in the 10th day. Not quite nice for a beach holiday. Also, there is full of venomous snakes that can be seen when the water is low. The remain in the lagoon. My husband saw one next to him even when when there was a high water level. "
colin s,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Our third time to Nusa Dua . A few traders , but lovely people and know when to leave you alone .An amazing spa , used it twice ! Safe swimming .dining on or beside the beach . We'll be back .‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚úàÔ∏è"
Nadeem B J S,"Lahore, Pakistan",Jul 2015,"It is quite and very good beach , you can go inside safely , rocks are also there . Water is clean , lot of water activities are there . Vs Thailand beaches ,it is better . For relax day it is good ,not very crowded ."
inostran,4 contributions,Jul 2015,"I stayed at the Laguna resort that sits on this beautiful beach and I can really say that it is worth a visit if you do not stay in the Nusa Dua area. The water is shallow, sand-based, calm and therefore swimmable. People complain that the water goes out due to the tide however how can you complain about something that occurs due to...nature? Beautiful, clean and well-maintained due to the number of resorts located along its walk!"
gsmock1967,"Jurong, Singapore",Jul 2015,"Not the cleanest, but far, far from the dirtiest I have been on. Very pleasant to walk along and enjoy the sea breeze and blue skies."
Camelia L,"Province of Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2014,"If you want to be amazed by the underwater nature and breathtaking views, you should take time for scuba! Plan your trip ahead and don't miss Lembongan. "
EleniYi,"Nicosia, Cyprus",Jul 2015,"Just a good beach mainly for surfing. EXCELLENT VIEW as in most of the beaches in Bali. Not as busy as expected. Kuta beach is much more attractive, busy and nice. TOP BEACH is the Seminyak Beach not Nusa Dua."
muchlishakim,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Quiet white sandy beach. Clear water, low waves, but watch for the rocks at some part of the beach. Surrounded by 5-stars hotels, restaurants and beach clubs. Not much visitor when I was there."
Kate S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,Clean white sand on this beach. Lots of large resort style hotels on this stretch of private beach. Kids clubs for children (and some adults). There was a good fun vibe on this section of beach. Some of the resorts do not allow visitors even for a bite to eat which was rude given that it is a private beach and locals do not have access. 
Payangan 1969,"Okinawa City, Japan",Jul 2015,Beautiful place to spend family time. Very clean and great places to eat. Head down there during sun rise and walk the whole bean to get a good feel of the place during this time of day. Also one can walk out when the tide is out. 
amirfakhry,"Tokyo, Japan",Jul 2015,"Im not expected to see the blue water! Should came earlier to swim here, the view is brilliant. Really recommended "
Moon moon,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"I love Nusa Dua beach for its relaxing ambience, so different with other beaches in Bali. All of them have its own characteristic, but Nusa Dua beach is very suitable for those who seek quiet and relaxing time on the beach."
Janto Widodo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"The view is superb , the white sand beach is so natural, and its not too crowd . But sometimes on holiday season we found some trash in the water that need to be cleanes up"
Maureen B,10 contributions,Jul 2015,"the security, the beach and gardens were impressive.A lot of traffic ,but to be expected due to holiday season. Watching your choice of taxi transport . Only used Bluebird as it is known to be metered .. "
Annabelle P,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Beach is very nice compared to Kuta. I do wish the rubbish was removed from the water but this is a problem all over Bali, such a pity for such a beautiful island."
Sentlenyana M,"Busan, South Korea",Jul 2015,"Firstly, there are better beaches to see in Bali. Nusa Dua beach has white sand and calm waters. The only issues for me were that most of the beach is taken over by high class resorts so it's difficult to find a spot where you can rent a chair and umbrella and chill out. Also, most of the restaurants along the beach front are super expensive and don't have a chilled, beach vibe. If you're close by, take a stroll along the beach but don't expect to be blown away."
DaisyO2014,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,Some areas are really beautiful and other areas you can not swim in the ocean. So do your homework if you want before you come. The stretch in front of Westin Sheraton is all great!!!
DcaliIII D,"Dallas, TX",Sep 2014,Best beach in Bali talking about pristine water it is just beautiful and a lot more organized than the otrer beaches in Bali..
delhiwalaNewDelhi,new delhi,Jul 2015,"Nusa Dua is very very good & neat and clean area developed very good. It has almost all the major top resorts hotels. But the best part is the big park with big statue. At the behind of this park there is a view point around the black reefs very dangerously spreaded around that area. There is a wooden surrounded view point, one can can see large blue colour sea with large waves striking these reefs making loud sound..Vinod TandonDelhi"
Sarafine,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2015,"Not too crowded, with a nice breeze.Some poisonous sea urchins too mind when entering the sea at low tide. Wear shoes."
8LavaLaguna8,"Bonn, Germany",Jun 2015,"The beach comfortable for swimming. In Bali lots of spots are nice but because of waves you can enjoy surfing only. Nusa Dua beach is exactly for families and for swim lovers. Water is clean, nice sand, no corals  "
Yianni K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"Great view, my resort had complimentary daybeds to use. Shopping opportunities from people walking on the beach and lots of water sports available."
w44566,"Taipei, Taiwan",Jul 2015,clean in the summer. not crowded. good for swimming and kids. long. very nice sand. very good for walking. romantic.
pchakravorty,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2015,"We stayed at the Marriot that had a private beach. The water was shallow and the beach were clean. Though, the water had a lot of rotting plants. We just relaxed under the shades and sipped through our drinks. Less crowd and distractions. It was a perfect relaxing getaway. You can read more about my Nusa Dua visit here. http://mumbaigloss.in/my-bali-visit-10-things-to-do-in-nusa-dua/"
Trey L,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Jun 2015,"This is one of the cleanest beaches I have visited in Bali, although depending upon the time of year and the wind you still can find trash in the water.  There are plenty of public areas to swim or let the little ones play, as well as, restaurants to eat.  Be sure to check out the Blow Hole at the tip of Nusa Dua beach during high tide."
Jack C,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,The beach is probably the cleanest beach in Bali because it is maintained by the resorts. At low tide the mini crabs all come out and are great fun to try and catch. 
Noviaa M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2014,"than another place, Nusa Dua is quite far from middle town. but if you need some private area, you can get much here"
Henry L,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2015,Nice clean beach. not crowdedBeach divided to area which own by the hotelRelaxing beach and nice to have a sunrise
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,A long stretch of beach with five star hotels and resorts. Not many visitors here except for those staying in nearby resorts. Nice for morning or evening walks. The sea is shallow and blue. Simply lovely.
Taissnow,"Concord, CA",Jul 2015,This beach is good for just laying out or renting a jet ski. I would not say it's swimmable. The area is just not as fun as some of the other beaches like Kuta and Jimbaran. It's mostly for those staying at the resorts and wanting the view of the beach when they are in their own pools.
Rells74,"Cranbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,Lovely white sand. Very swimmer friendly. Plenty of water sports to conduct. Reef keeps water safe for young swimmers. Plenty of sun lounges to relax on. Beautiful!
Susie L,Tasmania,Mar 2015,"Im not a fan of Bali, however, we stopped her on a cruise.  We went to Nusa Dua Beach.  It was quiet, beautiful and just the most amazing beach and sea you could imagine.  Really a treat.  Not at all like the rest of Bali. "
Neil G,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Jul 2015,This is a great beach and not surrounded by peddlers as many other beaches in Bali ..many of the major hotel are fronting this beach with many restaurants in the area ..a nice place to walk along and enjoy Bali for what it is .
abvira901,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2015,Clear crystal aqua waters. water sports are great. you can cycle the whole BTDC area. fantastic. Excellent place you will come agin and again
Barnacles70,"Medowie, Australia",Jul 2015,"I did not expect to find as pleasant a beach on this side of the coast. It's no good for surfing but for relaxing, swimming and enjoying the ambience it is very good."
Leogirl731,"Washington DC, DC",Jun 2015,"The beach was calm, and clear and not deep at all.  If you don't mind a little seaweed/sea grass, you'll enjoy.  "
Connectedness1970,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2015,It might be a case of location. location and location but it's been damaged by locals and tourists. Standing in knee deep water and plastic floats by is not attractive but to have disposable used nappies around your feet is a definite stomach churning moment.
Familytrips148,Singapore,Jun 2015,"A few of the adults in our group and young children tried the banana boat rides, jet skis and the para sailing. All of us had a great time. The operators were friendly and helpful."
lktraveller13,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"Lovely stretch of beach but the sand is very grainy and not easy to go for a long walk on.  There is a boardwalk but stops after the St Regis and then ""private properties"" afterwards.  Would love to see the boardwalk extended, then one could walk for km's."
djarot p,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,don't have a public beach...so i can see what kind beach that exist at the nusa dua area...please make a space for a public beach. 
Vincent H,"Saint Louis, MO",Sep 2014,"Wonderful beach. Full of 5 stars international chain hotels. Also in few strolls, we can visit galleria and nice Nusa Dua Hotel complex"
Manikandan1987,"Kozhikode, India",Nov 2014,"During my trip to Bali, i visited Nusa Dua beach. Very beautiful beach. I tried lot of water sports like Paracyling, Scuba Dive etc for the first time in my life. Must see in Bali"
Genniekeke,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2015,"Quite a nice and simple beach. Clean. But its mainly mainly touristy.I would say there is a simple corner where you can see the beauty of the wave, I was lucky to be following a group along. Good luck finding"
Andrew A,12 contributions,Apr 2015,"One of the nicest beaches we have been too, clear calm water nice and warm. Not a lot of people hounding you like in other parts of Bali. Cant wait to swim here again"
rowQld,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2015,Second visit within 12 months and Nusa Dua Beach is so beautiful with gardens everywhere and world class resorts to enjoy all year round.  
suzana b,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"Beautiful to look at but not a swimming or surfing beach. Not a calm beach that you can swim for hours, but also not a surfing beach. It is very shallow then it gets bumpy and deep very quickly. "
Krat64,"Avondale, AZ",May 2015,"Quiet beach and frankly, not very nice. I guess those two parts make up the whole.There are a number of small restaurants on the busy street which would be the best part of this area."
Sarinah C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"This is our 4th visit to Novotel Nusa Dua, Bali. We were very happy to stay there. The environment is friendly, comfy, and very nice for family. Kids love  the beach then from beach they move to the pool.  I myself and my husband love to shop balinese clothes,  dresses, shorts or jumpsuits. All of them are pretty with affordable price at shops beside the hotel. There are also many convenient stores around the hotel. If too lazy to walk outside the hotel, the foods in Square Rest  and cake shopp are yummy and delicious. They told us that their foods are free of MSG. Ooo my goodness... what a place.... then what I love too is their wash machine..  We just put out clothes inside..leave them for some hours.. taa..daa.. they are clean and almost dry... I need not worry about our clothes for stay any longer.‚ò∫Our love for Bali..Sarinah"
Zeeniek,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2015,"Great sport for surfing, there is a channel that will help surfers get out easier with little paddeling but be careful because around noonish the current gets stronger. I am a beginner and I was with the beginners group and I wouldn't have made it to shore if the trainers didn't help me by pushing my board. the current was sooo strong, i'd paddle with all my forces and still be where I am. ( the spot is also called mushroom)"
Syam52,AUSTRALIA,Jun 2015,"beautiful white sand, private beach, very few private venders with permits.  These can be a bit of a nuisance, but they seem to be aware that they cannot pester you.  The beach is private to each hotel and there are loungers available.  "
kapitibeach,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"We had access to this beach via the Novotel Nusa Dua.  It's a great beach.  Every hotel cleans their bit of the beach but you will see some areas that aren't clean and, as there are some major tides, there is a bit of rubbish on those sections.  The beach itself is very heathy with a few wee crabs zipping around avoiding big tourist feet.Now there is a side current that runs in the water.  The waves can be high, depending on which hotel's part of the beach you have access to.  Go after high tide and keep an eye on your kids as the waves do have a pull back.  Plenty of sunscreen, you can get burnt quicker with the sea salt eroding your sunscreen faster than at the pool.There are a few touts for shells, massage etc along the beach too, so not entirely private!"
zsszn,"Bratislava Region, Slovakia",Jul 2015,"After Kuta this beach is calm watered and relaxed without sellers on the beach. The water is clear, but maybe beacause of the weather, the sand is not so messy (I saw, the resorts clean it, but there are only few trashbins on the beach) and there are mainly tourist here, than the beach is ""free breathe"", not like in Kuta, where you are ""like sardines in the can"". "
robert,"Norwich, UK",Aug 2014,"Stayed in the Melia Benoa Hotel located on the Nusa Dua Beach, quietly watched the locals fishing without being stressed out by street traders or beggars which unfortunately are many in Bali, had to put up with ""dogsbollocks"" a local offering tour guides of Bali , which we declined"
Alejandro Lopez Pinto,"Tibas, Costa Rica",Jul 2015,"One of the best beaches I have ever been to, a very special place for children, highly recommended for families with small children"
JayeshVeralkar,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,"we had access to this beach strip through our hotel ayodya. since this is private beach strip, it is quiet and well maintained. "
Sonny_Waters,"Rochester, MN",Jun 2015,"We visited this beach while staying at Mahogany hotel, the hotel provided the free shuttle, and we were told besides swimming also to visit the two islands, we did go, one island a lot of locals bringing their pets ( dogs ) from different species, if you love dogs, you could see  they walk the dogs in this island, we also visited the rock where the swell hits and turned to the fountain. It was a lovely evening."
ColletteBeh,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2014,"Went diving with friends at nusa dua. Is a great place for first trial. I really enjoy and I love it so much! It was my first time, I was so nervous. But the guidance was great, they gave me some basic training and they really do look after me. Where to dive? Jimbaran Nusa Dua, Bali!"
Debasis_Saha,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Jun 2015,"it is very nich beach, white sand, sea water colour blue and crystal, you can see beach floor, nice to swim and do watersports here....."
Prashant M,"Mississauga, Canada",Feb 2015,"excellent sky blue beach, the water is clean and clear. right time to visit is in the evenings or early morning..."
Preston S,"Whistler, Canada",Jun 2015,We rented moto scooters in Jimbaran and took a drive over to Nusa Dua. What a surprise! After a long walk past all the five star hotels we stopped to check out haze beach club. The had a lunch promo so we spent the day. Best meal all trip!
Ace-KING88,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,Water was not as clear as I had expected and full of grass quite close to the beach.  Sand was not so fine and full of small pebbles / rocks / shells. Was quite quiet though and had a lot of space to ourselves. 
mark s,"Manchester, UK",May 2015,"Perfect beach and kept very clean. Nice to sit or walk around, very safe to swim in the sea. Plenty of locals selling everything you didn't need but ended up buying - good fun trying to bring a balinese boat kite all the way home on 3 different flights!"
RameshPMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,We enjoyed a variety of water sports. The most fun we had was on the Flying Fish. We did scuba diving too and the divers were all Padi certified.
Serena d,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,Nusa Dua's beachs are the best beaches in bali if you are looking to take a nice safe swim in crystal clear waters.  Unlike the beaches in Seminyak and Kuta there are no waves so it is safe for kids and people who are not great swimmers to wade in the waters and have fun.  Make sure you check it out for that tropical island feel.
wildanlatif,Bandung,Oct 2014,Overall beach and garden area were well maintained. Clean as you go on the way to the beach and in the beach. Spending the morning till noon with family at the beach side and enjoying water sport facilities that available unforgettable experiences in Bali. We stay at Conrad Bali beautiful suite room.
Bapu R,Dubai,Jun 2015,"side of Nusa Dua beach (south side) -- No thank you. Dirty, overcrowded, nosy, more like ""ballermann"" on Ibiza."
AhPek,Singapore,Jun 2015,"If compared to Kuta beach, this is much more quiet. I was there to view waterblow, Looks kind of dangerous but rather exciting to see water gushing out from rocks."
Rizby_2009,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2015,"Wide swathes of soft sands meets clear warm waters. Surf breaks majestically far offshore. This is the classic beach, perfect for walks and just chilling. Few vendors. However only luxury hotels line this beach. Did see some trash on the beach (visited June 2015) which seems to be washed onshore by the strong currents. But there are cleaners sweeping up everyday. Also quite a bit of seaweed. Would love to return!"
Pablo_Ir,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,Fant√°stic beach. Good quality of sand. Very quiet and fantastic to walk all along. There is also good spots for snorkeling. Currents are ok and there is not risk while snorkeling. There are many spots to rent equipment to practice many water sports. There are many nice hotels and there is a possibility to eat or drink at the many bars next to the beach. You ca also have direct access to Bali Vollection shopping gallery where you will find many shops and restaurants.
konahi78 T,"Kaiserslautern, Germany",Jun 2015,"Very nice beach!  Long, uncrowded, fairly clean water.  Although it could've been due to tides or costal conditions.  But then again, I come from Hawaii and we have some of the best beaches and worse.  Depends where you go too.  But I digress, Nusa Dua beach is very safe for kids as well as adults.  I'd go back again. "
Surya Tirtana,Indonesia,Jun 2015,"You should walk to one of the island, where locals bring their pets mostly dogs, and there is jogging track , too."
Pelf Nyok C,"Melaka, Malaysia",Jun 2015,"Nusa Dua beach was the first destination we were driven to on our first day in Bali. Perhaps it's due to the fact that we are Malaysians (there are plenty of beaches in Malaysia), and that our profession allows us to indulge in sea-related activities pretty cheaply (or for free), we found that the fees associated to all ""attractions"" offered by operators along the beach were very much inflated. We couldn't imagine paying $40 for what looked like a 10-15 minutes of parasailing. We certainly couldn't imagine paying $40 for a 15-minute of flying fish. Or $40 for ""walking under the sea with a head gear on.""As soon as we communicated our intention to ""just take a stroll down the beach,"" the tour operator told us that the beach was not safe for taking a stroll, and then she very quickly turned her back to us and started pursuing other tourists.In my opinion, it is a much overrated ""tourist attraction"" but if you're in Bali for its beaches and ""sea-sports,"" then this is the place to go to."
WMandAG,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jun 2015,"Novotel's Beach in Nusa Dua is a great place to chill, always clean sand and clear water - great food."
Namitasanjay,"Meerut, India",Jun 2015,It is a beautiful beach with many resorts opening on to it but it is well kept and clean.It is very peaceful and serene and amazing
460janined,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach was cleaner than most in Bali, probably due to the diligence of the area's resort staff. Don't expect to be able to relax at this beach, as the locals are relentless in their pursuit of a sale (or two). Good for swimming and snorkeling. On most days we visited there was a good small break to learn to surf on (that could have been good weather and tidal luck)"
adishjain87,"Noida, India",Jun 2015,"Nusa Dua undoubtedly is the best beach in BALI, Clean and Tidy and you will find all the luxurious hotels around it.WEST-IN, HYATT,  jw marriott, etc..If you wanna sit on a chair and relax, then you need to take a room in these hotels as they have seats close to beach designated only for residents of hotels.Take a walk early morning and it will rejuvenate you ! and beauty of the beach at its best !!!AS you go through the beach and nearby area you will see why it is favorite destination for US President BARACK OBAMA !!!"
VersatileVicky,India,Feb 2015,I have never seen something like this before. The resort has 2  beaches opposite each other . Where the hell do you get to see something like that .Check out moe about it and other videos on Bali and its attractions in my channel. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxCbQ2Kti8qRQ40zLjyMQCIlcl4GvhvTF
Trident18,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jun 2015,"We found a morning walk the ideal way to start the day. Even though we were on the path early we ran into cyclists and joggers also enjoying the sunrise. You can wander amongst  the beach areas of all the other resorts and enjoy seeing staff in preparation for the day. We found the beach to be fairly clean as most resorts employed gardeners and cleaners to maintain the common areas.It was also a thrill to see the areas on the beach being prepared for weddings... A perfect setting....sandy beach, sunshine and podiums decorated with curtains of chiffon and bunches of frangipanis and hibiscus.Allow a 30 minute walk before breakfast."
Little_miss_Chelsea,darwin Australia,Dec 2014,Bali beaches are not a post card expierence the pictures always look gorgeous but there is alot of rubish and annoying areas in Bali. Nusa Dua is aimed at the less drunk tourist and a touch more money. Great for watersports- if you call kite surfing and bannana boats water sports. Realy family friendly and no hawkers - nothing like the kuta beach expierence 
Saronthina,"Fuengirola, Spain",Jun 2015,"This is, by TA's forums consensus, one of the cleanest beach in Bali. Which pretty much says it all -  Bali's beaches are now for the most part detritus-filled. From the Hyatt all the way to Geger, you'll at best find spots of relative mediocre cleanliness between patches of what can only be called landfills. Floating used  diapers were so revolting we opted not to try the waters. note: The spots in front of the hotels are of course by far the better ones - but reserved for guests so if you are renting a villa you'll simply be out of luck. This is absurd - we're talking about a paradise-like natural formation absolutely ruined by the people who should be treasuring it, as tourism is by far the main source of income for the island. "
Travel Enthusiast,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2014,Beautiful clean beach for a quiet peaceful vacation. Lot of high end hotels and resorts lined up. Good place for a family get together. Away from the crowd for which bali is famous. Though away from busy bali there are options for food at decent walking distance.
Suzana M,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",May 2015,"Peaceful and enjoyable walking along the beach. Recommended for sunset...have to woke up early in the morning as early as 6.30am to see it. You feels safe as not too many people hang around the area. The beach current is quite strong, so there is a red flag, mans not suitable for swimming. I can see poeple do the exercising like joging, playing beach footall and just enjoying the environment."
DrSuz_12,"Ogden, UT",Jun 2015,"The beach is not crowded. It is easy to find solitude and enjoy the sound of the waves, which provide a natural music of their own. The view is spectacular"
Cheysa,"New York City, NY",Jun 2015,Beautiful clean beach aligned w/ westernized beach front hotels. Very relaxing aside from the locals selling souvenirs and tours.
Steffie681,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Apr 2015,"It was peaceful, perfect weather in april, relaxing. The tide gets really low around six so you can walk on the beach and see starfish, sea cucumbers, etc"
jona-mar-li,"Vienna, Austria",Jun 2015,"The Melia Bali Resort's beach, beach life and sportive options are excellent in all details, clean, beautiful and with an own beach-restaurant presenting indigenous and modern world cultures."
Mike A,7 contributions,May 2015,"A perfect place for romance, peace and love, enjoyed every moment and second of it.Excellent for couples and families."
Ferry T,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,This beach its good choice for your family. Dont forget to bring any trash to recycle bin . keep clean our beach..
GM-SBHB,"Tanjung Benoa, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Actually the Nusa Dua Beach is really large and consist of many region beaches, Nice for sunrise views."
doctorfoxtrot,"Taguig City, Philippines",Jun 2015,"This beach was not good for swimming during early morning and late afternoon hours. The surface area is quite extended that low tide is quite evident. I don't see people snorkeling or doing water sports activities except those flying kites. There is a pathway covering many high end resorts and you tend to encounter some vendors , several restaurants and those offering water sports activities. The best beach is located in the Sofitel resort area (forgot the name). This place is noted for its vaunted Balinese sunrise (not the sunset ) and it is worth waking up early past 6 am to witness and record it."
Nabil A,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2015,"The beach starting from Sofitel towards Bali collection is more beautiful, and is cleaner. All hotels (Sofitel, Nusa Dua, Westin, Laguna look to have same facilities, Sofitel offer much bigger rooms, and they are all a walking distance from Bal Collection "
ezjosa,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"Actually the Nusa Dua Beach is really large and consist of many region beaches, and what I'm going to do is reviewing the Mengiat beach which is a part of the Nusa Dua. The way to Mengiat beach is located between Inaya and Ayodya Resort. My visit was exactly quite late than I predicted before (which is to see the sunrise from the dawn), but it didn't matter because when I arrived the sun still in the halfway to rise completely and the view was still amazing anyway. After that, I enjoyed the morning beach atmosphere until 9 AM and playing with the sand. Not forget to mention, the beach is the type that I like because there was only few people here and you can really enjoy the beach, seriously!"
JGiuliani,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"Lots of space, soft sand, decent waves without being too big.  Local vendors are persistent and annoying so lacks the peace and quiet of a private beach."
Rob S,"Churchdown, UK",Jun 2015,Don't bother trying to snorkel as the water is very cloudy through sand disturbance. It is a very clean area to be as the hotels that sit on the beach have regular clean up crews. 
Peter M,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"just a wonderful place to walk along the beach, do look beyond the rubbish. water is clear and mostly calm for a swimyou can get to most hotels and shopping from the beach"
Deriardi,"Semarang, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Bali one of the island in indonesia, which are well known in the world as the island godsbesides high cultural activity, bali also has a stunning nature, If you are planning a trip to bali for summer holiday, this beach is highly recommended.with beautiful white sands beach, crystal water, blue sky, and stay in luxurious resort around this area will be an incredible experience in bali,mengiat beach location semenanjung Nusa dua, Nusa Dua is a major international enclave containing a 5 star resort in southeast Bali. Located 40 kilometers from Denpasar, besides you relax, around 10 minute drive from Nusa Dua bay you can also do a lot of water sports in Tanjung Benoa, best season to visit bali or indonesia I recommendation between April till August .happy summer holiday ... !!!"
metalaarif,"London, UK",Jan 2015,"I didn't stay that long in this beach and the reason I didn't book a hotel this area was because of me traveling in rainy season. I was under impression that rain would ruin the beach but what happened was that it didn't rain. The beach was really awesome and had great food (Nasi Goreng) and best of them all I did Jet Ski which was really great. This was my 2nd time to try Jet Ski and I need to be honest, I was more confident and I could drift my Jet Ski. However, please do remember that you do a background research on the price, these guys were offering me all sorts of water sports in DOLLAR rate which was rather expensive then local rate. Anyways beware, I am sure you can find these water sports in way more cheaper rates."
Cheryl S,25 contributions,May 2015,I liked the sidewalk that extended up and down the beach--for those of us who like a smooth walk.  lots of restaurants and shopping to choose from.
Isabella Devich... W,9 contributions,Jun 2015,"The resort is so good, but when I came there, the sea is receded so I can see the trash in the waterfront. Because of that, I didn't want to play on the ocean, just in the beach."
Pina W,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"We walked along the path of this beach nearly every day during our stay at Nusa.  It's wonderful to walk past mostly in the shade and see all the other resorts as well.It is very picturesque and seeing all different nationalities enjoying the beach is really great.You don't get as pestered here by vendors as much as you do at Kuta or Legian, in fact they are quite subdued so you do actually get to enjoy the beach.We were lucky enough to enjoy dinner from one of the resorts on the beach and it really is a nice thing to experience.It can get busy with people but the scenery is so relaxing, so do it."
Hui Yi N,Singapore,Jun 2015,"We had to pay a toll fee to visit this beach. It was clean and awesome. Soft white sand and clear water good for swimming.Water was cool, calm and inviting. Compared to kuta and legian beaches, come here if you would like to take a breather away from other beaches."
mikemada,UK,Jun 2015,"The beach has a deep fall and at low tide it leaves lots of pools. Not sure how safe it is as there are mentions of sea urchins, so wear those flip-flops! There are sea turtle nests which are protected, so it would wonderful to be around as the babies surface later in June/July "
AnitaMikalsen,"Tromso, Norway",Aug 2014,This is one of the most lovely places I have been too - we really enjoyed our time at Nusa Dua in Bali :)
fatpats,manchester,May 2015,"The beach was clean and tidy,Beware of the hawkers on the beach. They can be a bit of a nuisance especially if you try to buy just one item they push to try and get you to buy more.  Just say no from the start."
AdiDhe,"Bengaluru, India",May 2015,"I like the beach, very clean and secluded. Few more food and beverages options would be helpful, and water sports can make it  more attractive"
Julia M,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"I came to Nusa Dua when I was a kid and it was the most amazing beach I'd seen. Blue water, coral five steps into the water. 15 years later, it's terrible. Rubbish and seaweed have replaced the tropical fish that were there. I asked a local what happened and he said, what do you expect, there are so many hotels here now. It was an eye opener to think the clean, bleached sheets I love to get into are also destroying the beautiful beach that once was. "
Shin I,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2015,"The beach is very quite and peaceful compared to those others beaches in Bali. However, the only downside I have to point out is that the beach is full of seaweed.Even though there are people who are taking away the seaweed and stuff, but the amount of it just seems so much that it actually starts become bothering."
Alpfrance,"Paris, France",Aug 2014,Just a beautiful beach plenty of tourists and five stars hotels. Everything is expensive and really not autentic.
Veganlia,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2015,"I went to Nusa Dua for the day , as I walked out to the Pier and looked behind me , I was a bit confused on all the holes in the sand to add trash which consisted of seaweed and plastic which eventually was covered again with the sand . I wonder if this practice is common ? Does Bali have a recycle program ?"
Alberto S,"Vigo, Spain",May 2015,Not many people. Peace and quiet. Fully recomeneded if you are looking for to remove stressfullness from your mind.
The dust of my footsteps...,"London, UK",Jun 2015,"Make sure you hit it for high tide otherwise you won't see the fame geyser effect. A nice stroll if you're staying in one of the nearby hotels. Might get crowded. and no place to sit really so don't make it a big outing point, you'd be disappointed. Not worth a taxi ride as far as I'm concerned, unless you have young kids in your party who'll be mesmerized."
dannyvicki,"Margate, Australia",Jun 2015,This is an area you should never miss if you come to Bali it is beautiful. Their are gardens which are beautiful and full of the most beautiful orchids. To get into the area of Nusa Dua you have to go through a security check which is reassuring and it is a very family friendly place to spend time. There is a blowhole type thing down at the rocks area which people fish from and people get their photos taken when the blowhole works. It is best at high tide. Beautiful area. 
Alisha S,5 contributions,Jul 2014,It's really pretty but a little bit of rubbish washes up on shore which is sad. Look after the land tourists and Bali folk :) 
Deborah,"Nottinghamshire, UK",May 2015,liked the very clean beach. The fact it was on the hotel doorstep. Absolutely nothing to dislike. Free sun beds with parasols. Also water sports if you felt energetic.
Ashupoddar,"Varanasi, India",Dec 2014,"Although we stayed in Westin Resort which has a private beach, It was very clean and a lovely beach."
marianne j,"Oxfordshire, UK",Dec 2014,"Beautiful white sandy beach, full with hotels and all inclusive resorts.  That was our first visit in Bali.  Nusa Dua is a little bit quiet for us, but he nicest beach in Bali."
VineetChhajer,"New Delhi, India",May 2015,"Had a Wonderful time here.. Loved the Breeze and Watching the Sunset. It is Easy-Going and wasnt Crowded or Overtly Busy, An Evening Stroll here is Very Nice. The Sea Temprature was just right to Swim.Really enjoyed it"
Keith_KL,KL,May 2015,Went there during my recent stay for the first time.  It's a good beach for kids as the sand is clean and the wave break far out so they are pretty small when getting to the coast. 
Vebi-Guniawan,Indonesia,Apr 2015,"the most part of beach is cover by the hotel and resort.not many people around the beach, so if you are people who like quite and good sunbathing, this is the place for you."
Shayne B,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,Beautiful white and clean beaches and not too many vendors selling their wares. Lounges are set on the manicured grass. Bar on the beach as well as a pool
352nick777,"Jurmala, Latvia",May 2015,"Romantic,100% quiet, your heart/mind has been set at rest. Already 5 years I'm wondering this very special place between the Heaven & Earth..."
JuliavHitalktravel,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2015,a nice area to walk along and swim due to its cleanliness and minimal locals pressuring you to buy from them. safe and easy with children.
mrswaves,Maryland,May 2015,"The beach is nice..some areas rocky, some areas smoother. Lots of corals and rocks that come up during low tide. The water is warm and clearer around various areas. Find a spot you like and set up there! :) "
CliveNightingall,"Bull Creek, Australia",Jun 2014,"obviously the whole stretch of beach is privately controlled so no one apart from resort patrons are there. Took the kids on the kayak provided by the resort, had a few cocktails before the short stroll back to the resort proper"
Suzanne M,"Glasgow, UK",May 2015,This beach is not really for people that like swimming in the ocean/sea.  Its a long stretch of beach and I can honestly say that the best part of the beach/sand is where the Laguna Hotel is.  They have buoys very close to the shoreline so you cant really swim into deep water as its very rocky.
421wheretonext,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2015,Clean white sand and beautiful blue water.Balmy breezes and warm sunshine! Good food at both the Sofitel Resort and Nusa Dua Beach Resort
IndiTraveller15,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2014,Beautiful beach to relax and laze in the sun with a  cool refreshing drink. Can get hot in afternoon and  early evening. Can have a short swim and splash in water.
lynWollongong,wollongong,May 2015,Nusa Dua Beach is stunning. Lots of restaurant options along the beach and very clean area. Beach is pristine and perfect for swimming and relaxing. 
Kurt T,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,Awesome place for the family to relax. Not too crowded and the sand is perfect. Great place to have a nice walk with the family
Andrew M,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,Quite beach with lovely white sand and clear water - terrific for kids. Water quality is excellent.Backs on to most of the best Hotels and Resorts in Nusa Dua.
travelbunny0306,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2015,I really love the beach in Nusa Dua - calm and clean. And not over crowded with people and not bugged by anyone to buy anything.Suitable for kids to play in.
Carolanddiane,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,So relaxing and very comfortable loungers to lay on and just enjoy the beutifull sound of the sea also the food and cocktails were great and very friendly survice so lovely to get away and relaxe
Singlesolotraveller,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,"A beautiful beach, unfortunately the water was a bit dirty,too many plastic wrappers in the water.   Disappointing"
alexsohsg,Singapore,May 2015,This is a great place to take photos. Love the color of the water and sky. The sea current is so strong in the afternoon and the wave is just magnificent!
anupam s,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2014,"Surrounded by hotels across the island, the beach is a n escape for every single hotel guest. But if you stick to your part of the hotel, you can have a serene exp without doubt "
Marcus F,Aberfoyle Park,May 2015,"Great beach, very clean. Has a walking path between beach and the resorts that stretches from Tanjung Benoa to the north to the Hindu temple to the south. About 15km all up.Good for a walk, plenty of places along the way to grab a beer or massage. Very little hassling from locals. Outer reefs stop swell so great swimming for kids. Some good surf breaks on the reefs.Escape the west coast hustle and give the Nusa Dua side(east coast) a try"
Purplepinay,"Paranaque, Philippines",May 2015,I am spoiled by Philippine beaches so my standards are high.  Boracay and Palawan rate as 5 (excellent).  Many other Philippine beaches are 4.  Nusa Dua beach is a 3 and a half.  The sand is clean and a pale yellow.  But it is loosely packed and therefore very difficult to walk on.  The waves were quite strong so it is not the type of water that I would leave small children in.  Sunrise on this beach can be very pretty.  Sunset is not visible from this side of the island.
Ayesha H,"Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, India",Apr 2015,Dirty when low tide. We preferred swimming in the property pool. Though it's perfect for sun bathing.
Warnasouda,Paris van Java,Oct 2014,"Very true you choose Nusa dua beach as clean and beautiful.Beside stepping straight sand, can also walk or run on tracks along the edge of along beach..Pedistrian track that is protected by trees, also some security officers who guard, so you can enjoy the beauty without fear of safety hazards.."
Sara S,120 contributions,May 2015,Loved everything food great waves super awesome costumer service location quietness n clean beach I could find everything close Transport not an issue at all
Ketaki J,4 contributions,Apr 2015,we did sea walk herehere u have many water sports and adventures options availablegreat lifetime experience of sea walk 
Mai L,6 contributions,May 2015,"I was expecting the beach to be white sand and cleaner.... Its not, so for those who are travelling here for the experience of a beautiful beach, I suggest to do some research for better beach areas."
OTIS W,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2015,"Nusa Dua has two beaches, one is for public ( sometimes rubbish flowing on water) and the other is under the management of various resorts. The Bay--- with Bumbu Nusantara, Hong Xing, Pirates Bay Bali and Ocean Walk lining along the shady trees. The security guards, with smiling faces, greet the visitors blandly. The whole area is famous for renowned hotels, the room rate of course is expensive indeed, and you can easily find a large range of water sports here. Bali Collection has an excellent shopping mall, and she frequently provides a free ride to your hotel within the area."
Vicki C,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2015,Although the usual hawkers were at this beach they were very nice and didn`t get pushy. They are all liscenced and numbered. the beach is edged with beautiful shady trees and some days enough surf if you want that.
Debdutta S,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,Great for cheap water sports - most popular water sports destination in Bali. You can bargain against the quoted rates here as well - just like for everything else in Bali 
MaiDreamsComeTrue,"Sukadana Ilir, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"The water is not wavy, the sand is pulpy cute. not as crowded like the west part of the island (kuta). If you are bored, maybe look around for water sports that is suitable for calm water, such as jet skiing, snorkling, canoing."
Hayley N,"Hertfordshire, UK",Apr 2015,private beach with waiter service which is always an added luxury! the bar and outside restaurant are right on the beach so you can eat right on the beach with lovely views. The pool is a stone throw away from the sea so perfect setting. The wow factor are the tropical gardens that this the hotel is set in and makes a perfect place if you are looking for some chill time and a good base to discover Bali from  
Dankyboy,Waikiki,Jan 2015,"Very peaceful, never crazy crowded, a lovely beach for swimming and sunning!  Soft sand and fun little restaurants.  Great for walking and exploring."
Renee S,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2015,"No path along entire beach for bike rides, nice sand, great clean water that is calm when the tide goes out, just loved swimming here, amazing corner of the earth"
intrepidus2000,"Shanghai, China",Sep 2014,its a nice beach area.  Never felt crowded.  Nice sunrise view on the beach with low tide.  Its worth waking up a little early for.
425darren,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2015,The street sellers will want some of your hard earned in exchange for a sarong or a kite. Its a lovely beach but coral washes in so watch your feet if your going to take a dip. 
Maymay1989,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2015,"The beach here is pretty clean compared to others around Bali. The resort staff do their best to tidy it up. Everyone is polite and friendly. If you're not staying at one of the resorts by the beach here, you can still hire beach chairs available to the general public. Not too many hawkers and a gentle 'No thank you' is sufficient for them to leave you be. Toilets and a beach shower are also available."
knitchic,"Yanchep, Australia",Dec 2014,"I always enjoy a walk along the beach, its peaceful and no hawkers hassling you to buy anything.  Very pleasant experience."
KeithCarr-Glynn,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2015,"One of the best features of Nusa Dua is the lack of hawkers trying to flog timeshares or sunglasses.  Although not a lot to do, the beach is very pleasant and there is a huge shopping centre nearby."
stirlinggoose,"Taipei, Taiwan",Apr 2015,The beach is clean with great view if you want to find a peaceful beach this will be your good choice. 
sunir78,Singapore,Apr 2015,Did parasailing at Nusa Dua with my daughter and wife.Great experience in that the one where we went via boat into the ocean and did parasailing was amazing... Did it in tandem with the wife & kid and the three of us had an amazing time.Do haggle with the operators as they mark up the price.Take either your mobile phone or a pocket camera to take photos when on the boat (you can ask other people who are also doing the parasailing to take photos for you).This is because operators will sell you photos that have been taken. But these photos are only 4R where as we were expecting more like 6R considering other attractions such a Bali Zoo etc give those. It wasn't properly advertised (one small note on an obscure window).You also get asked to buy 10 photos if you want the soft copies which is again a problem. A disappointing note to the parasailing experience but one that was still amazing.
barking1RedondoBeach,Redondo Beach,Apr 2015,"AS beaches go in Bali this one is probably the best. My third trip to Bali so knew already that it does not have the greatest beaches, but that is only a small part of what makes the island so great. The water is warm, clean, has some trash around, nice that it is not big waves, is tidal so expect shallow water quite a way out. Good place to be close to many other hotels and their facilities."
Sue P,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,"If you would like a lovely walk along the beach there is a tree lined pathway passing some of the very affluent hotels of Bali.  You can enter the beach walk near Bali Collections shopping centre and view the calm waters of the bay on one side and the beautiful gardens of hotels on the other,  there are soo some lovely hotel restaurants overlooking the beach where you can stop for a beverage or a meal."
Suncica1,Zagreb,Apr 2015,"In late March and beginning of April the sea temperature was 28 degrees Celsius, you can not really cool off. The sun is extremely strong, and even with sun-block, one can easily burn. The water is shallow and you can walk all the way up to the laguna reef, do bring you water shoes, the corals are rather sharp in places. Nicer for watersports and just lying on the beach than for swimming. "
Thanapatana-OOH,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2015,the surfer might like it. the good things are that there are not much of the merchants or vendors wandering around.
NUG2015,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Excellent place to walk and get exercise in the morning.  It's quiet, not crowded.  You can also see the sunrise if it's not cloudy.  "
nwk,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Clean and clear blue sea, great for kids - lots of watchful eyes along the shoreline. Only downside was when the tide went out, you were left with the seaweed and muck."
Still_Just_Relaxin,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,We stayed in Nusa Dua in October 2014. Visited the Nusa Dua Beach hotel and Spa. Great resort which goes all the way to the Nusa Dua beach. The beach is wide and clean. it runs along the back of several resorts and they keep it clean. You don't seem to get the beach pedlars like the beach in Kuta. Sitting on this beach in the late afternoon with the breeze coming off the sea while enjoying a nice cold drink is a great way to wind down.
Jlong42,"Long Beach Island, NJ",Apr 2015,"Beach is great. We went parasailing and dive walking, and then visited the turtle farm. Worth checking out for all the watersport options. Staff are so helpful and fun."
BattlestarBerry,"Berry, Australia",Apr 2015,"Coming from Australia, it is very hard to find better beaches than our own, but Nusa Asia beach in front of the resorts is very clean as they sweep it daily. During our stay it was calm and Touqoise.. The Indonesian boats and fishermen using traditional rods adds a charm we don not have in Oz. "
superstar0307,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2015,one of the best beach of the bali island perfect for relax restaurant are available shower parking all facility expected  
Katie P,"Bunbury, Australia",Apr 2015,"Safe, secure and clean! conveniently accessed from beach front hotels, we stayed at the Sofitel which offered 1st class access and views!"
Sizzlingshaz,"Reading, UK",Mar 2015,"Private beach by the hotel was so clean, comfortable beds and waiters on hand for your every need! Great restaurants on the beach - although a little expensive."
kebaliin,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Located around The Grand Hyatt, Ayodya, and St Regis Hotels, and hosts the beach club for the Amanusa.The beach is protected by an offshore reef, breaking waves which heading to the beach, so the water is relatively calm and very suitable for swimming or playing water.The beach can be accessed easily, without having to stay in one of the hotels available.There is plenty of free parking for cars or motorcycles and managed independently by local villagers called Segara Yasa.This beach was not a prefect spot to snorkeling or diving, but it is an ideal place for sunbathing and spend time reading a book with a background of the sound wavesthere are restaurants that offer food is quite tasty at affordable pricescan also encountered traditional masseurs masseuse-ready massaged with traditional techniques"
helenvyse,"Norfolk, UK",Apr 2015,I was surprised to find that the beaches in Bali by no means compare to those in Thailand and the Philippines but this was the best of them! White sand and clear sea but the sea contains a lot of seaweed which can get rather irritating. Also the sun loungers for use by the public or all clumped together in one spot rather than being spread out along the beach which is preferable to me.
colbert,australia darwin,Mar 2015,"The Weston just has everything we love. -great room, bathroom, bed huge, linen superb, and pillows the best.  Great restaurants and plenty to choose from.  Heavenly  bed on the beach money well spent.  Staff all great."
tvalentius,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2015,The view on this beach is fantastic and also it's quite reachable from Denpasar city using Sarbagita Bus.
ManojSogani,jaipur,Mar 2015,"its a long stretched beach from one corner to another touching a lots of hotels all connecting with each other, water sports, swim available at all time, looks real good"
PollyAlex1,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Aug 2014,The beach was full of trash! They cleaned it up but the workers just buried the trash in the sand....what happens during high tide???? I'm not sure why they did that but I didn't swim in the sea after seeing the amount of trash just floating around. Great to look at though...gorgeous blue colour
SmartGirlBali,"Gili Trawangan, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"Calming and serene, Nusa Dua Beach is possibly the best beach in Bali.  Water is clean and clear with nice waves that break out on the reef.  Very relaxing and peaceful.Bathrooms available.There is food and drink available as well as beach towels and chairs.  Nice loungers.  Totally worth the money!Watch the surfers a little ways out and let the kids enjoy the swimming.Beautiful!  I would loved to have spent more time here."
Adityo Dwi,Jakarta,Mar 2015,"stayed in the Novotel, their Beach is not connected to the hotel but is beautifully secluded, next to St.Regis. hotel shuttle to the beach is available every 20 minutes or so"
Punyadeep S,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2015,Probably the best beach in Bali. Pristine water and so calm. Nice place to relax and spend the day sun bathing.
Sylvia315,"Atlanta, GA",Mar 2015,"This beach is beautiful and so big! It is wonderful to sit out on this lovely beach and watch the waves break out on the reef which makes the water from the beach to the reef very calm. The beach was empty except for a very few people! Our lounge chairs at the St Regis Bali were the most comfortable I have ever had the opportunity to be in. There was a surfer's beach a little bit away from where we were located but there were boats waiting to take the surfers and their boards to the location on the reef that had the best surfing. The St Regis had beach attendants who were happy to help you with your beach towels, serve you a drink, bring you cool towels and water, serve you lunch or snacks or just about anything you needed! It was a wonderful experience each day. I would recommend a week as we were there five days and wish we had a few more!"
Jeff B,"Stoke-on-Trent, UK",Mar 2015,Nothing to dislike about this location. This is the most relaxed place I have ever been to. The beach is long and clean and had plenty of trees in which to sunbathe under
Otilia Maria K,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2015,This beach has the best waves and the cleanest water by far. One can walk along the beach for quite a while and just relax and enjoy the sound of the waves. 
madhav r,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2015,"I like the beach view and shaded chairs to relax. excellent views. shallow water. be prepared to be welcomed by lots of sea weed, its kinda irritating, you definitely dont like to swim there for long....I am not sure its like this every day or only the day we visited. open shower facility available... "
Mjames026,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Mar 2015,The area is quite clean and the beach has a great opportunity to find shells in the morning. The water is refreshing and calm. Great views of surfers in the distant.
mansanasjuana,Philippines,Jul 2014,Pretty and lively! Not much to dislike. Nice water temperature and clean. Nice to stroll along the path and check out the other hotels on offer.
Jules0986,"Munich, Germany",Jul 2014,"Beach is ok as hotels clean it regularly but the water is a bit dirty (plastic bottles, etc.). Otherwise there are a lot of hotel restaurants and bars to visit - also the small island is worth a trip (nice view)."
Challes S,53 contributions,Aug 2014,"Stroll around in the morning, you can walk across while the water is shallow.. In the afternoon the water is rising.. I prefer the morning walk, its very beautiful and the sand is very clean."
Jameseriano,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"I love this Place....Clean with the beautiful view it's really good for enjoying time with your friend or lonely just take a time.i must come back when i back to bali, it's really great memories"
DavidAdventures,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2015,"Resort's beach was well maintained, and rather empty.  Water was perfect, and the sand is nice to lie in or just walk around on."
Simone B,"Mona Vale, Australia",Dec 2014,"We thought the water would be clean, but were disappointed with the amount of trash in the water. Plus the local hagglers did not give up!"
Mohit088,"Bengaluru, India",Mar 2015,"The beach needs cleaning. The best part is at night, the beach is mostly deserted, hence can go on a long walk, sit back, relax, and talk."
ginarti,Jakarta,Feb 2015,The complex of Nusa Dua beach is surrounded by a beautiful and large garden. I really like to walk arround in the evening or just sit looking at the sea.  the left beach is covered by white sand. There is water blow on the edge of the garden
o_galinko,"Moscow, Russia",Feb 2015,"the beach is clean, white sand and no waves.Rest only tourists, not local people.Tides in the afternoon, in the morning and in the evening you can swim"
Yvette,64 contributions,Feb 2015,"Really relaxing environment, I loved the pool and that the beach is a few steps away. Good amenities withing the hotel. It is in an exclusive area so don¬¥t expect you can walk your way out to downtown. There is a nice shopping center available for all hotels, take a shuttle that passes by every hour. Not a lot of party, bars and restaurants are closed by 11 pm. Breakfast is so delicious, still dream about the pain au chocolat. "
Fireyredspring,22 contributions,Mar 2015,"Good place to enjoy the water jet ski, flyer, banana boat, paragliding and etc.. and it doesn't come cheap."
RSN2011,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2015,"Great place to hang, not so deep. visited from my resort which had great relaxing chairs and bed along this beach. Go for Sunrise."
Thiamchye T,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,"The Nusa Dua beach is a lovely exclusive enclave fronted by many 5 star hotels.  During the high tide, the water is a lovely turquoise sahde of green.  With beach chairs provided by the hotels, each with its own perimeter boundary, it is easy to spend a relaing day by the beach.  Local massuers are on hand if one needs a massage on the spot and some hotel provide a nice pavillion for the massage too."
MadamVoyageurs,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2015,"Private and nice beach, you can find water sports but if the smell from those engine is terrible, it's a beach where u can find privacy & luxury"
Calder Angus T,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,A beautiful and safe beach that is constantly kept clean through out the day with access to numerous restaurants and activities.
expaddy,Bali,Feb 2015,"If you like to swim in the ocean, this beach offers very safe and unadventurous swimming areas.  You can't venture past a hotel's roped swimming areas unless you don't mind risking getting run over by a jet ski.    But if you are that guy who wants a jet ski, parasail, banana boat, etc, this can be a good place to rent and play.  The beach itself is big and doesn't allow hawkers to wander around pestering people (unlike the sprawl of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak etc).  This is a place of quiet.  Dawn can be lovely here, and it's possible to walk, jog or cycle for long distances. There can be excellent views to Peneeda island, Gunung Agung volcano and sometimes if you're lucky you can even see the summit of Lombok island's Mount Rinjani.  I generally think of Nusa Dua as having big family oriented resorts.  While the rest of Bali is always within reach by private tour or driver, this area feels secluded and exclusive. "
Nandha d,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2015,this beach a bit quite in the morning but very crowded at afternoon. Its a good place to jogging or doing beach activity. the wave not big.
Phil S,"Shanghai Region, China",Jan 2015,Nice beach and nice weather. The hotel is also good. Our family had wonderful time there. We hope go there again someday. 
Rony Soerakoesoemah,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"The beach still remains exclusive so nice to walk around without being hassled ... swimming still not an option in these parts, can get bit dangerous... pleasant spot to enjoy sunrises and sunsets...always a treat to bring family for those getaways..."
joyissac,"Vadodara, India",Feb 2015,"This is a good beach to relax down with a lot of restaurants and high class resorts on the side. If you are looking for water sports this would be the best place to be. But beware that there is no waves on this beach so if you like to take a swim on a rough beach or do some surfing , this is not the right place"
–î–∏–Ω–∞—Ä–∞ –ù,7 contributions,Feb 2015,"I like going to the beach, swim in the ocean. But maybe because February is not a season, that's why ocean was a little bit dirty."
lnbtravels,"Seaford, DE",Feb 2015,"We found it strange that the beaches in Bali -- Kuta beach, Jimbaran Bay -- were not that great, especially for swimming. There is always lots of seaweed or garbage and the waves are rough. Nusa Dua beach is a bit better -- the basin in front of the beach gets filled up with calm water at high tide (which occurred around noon when we visited in February 2015) and it's nice for swimming at high-tide. The beachfront cabanas are usually reserved for specific resorts, so it's easiest to enjoy the beach if you are staying at a resort. We were at The Grand Bali Nusa Dua and had to take a shuttle to get to their reserved area of the beach."
Matti O,"Helsinki, Finland",Feb 2015,"One of the best beaches in the world. Beautiful, tranquil, clear water, white sands. I love this place. "
j_zsag,18 contributions,Feb 2015,"The problem is there,that the big part of the beach is belobging to one of the big hotels,and You can't easily find a place for Your towel,without not to have discursion with a security guard,who will send You away.But a free shuttle service/Bali Collection Bus/is a big help for everybody."
Georgia H,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Believe it or not its hard to find a nice beach in Bali but Nusa Dua has a lovely clean beach. No waves just crystal clear water and white clean sand, not like Seminyak which has dirty dark sand. Truly plesant to sun bake and swim in. Going again in March."
Petros I,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"stunning beach, especially when calm and when the tide is high so one can swim for hoursclean, wide, yellow-sand beach with beautiful gardens behind and some shade by nice trees"
Michael Z,"New York City, NY",Jan 2015,The beach at the Grand Hyatt is absolutely beautiful and clean.  There are a lot of trees that provide shade.  No lifeguards so be careful of the high waves.
cathylakwatsera,"Manila, Philippines",Feb 2015,"This is by far the best beach in Bali after visiting several other beaches. First, there's not a lot of people and looks like you have the beach all by yourself, great place to relax and get tanned. When we went there, the waves are not that strong so swimming is ok... the beach is also clean and not a lot of sellers to harass you."
Katattack2013,"Coolangatta, Australia",Feb 2015,"Unless you are staying at a resort in Nusa Dua, you CANNOT access any of the beach areas!!!We went to the jetskiing and parasailing here, as we were staying in Legian, and not only was it was VERY EXPENSIVE, but the water was so dirty we didnt event go for a swim!!!!.. When I asked our driver to take us to another beach, he said ""Oh thats not possible, you have to be staying at one of the resorts to access the beach""!!!!! Now thats RIDICILOUS!!! This area is too far away from Kuta, Legian or Seminyak at least a 45 min drive, so definetly OVERRATED!!!Don't bother staying here, its much better in Legian or Seminyak!!"
SandyKash,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Feb 2015,"Went their in feb 2015, had an amazing time at the beach, lovely shops around at beaseach with nice balineese food. One of the most cleanest and beautiful beaches in bali. Love the golden sand and the temple atop a small cliff. Love the road around the beach to walk hand in hand. A must go place in your itinerary. Dont miss it , go at the evening time"
ANtrvlbug,"Taipei, Taiwan",Dec 2014,Fabulous restaurants and shops...bought a few dresses at very economical prices!! There were restaurants catering to different tastes. We particulary loved the Japanese Restaurant Hanabi which had incredible food that had us coming back. We also loved the Indonesian cafe Coco bali. Really good Nasi Goreng here!!
Hartimage,"Boise, Idaho",Feb 2015,"We stayed near here with the Courtyard Marriott for two nights, and walked to the beach to get some sun and rent paddle boards. Paddle board rentals were super cheap ($15/2 hrs), and it was fun, but the tide was going out, so the waves were quite small by mid afternoon. The trash in the water however...When you are on a surf or paddle board, the first thing you notice is all the plastic bottles, bags, and wrappers just floating on top of, or hovering just under, the surface. The water is beautiful, blue, and warm - it's just too bad that it's also the garbage disposal. I will say, however, that Bali is progressing in its awareness of trash and ocean conservation. It is much farther ahead than other islands in Indonesia. It is just going to take some time. I'm sure that a lot of the trash bags we picked up off the beach could have been perhaps 10 years old.The beach itself was quite clean, as most of the beach frontage is manicured by various hotel staff. We did have a very nice time there, drinks in hand, with nice soft beach chairs and umbrellas."
RVTCosta,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Dec 2014,very quiet not crowded and with full of chairs provided by hotels everywhere. Water clean but not for diving or snorkeling; calm waves; not cold. Nice and clean sand.
Marilyne1,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,"Amarterra Villas Fantastic place. Staff couldn't do enough for you they even changed menu for me with dishes I could eat. Always greeted by all staff. Rooms spotless and well looked after, grounds beautiful and well kept. Would recommend the villas, only 5 mins away from Bali collection shopping centre. beach also 5min walk away from villas, Very quiet place"
Jingxi C,"Xi'an, China",Feb 2015,"The water sport, like the prasailing, is exciting.The beautiful scenery is wholesome both to the eye and to the heart.The thrillng nightlife is new to us, including the local food and universal music.The kindness and hospitality shown to visitors by the local people."
Laxton Cat,"Cheltenham, UK",Feb 2015, If you would like to read a book and have a cool drink by the beach then it is best place for you.It is the ideal  beach for sunbathing with golden sand and clean blue sea. It is not a place for wind suffering or or water activities. There were a few hawkers around but not intrusive.
RoshiniKS,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,good for walking in the morning. You come along other hotels along the beach and get to meet people. Good thing is that you don't find unnecessary touts to bother you along the beach. I enjoyed my walks. 
LuciaPrihandini,Indonesia,Feb 2015,"Nusa Dua is my favorite beach in Bali. Quiet environment, clear water and sand although the accomodations are quite pricey but it's worth to experience"
Rubyfelixtulla,"Havelock North, New Zealand",Sep 2014,Our hotel had a separate area for the guests. Someone to hand out towels and ensure everything ok. Nice swimming beach. 
ashi_kathuria2001,New Delhi,Nov 2014,Beach is not too clean though respective hotel tries to maintain the beach in their frontage. The beach smells horrible when there is low tide.
LYNNY1947,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,Loved the beach. Staying at the melia plenty of lounges available and trees to shelter from the sun. Could not dislike anything expect humidity high in february so would have walked on the beach more
jenny c,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,Lovely beach and area. Quiet and very relaxing. The beach and water were both very clean. Lovely restsurants short taxi rides away. 
farhaanp5,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"Nusa Dua is a really good and clean beach. Its nice and quite, and has white sand and very clean water. There are lots of water activities down in the beach area. A must visit if you are in Nusa Dua."
L-Sihui,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"- 10mins walk from Bali Collection- Nice, quiet and clean- White sandy beach with crystal clear water- Watersports available but further down the beach area- Lots of beachfront hotel to choose for your stay"
Raj Saiya,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,"Its a very busy and nice beach but make sure u have a good guide or good with haggling for the Sea Walker and other activities. Try the combo packages as they will save you a bit of money, Snorkel ling was not so good though"
Cow8boy,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2015,Great beach to get some sleep or get into some water sports without the rubbish of Kuta floating around you
Robin Harly,"Los Angeles, CA",Jan 2015,"Chrystal clear water, less people and noiseless. The beach is surrounded by mostly 5 stars hotels, so most people who come to this area are the resorts' guests. To access the area you will need to go through the gated entrance-no fees."
Parveen Kathuria,"Kota, India",Oct 2014,"One of the good beaches with a row of 5 star luxury hotels so that each hotel maintains the beach as a whole.standing on the beach , you also get a good view of the bali and sea ."
Irem I,"Istanbul, Turkey",Feb 2015,The ocean was full of plastic cans and trash :( It maybe because of the wind but it wasn't pleasant at all.
Sgr2940,"Brooklyn, NY",Jan 2015,"This stretch of beach is reserved for the luxury resorts in this area. The fine white sand, warm blue water and quiet atmosphere are the ideal place to relax."
Jacqui L,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"Wow it was beautiful so clean and clear, loved it. We had access to the beach from our hotel and was there everyday swimming cooler than the swimming pools"
rkchawla,"Navi Mumbai, India",Apr 2014,"Nuthing i have disliked abt the beach, loved every bit of it.very clean very nice chilled out place."
Vivien M,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,The beach was clean and looked white but the sand is very difficult to walk in - compared with beaches in Perth WA they are average but with  beaches in many parts of the world they would be considered good. There are lots of pieces of coral that get washed up and  sit on a ledge where the waves come up. They hurt when you stand on them! There is no shade so get there early if your hotel provides lounges and sunshades.
717Diwata,"Muntinlupa, Philippines",Jan 2015,"Nusa Dua area is at the tip of  Bali island so when we went to the beach, there was this vast expanse of sand  where visitors can leisurely walk. The right side of the beach place seems to be private and allotted only to three hotel owners The Grand Bali of Nusa Dua, Mercure and Marriott ( according to the shuttle driver). The left side of the island is a public beach where tourists can lie down on the grass and use the beach for free. There is a mini park at the very tip where locals and visitors would walk around."
Heba2015,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,Beautiful Indian Ocean. Clear waters and amazing view. Can sit there all day relaxing by the sea. Can be a little rough in January. 
LLAK,"London, UK",Jan 2015,Beautiful beach and stunning location! This area is more upmarket than some other parts of Bali and there are well landscaped gardens leading to a clean and beautiful public beach.
BaliAlajmal,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2014,"Beach with Sunset is beatiful, and Chep value, for backPacker Is So Cheap with adventure Traveling. any Driver Muslim Like In Arabian soo."
chelpot,Las Pinas,Jan 2015,Perfect for a walk with your loved ones. Not for swimming though. Far from where we stayed. I suggest they put more benches or cottages people can just sit back and relax and enjoy the ocean view.
Kroybazza,"Phnom Penh, Cambodia",Jan 2015,"I visited here 20 years ago and needless to say things have changed.  Nusa Dua now seems to be the domain of the expensive hotel - way out of my league but the beach is still a great family spot. We did a day trip and hung out at Kanaka Ocean Water Sports - did a package that included snorkeling, turtle island, para-sailing and glass bottom boat.  We booked through a local guy who got us a much better deal than if we bought from one of the road side tour sellers. There is no surf - and never will be so that makes it ideal for young kids.The snorkeling is only a few hundred meters off the beach and is great!  It is not the Great Barrier Reef but it is wonderful family friendly reef with 1000's of fish. The para-sailing was very short but loads of fun - even our 8 year old went with a guide. Turtle Island - awesome.  You may be disappointed when you first get out of the boat but hang in there it was the best hour of our trip so far.  Turtles, snakes, iguana, toucan, monkeys, flying fox and you can hold and pat them all.  Plus owls and and an enormous eagle. Not an adrenalin junkies paradise but awesome."
Shane R,"Leicester, UK",Jan 2015,"The beach at Nusa Dua (The Westin Resort) was great, it was clean, they had buoys marked out and we were informed that it was safe to swim up to the buoys. The water was clear. We enjoyed it fully, the children loved it. I would definitely advise the use of sun-screen/protection as it does get very hot in this part of the world."
MEHDI T,19 contributions,Jan 2015,try to see the sunset with a cocktail in your hand and profite about the amazing placeperfect for a couple to spend romantic time and try the water oohhhhhhh amazing
AWilson321,"Fredericksburg, TX",Nov 2014,"Most of the hotels in Nusa Dua have their own stretch of beach so its not overcrowded, it wasn't the nicest beach ive ever been to, it was average.  Lots of locals trying to sell paintings, shawls etc gets very annoying.  Top tip just pretend to be asleep and they walk right past!"
travelmaster_hu,"Budapest, Hungary",Jan 2015,"This is what a luxory beach is about!The area is closed only for the 5 star propery guest, it is a beautiful green belt far from the city's noise, this is true you pay more here, but IT IS WORTH IT!The beach is long sandy and very clean, good to be there."
TeddyBuddyTL,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2014,"All in all, it is a beautiful place to visit if there is not too many people around.On sundays, this place is just a mess. I would recommend going only on weekdays."
Achmad Maulana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2014,"nice and clean beach, few gazebo provide along the coast for visitor rest area, long beach with water blow island in the corner close to pirate bay, as most of the access thru the hotel and resort only quite difficult for guest not stay in the hotel along the nusa dua beach access to go to the beach, try to enter for nusadua galleria or from corner of club med nusa dua, by the way its good spot for surfing as well."
Hemant Sarin,"Chandigarh, India",Jun 2014,"Many hotels in Nusa Dua tourism complex have direct access to the beach and most visitors tend to spend time at the beach behind their own hotels. So its virtually a private beach. Sofitel, where we stayed, has its own portion of this beautiful beach, its clean, not too deep and clear waters. The sand is grainy, not as smooth as in Jimbaran, but not uncomfortable to walk or lie down on. Massages are available as well as some sea sport activities. These are not provided by the hotels but by locals. One can walk on the beach passing all the wonderful hotel properties. There is a cycle track too. "
el0ise2015,"Kalamunda, Australia",Jan 2015,"After visited other local beaches in Bali, I found this beach to be the cleanest and were I was happy for my family to swim in the ocean."
moorandmoor,Sydney,Jan 2015,"The beach at Nusa Dua is long, clean and safe. Compared to the ones at Kuta and Seminyak, it is infinitely superior.There is little hassle from local traders and there are lots of private beaches, being part of the many beach front hotels which front it."
jay j,"Emirate of Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jan 2015,environment not to crowd and just 5 mins from the hotelstaff were so nice and everything is gooddisliked is many street seller 
Tdgoodsell,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2015,Beautiful beach and calm warm sea.not too busy.great massage by local ladies and really cheap price.experience not to be missed.
Ramble11,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2014,"As our hotel was just on the beach, we had direct access to it. The beach is neat and clean which is commendable given the number of tourists flocking this place. We loved our little walks in the afternoon and evenings. I didn‚Äôt like 2 things about this beach:First it doesn‚Äôt gets big beautiful tides as seen in other beaches of Bali. You can‚Äôt surf here (not that we wanted to). Nevertheless this beach somehow fails to give that nice and cool vibe which you get at other beaches in Bali.Secondly a lot of water sports function here, so it does gets over crowded at times. Also due to lack of proper tide and waves it is a little difficult to enjoy those costly water sports activities."
Annie S,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Feb 2014,"I always prefer Nusa Dua beach than Kuta beach. Sure it doesn't have waves to surf. But it's clean, quiet, white sand, and pretty under rated. Just beautiful. Not much people around, since most of the beach are hotel's private beaches."
David S,"Cairns, Australia",Jan 2015,"Any hotel from Sofitel to ""The Bay"" is the best beach. Dont book pass the Hyatt. Its dirty and windy. "
SteveEgg,"Durban, South Africa",Dec 2014,"Out of season, a bit too quietGood clean beach and good food.The local area around the hotel was away from any night life"
Gintaute,"Vilnius County, Lithuania",Jan 2015,"Magnificent beach in Bali. Pretty clean, covered with white brownish sand, water is light blue on a sunny day. Much better than Kuta beach. Reminds a bit Carribean beaches - white white sand and crystal clear light blue water..."
Danielle s,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"surf in the off season, there was garbage in legain but this side of island was divine- nothing to dislike here would consider staying on my next visit"
8mmSA,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2015,Great beach. Loved it!Please don't go there if you are going to make it dirty. It is one of the last remaining beautiful areas of Bali. Leave only your footprints in the sand... (Not that human footprint called pollution and litter)
ggads,Melbourne,Jan 2015,The water in Bali is warm and inviting.  Nusa Dua doesn't have the best beaches in Bali and Bali beaches as a group are not up to the wonderful beaches at places such as Broome or Surfers Paradise.
BM1346,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Dec 2014,"Once again we had a wonderful stay at the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel. We have been there many times over the last 23 years and it remains consistently good. When we weren't taking day trips away from the hotel we relaxed by the pools, strolled along the beach front, and enjoyed a variety of restaurants including the wonderful breakfasts. My son and daughter frequently used the gym and spa and also played volleyball on the beach, - I preferred to read a good book under a frangipani by the pool.Thank you to all the staff for making our Christmas so special and relaxing."
babsonite,"Park City, UT",Oct 2014,Great location and a nice way to wind down a long trip. This is by far the cleanest beach that we experienced in Bali and overall safety and security was great!
SandzDK,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jan 2015,"Free from the usual plastic detritus that covers most of Bali beaches, the beach at Nusa Dua is maintained by the various hotels and resorts dotted alongside it. Plenty of water sports available for hire from the vendors who ply the beach - jet surf, surf boards, paddle boards, paragliding etc. Also beach massage, temporary tattoos, hair braiding and the like. Close by is the ubiquitous market selling pareos, T's and Balinese curios.Beach is great to lie on and people watch from and the water just the right temperature to cool off. Toilet facilities basic. "
DaveYoung151,"Shanghai, China",Jan 2015,"Forget the Jimboran sunset or the Kuta nightlife, Nusa Dua is the top spot to relax on the beach. Its definitely worthwhile to cough up the extra cash and splurge for a hotel night or two here.  Don't bother with the polluted Kuta and Jimboran beaches.  Its the nicest, cleanest, and scenic beach in all of Bali.  Massages are decent, hotels are pumping out the down tempo trance for ambiance and the tourists vary from all over the world, not just Australians.  My only disappointment was finding this beach the last day of my trip."
Igor d,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Beautiful beach with trees for shade at places in front of the grant Hyatt (have not been elsewhere). Beach and ocean lit up at night. Several water activity hire places available. There are numerous bars in the resorts that exist along this strong of beach.
JAYNE671192,"Kingston-upon-Hull, UK",Nov 2014,The Beach looks amazing but the times we have been the currents are very strong so swimming in the sea is not advisable.  The sand near the sea has lots of pebbles rocks and stones so suitable footwear would be recommended.  These comments might be just because of the time of year we visited Bali and some beaches will be safer and better than others.
Ëéπ È≠è,3 contributions,Jan 2015,"Wow, it sounds great. Westin Hotel beach is nice to relax by dozing on hired dream bed or gazebo.  Food is ordinary. "
Kayleen P,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,We went to this after seeing it on Tripadvisor. It is accessible by getting driver/taxi driver etc to take you there the Grand Hyatt NUSA DUA and then walking about 900 meters ( might be abit more but it only takes about 10 mins of slow walking) along a good footpath to the boardwalk to the blowholes... Yes there is warnings... You need to use commonsense and be aware... The blowholes are spectacular...and I found the view overall to be breathtaking...happy to sit and just soak up the scene for awhile.... Well worth the visit...there is also a few monuments that are in the area...they too are worth a visit... One commemorates a meeting of world leaders.lmwhere they each planted a commemorative tree...and one is dedicated to Ramayana ( Indonesia's Romeo and Juliet love story) overall a enjoyable visit ... pathway and Boardwalk would be accessible to wheelchairs... and the platform for viewing the blowholes is reasonably  wide and flat on the lower levels
meowcat39,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Dec 2014,"It's sooo beautiful and warm during high-tide. As soon as the tide goes out its a seaweed-filled, smelly, muddy mess."
John A,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2014,The beach is not spectacular. The sand is coarse and the sea bottom rocky. The beach does offer a very pleasant running venue. 
UKJohn88,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2014,"Nusa Dua is in a gated compound so feel very safe there. Not crowded. Beach is clean, water is calm and clear. Great for swimming. "
dbrooks25,Tokyo,Dec 2014,"This was my second trip to Bali, but my first time to tour around the southern peninsula. While my hotel was in Semanyak, Bali, I went on a tour to several sites around Nusa Dua on Thursday, Dec. 25th. It was arranged by my hotel for us to go to Nusa Dua to see the beach, and then we drove over to Uluwatu Temple (Pura Luhur Ulawatu), on the western coast, where we stayed for the 6:00pm performance of the kecak dance.  Afterward, we stopped at Jimbaran Beach and had seafood at one of the several beachside restaurants there. See details about the temple and its kecak dance performance at:http://goseasia.about.com/od/indonesiastopattractions/a/uluwatu_kecak.htm"
Karleen L,"Dunsborough, Australia",Dec 2014,"Nice beach to swim in, just a shame that the shoreline is taken up by big 5 star resorts, so there is limited shade if you are just coming for a swim. If you find Nusa Dua Beach Grill at the south end though this is a nice place to hang out after a swim. The beach is gentle, suitable for families, although there was a slight side current when we were there. Clear water. We saw someone on a SUP board so they're probably for hire somewhere nearby."
johan c,United Kingdom,Dec 2014,"This beach is amazing so clean and beautiful and the water is so nice, the sand is great. Was amazing going from kuts beach to here, made me wish we stayed in Nusa Dua area just for the beach"
Ansettgirl,Sydney,Nov 2014,This beach is beautiful - particularly at high tide.  The water is crystal clear and the sand is clean.  The little squirrels all along the beach add to its beauty.
SunseekerFinland,Finland,Dec 2014,We spend a day here on the beach. The beach is realy beautifull and we did a great snorkeling trip by boat from the beach. I woud not want to stay in the area at least for many days because it seemed boring. The beach is lovely though.
Smoothie1412,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Nov 2014,"Blue crystal, quiet, great spot for surfing or even just lying to get tan. Use the access of the private beach of luxury hotel, super clean beach and nobody almost."
nhanse73,"Fairbanks, AK",Dec 2014,"Don't come to Bali for the beaches. You will be disappointed. Nusa Dua beach has some decent views, but nothing that will knock your socks off. "
SenseiSandra1956,"Waddington, NY",Dec 2014,"The beach was wonderful! Clear water, clean sand and not crowded-Low tide was so calm and you could see the bottom- High tide had small waves that delighted the kids playing there."
Rebecca G,"Queensland, Australia",Nov 2014,Great beach to take walks on. We hired bikes and were able to see a lot more following the walking path
Georgie M,"Newman, Western Australia, Australia",Dec 2014,"Beautiful and definitely family friendly! We loved this area, a mix of locals and tourists and lots of luxury resorts. "
Waryonetwo,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,"Ok so if you are tired of the filthy water, litter and scavenging dogs, pack up and head for Nusa Dua. Cost around $25.00 in a metered taxi for a great beach day. I'd you are a little bit cunning and confident you can also,spend time at the pools of some very swanky hotels."
sanjay b,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2014,clean.....safe......very accessible from the hotelquiet....no hawkerswaves broke out way off...so the waves that came in were very small....
GlennDias,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2014,"White sand, crescent beach, a smattering of fishing boats, palm trees, peace, quiet.We patronized the Beach Club of the Courtyard Marriott, Nusa Dua both during the day and for sundowner cocktails."
Paul_A_Pavlou,"Philadelphia, PA",Dec 2014,"Beautiful, clean sandy beach, calm waters, perfect for families and for relaxing. Highly recommended. "
Nataly1111,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Dec 2014,Great clean beach with nice blue Ocean water. It is good to swim even when waters comes up or goes down
ARUN63512,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2014,"It is a nice quiet beach, I stayed in the westin resorts which is facing the beach, had good time in relaxing on the beach."
lazuzi,"Miri, Malaysia",Dec 2014,The beach was dirty full of people being herded towards the different activities available. Not nice at all. I just wish we had not wasted out time going there. The experience was really not enjoyable at all!
Vishrutta,"Doha, Qatar",Dec 2014,We stayed at Courtyard marriott.. Not sure whether low tide was a reason for able to see so many seaweeds or what but because of so many seaweeds I personally never liked to go in the beach here
Juliette A,"Meerbusch, Germany",Dec 2014,"The Public portion of the beach is dirty, the only clean parts of the beach are the private beaches which belong to the resorts.  We were very disappointed"
Ourdogrocks,"New York City, NY",Dec 2014,"Nice white sand beach and calm water.  We were at an area that is kept up by a hotel, so it was combed and kept up nicely.  Clear blue water! Great place for a calm and relaxing day!"
Carol M,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,very clean and lovely white sand nice depth for swimming and lovely to sit and read a book on and watch the fishing boats
seventeen017,Bandung,Dec 2014,"If you don't/can't dive, this is the kind of underwater activity that will suit you. Safe, and you can also enjoy your interaction with many kind of fish that surrounds you."
Recordeiro,"Florianopolis, SC",Dec 2014,"if you are looking for a quiet and calm beach to rest, Nusa Dua is an excellent choise! You can find beautifull resorts over there and good restaurants as well."
Aditya_india,"Jaipur, India",Nov 2014,The nusa dua is extremely clean with white sands and clear water it is great for swim and sun bathing too. be careful of urchins though..Its perfect for evenings on holidays;) as there are plenty cafes and restaurants by the beach and many five star properties. Its always good to chill at the beach on a comfy couch sipping chilled malibu or exotic wines watching the sun go down..
Carolyn A,"Wickham, Australia",Dec 2014,"The beach in front of the Laguna is kept free from rubbish. The water is clean, clear and the perfect temperature. I did notice a poster advising to be careful of dangerous sea urchins in the area but did not see one the whole week. Perhaps they are further out on the reef."
Terri D,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Dec 2014,"Well, if you are going for a beach holiday, this will fit the bill. Be careful in the water as there are some big rips, but stay safe between the flags and you should be okay. Lovely clean beach to stroll along. Shade, drinks, food, all available- plus all sorts of stuff from the hawkers if you wish (i.e. sarongs, dresses, massage, kites....etc) but they happily move on as soon as you indicate disinterest. No problem."
Rohan S,"Christchurch, Canterbury, New Zealand",Nov 2014,"The beach is a bit crap compared to those in the north.  Lots of seaweed etc, but lots of great fooderies and no hawkers to be seen"
VincentChia,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"The sea sports only for experience, and relatively pricy.If wanna experience, the para-sailing and underwater walk is a must try ... for family with kids, banana boat is available ...the rest, no point trying"
Hoomoilanen,"Tampere, Finland",Dec 2014,"From the moment you arrive there, the process will take care of you. Considering the amount of fellow objects, they succeed amazingly well. Was lured into this hell to do a bit of snorkling. That bought me 2 slices of toast and a 3-minute boat trip to one of the dozens of floating platform from which thousands of tourists (most of whom obviously unable to swim) went all-in with their white bread. For anyone who's even snorkel before, would strongly suggest avoiding this nightmare. There may be a trashless beach somewhere in Bali where one can snorkel, I just failed to find it. The trip to Gili T. more than made it up for me."
Desita89,"Prague, Czech Republic",Mar 2014,"We spent here 3 hours with our driver. There are 2 beaches. Beaches is very nice with clean and clear water. On the beach were just a few people, it was great. No entrance fee."
JackieChinNotChan,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2014,"Unlike the other beach crowded with hundreds of boats for water sports and transport to turtle island, this one near Hotel Santika is pretty quiet and relaxing. Water isn't the clearest I've seen, but clean enough to be called decent with calm, low waves. The sand isn't exactly the finest, but quite clean and free from edgy rocks. Marine lives aren't apparent there except some kelp and coral may occasionally be spotted with some tiny crabs at certain stretch.With some trees for shades, this stretch is not planted with stereotypical palms and pines which often cause the sand to be blended with spiky acorns or twigs, the sand is rather safe and comfy to walk on. Shaded benches may be rented (overpriced compared to many other beaches of different countries) and bars are available, too."
ohclaramia,"Bunbury, Australia",Nov 2014,What I disliked was having to leave.view was amazing overlooking pool and beach couldn't ask for more.
Shachi V,"Lucknow, India",Nov 2014,"In bali this is the beach if one is looking all kinds of water sports. The water is clean, sand is good. Lots of water sports are available like diving, parasailing,donut boat, banana boat, jet ski etc. More activities more cost effective."
Nicole S,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,"THis one is for all the Australian traveller, make sure you stop and meet Maria/Nyomin and the gang at this AWESOME little traditional Bali Cafe, Dont worry about the bali belly here, Home made Chips are the best, Very cheap and top quality food, prepared by Indonesians that know how to prepare western food.PLease support our friends, they have an awesome cook and you can get a ice cold mug for your beer - How good is that. Rice and Noodle dishes, start at a crazy $2-3 !! You need to check this place out - NOT Fancy but DELICIOUS!!!! Warung Maria on the Food Strip at Nusa Dua Beach!! (next to melia)"
EX_Travel8gent,AUSTRALIA,Dec 2014,"Its cleaned in the mornings.. , has grainy sand, waves are not big, great to sit on sun beds and be served if you need for drinks etc.. There is a nice esplanade to walk along "
HelenForever,"Tuban, Indonesia",Nov 2014,I love nusa dua beach much better in terms of cleanliness than kuta area. And its more private too....
Alireza S,9 contributions,Jul 2014,The Nusa Dua beach is clean with nice sand. Wave action is not strong to disturb but crystal clear water attract you for a wonderful snorkeling close to small patchy boulders. There are places for jet ski and diving too. I enjoyed stay in the area which was warm enough for sun bating and a relax reading under umbrella. Enjoy your stay at Nusa Dua Beach.
Darrin D,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2014,LOved the Nusa Dua Beach - clean and lovely views with gentle breezes - perfect to sip a beer or enjoy a cocktail on the sand
Darthduh,35 contributions,Nov 2014,"Relatively clean sand, and not as crowded as some of the others, this beach is just a place to bum and chill out."
Staessen,"Ichtegem, Belgium",Aug 2014,"great beach, quiet, wild water to look at, great so watch the surfers do their thing, also nice to take a walk with your partner"
dg3225,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2014,The beaches are dirty in this area.  It seems like a sewer or dumping operation is taking place off shore and it just washes back up.  The water was murky and I did not go in.  There is huge amounts of smelly seaweed that is not raked up.  Just not pleasant.  The Seminyak beaches were just the opposite.
AndyT,"Liverpool, UK",Nov 2014,This is a cove so has a tide and during the day it seemed to be out.  Water is lovely and safe to swim
drsagar_c,"Hyderabad, India",Nov 2014,"The beach is clean with white sand, can bicycle around along beach line to reach the point where huge waves hit the beach. Plenty of hawkers selling stuff like sarong, beachware and shells. Bargain hard...The watersports center is located here and good, Prices again can be bargained a little. Very hot and humid in Nov and dec"
Nino J D,"Ormoc, Philippines",Nov 2014,We were on a road trip on that day. We decided to head to the beach and explore the tip of the peninsula where it is called Nusa Dua. We were greeted by a few statues of hindi gods then a trail that led us to a garden with large letters - NUSA DUA FIESTA and behind are vast statues of two warriors in lime green large figures mounted on a high platform. a few meters behind is the tip of the peninsula which is composed of dead corals where the waves smash and water blows (as consequence). It has a public beach where surfing is also allowed but the waves are smaller
Pauline C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"The waves on beach were too strong early in the morning  and beach too hot after that. However the stay at the Ayodya Resort Palace rooms was excellent with their congenial staff, restaurants and spa.. "
Kaz B,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"clean, seats available at beach resort was quiet facilities were available jet skies etc massages available table umbrella for shade was great "
Neelam B,"Birmingham, UK",Oct 2014,We satyed at the laguna resort in nusa dua and ofcourse  we had access to the beach. The water was so calm and clean.  White sands.. Turquoise waters ...it was amazing! Theres a pier to stroll to and also a little peak where you can discover a hidden temple and cliffs. One of the best beaches in bali! 
Justin T,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,"Stretch of beach is long and when the tide is lower, you can actually walk quite far. Water is clear and you can see the sand bed but sadly no fishes. Sand is nice and my girls had a great time building sand castles."
MamaAndBabyTraveling,"Hamburg, Germany",Oct 2014,"If you want to spend days with non stop Sun, white sandy beach and quiet place, please stay in Nusa Dua. So many beautiful places for you to stay, with their own private beach and security is maximum and also save for family and kids. Not too crowded with local Balinese on a holiday.My suggestion is for you to stay at St Regis Hotel, you will not regret any of this experience. Next to St Regis is also The Bale if its more suitable to your expenses. And many more up such as Grand Hyatt Nusa Dua, Kayu Manis Nusa Dua, Sofitel, Grand Nikko and Royal Santrian."
sig45ace,"Houston, TX",Mar 2014,"We went to Nusa Dua beach just for a bit of an outing, but ended up riding elephants through the jungle and over to another beach and back! It was the highlight of one of our children's week - she loves elephants! They were extremely well cared for and it was a lot of fun!"
Alex V,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Nov 2014,"Nice quite beach, Not as busy as legian but I do prefer legian over Nusa dua beach, a lot cheaper to"
SunSeekingSan2,"Kelowna, Canada",Oct 2014,"The beach is long and wide, great for walking. White soft sand.  The waves break out aways by a reef so they are quiet. The area from the beach to the reef is shallow to walk out on. The end of the point is park with running/walking track.  The very point is volcanic rock with a blow hole which is fun to watch. "
RJ2610,"Winterthur, Switzerland",Oct 2014,"Nice Beach but too many plants inside, not really good to swim... But is awesome to walk by the beach."
Leeanne W,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"The beach was only for sofitel guests it was lovely and clean ,plenty of banana lounges and umbrellas. Way to swim for most of the day until the tide went out. Not a lot of hassle from hawkers. Great place to relax"
paulynyyy,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2014,"We were staying at Courtyard Marriott and the private beach shared with other mega-hotels was about 5 minutes away from Marriott by their complimentary shuttle van. At the beach, lounger beds with towels as well as shower area were made available for the hotel guests. The bar is open at 10 am. Though, it seems like a private beach, there were water sports operators as well as sellers walking around to ask if we wanted any services from them as well as exorbitant souvenirs, hence the oxymoron title of my review. The beach is cleaned separately by the hotel staffs, however, there were lots of seaweeds with the waves bringing on to the beach. However, my kids did enjoyed their time on the beach making sandcastles but not so much on the cold waters of the sea."
Deborah S,"Heathfield, South Australia, Australia",Oct 2014,"The beach looks really nice, however the sand is really boggy, on a slop and impossible to walk any distance on. A little disappointing"
Robert B,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,"Quiet and clean. No hassle at all. Easy to get around, the beach could be a bit deeper for a swim, but all in all it was very good."
Adrian P,"Banbridge, UK",Oct 2014,The beaches are St Regis and The Laguna are really well maintained with plenty of privacy. The sea is fantastic once the tide is in 
Lizmarieevangelista,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"it was low tide when we went and the water was not very clean, seaweeds everywhere and a bit of trash here and there."
Andien,113 contributions,May 2014,Excellent beach behind Sofitel hotel..I ran there in the morning and love the quiet morning and sea breeze..
lynette g,Perth,Oct 2014,"I didn't like the squirrels eating food at the tables at breakfast,but loved the variety at breakfastSwimming in the ocean was lovely and clean not like other parts of Bali"
mandsc2015,87 contributions,Nov 2013,"Maybe we missed the perfect weather, but when we were there, it did not look like the above picture, rather green water and a bit dirty and cloudy.Hotels were divine, restaurants and fun factor pretty good. Surf apparently can be good too, depending on season.Beaches in front of hotel nice and raked, but not ""maldives"".Dont expect perfect blue clear seas, you will be disappointed. But still amazing experience and lovely locals - also some really good package deals include things like massages, so look out for those."
Silviamascarello,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,"The beach is nice with soft sand, but the sea is not that great (high tide in the morning for few hours)"
BABUDHAKA,Dhaka,Sep 2014,"U can ask for your requirement and U can enjoy hard drinks also.if u have previous booking , it is good for your group."
Delyth S,"Cardiff, UK",Oct 2014,"Beautiful clean beach, with water so clear and warm. Mostly occupied by the large resort hotels, but quiet areas still available"
Katerina,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"The beach is dirty due to the tide coming and going, there are tiny corals in the sand that will make you wish you had shoes on and the water is only knee high at best. The pictures look stunning but it really is not that great. There is seaweed all over the seabed, which I find disgusting. The resorts on the beach create a nice atmosphere with the lanterns and fairy lights in the evening but the beach itself is nothing but disappointing. I would not spent my $$$ to stay there. What a shame."
HungryFriend,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"there's a secret path to one of the unique sites of nusa dua beach... there, if you are lucky or on the right time when the tidal wave is high enough, you'll see water climb up to 3 metres above your head, just as the name, the water blow up high... between the rocks..."
Robert B,"Mittagong, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach was quiet and well maintained. Not much water when the tide is out.Good for a look and a walk along the paths looking at other hotels and resorts.
QueenofCarlisle,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2014,I am not a strong swimmer and therefore was very cautious when I waded into the Indian Ocean. I could see how easily even experienced swimmers could get into trouble very quickly. Not worth the risk. The area has a reputation for claiming the lives of unsuspecting tourist. If you have children...much better to stay poolside if you're staying at a hotel.
Adam v,51 contributions,Dec 2013,"One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen. The planet has so many nice beaches to offer but one of those beaches is placed there. We enjoyed our relaxed our holiday staying at ""Nusa Dua beach resort"" which I would also highly recommend."
Vania,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Nov 2013,Best beach to visit in Bali. The warm and clean water made us stay for longer. Nusa Dua is not crowded at least not  in november-december time. For those with kids I consider a must go and stay because Bali can be very crowded and annoying in certain times. Nice visit.
Kelvin87,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2014,"we stay in club med , Very clean beaches, you can see fish swimming , the sea is not deep as u can walk far away into it. awesome sea activities available with some cost."
Rosalia D,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,"Nice to relax and enjoy if you are there for a holiday. It's quiet serene and very private. It's so different from Kuta Beach as its clean and you will not be asked for a pedicure etc etc.,Great for families to come for Xmas and New Year"
Devashish P,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,Plenty of water sports activities with many pricing options. Please bargain before agreeing to any cost.like i was asked to pay 70 $ per person for Sea walk i end up bargaing 70 $ for 2 persons. So you can imagine 50 % cost is extra added and if you can bargain please do.Though water is not very clear but we enjoyed a lot.
JillbeeH,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2014,"We stayed at Melia Bali, right on Nusa Dua beach.We had been using the pool at the resort but decided to take a dip in the ocean.It was like stepping into a lukewarm bath!!  But the water was clear and the beach very clean.Extremely safe for little children."
Usman M,"London, UK",Aug 2014,"Its like going from one world to another; once you enter the Nusa Dua beach its like a different world.The whole area is clean love the statues and it felt safe.If you going to Bali; this is one of the best places to get a hotel.  The whole area has nice clean, the beach is awesome and you felt like it was another part of Bali.  The people are running, relaxing and enjoying.  It felt so nice and safe.One of nicest beach resorts in the world I would say."
Wags70,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Spent the day at the beach and it was wonderful but remember to slip slop slap because even the wind will burn you and you don't even relies it's happening and we were in the shade of an umberella, the water was warm and just a relaxing place."
kevin_ward63,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,Took the kids to Bali and went to visit the 'Water Blow' at Nusa Dua Beach. So disappointed everything was closed up and the walkway was dismantled and left to reuin. The beach was beautiful though.
IrinaBanicaBucharest,"Bucharest, Romania",Sep 2014,"Large beach with great sand, blue waters, water sports to die for. We loved it. We especially like the trying the jet sky. If you go more into the heart of Nusa Dua there are some restaurants and bars on the beach side."
Adrian H,"Northwest Romania, Romania",Nov 2013,"This is a very beautiful beach with white and nice sand, clean beach and good water. Good place to stay at sun or under trees ..."
BELMONT Ipswich,"Ipswich, UK",Oct 2014,"The beach is very safe, clean, & fine sand. It is very shallow to swim in, at low tide it is impossible to swim in as it is so shallow. Boats go from the beach to the reef for snorkling."
Anand S,"Bengaluru, India",Sep 2014,Well maintained with amazing resorts next to the beach. This place gives you an amazing sunrise view. The evenings will be really nice for a walk.
SamarGhaly,"Cairo, Egypt",Jan 2014,"the beach was amazing and the water was pure, we had a great time there, there was also many water activities."
Meredith L,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2014,Beautiful beach white sand. Great for families good for water sports. we had our own beach club through novotel awesome to get relax and swim...
Cart70,2 contributions,Sep 2014,"My husband was on the viewing platform at the water blow in Nusa Dua on 27th September, one week after Leisa M below stated 'no element of danger at all'. A huge freak wave hit the viewing platform causing part of the handrailing he was holding to collapse. This resulted in him, along with several others, being swept onto the rocks. Luckily they were pulled to safety by other tourists who were standing well back. My husband required 3 hours of surgery to repair the damage and an overnight stay at BIMC hospital, who by the way were exceptional. Three other tourists also on the path required surgery and several others suffered cuts and bruises. Please do NOT consider this area as safe. "
Mark A,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"Nusa Dua beaches have blue water but at low tide are only knee deep. Having said that, if you pick the tides you will have several hours in head high water."
dennisb-0452,"Leigh-on Sea, UK",Sep 2014,Not enough umbrellas unless  you got there early. Deceptively strong undercurrent. Quite big waves. Lack of lifeguards
Stbroker,"Kuching, Malaysia",Sep 2014,What can i say bout what meets the eye in nusa dua....just heavenly and to see it is to believe....do not miss the chance to see and feel why Bali is so popular...
Merc9SLK,"Scarborough, yorkshire",Sep 2014,"We stayed at The Laguna Beach Resort which is on Nusa Dua Beach and were very pleased to discover the bay to be large with white clean sand and shallow crystal clear water.  The bay is protected by a natural reef and is tidal.  Early morning and late at night sees the tide withdraw uncovering tiny rock pools and where you can witness local fishermen walking on the seabed with head torches looking for shellfish etc.If you stand still in the water you can easily spot small shoals of stripey fish - some the size of your hand.  The water is extremely warm - enough to make you sit in the shallow areas without gasping as you would normally hold your breath from coolness upon entering!We were not bothered by anyone on the beach in attempts to sell anything to us, although we never ""laid"" on the beach loungers and only laid by the pool.  However, there is a purpose built footpath fringing the beach you can walk for some distance past all the hotels which leads to the Bali Collection (a shopping centre with restaurants)- part of this walk at night is lined with white lanterns swaying in the breeze which is very romantic.  Beyond the Bali Melia Hotel the beach becomes more public and the sand not as clean, littered with some seaweed and disgarded packaging - however, this appeared to be where the locals would sit in the tree shade and watch over their ""little ones"" playing in the shallow waters."
AmandaCfromMelb,3 contributions,Sep 2014,"It was quite and a protected beach. There are beach sellers, trying to see you everything from day trips, to sarongs and kids kites. They are very respectful and usually only ask you once or twice if you are lying on the beach or sun lounges. While you may pay a little more, we were ok as this is their livelihood and they don't earn much. I witnessed another Australian woman haggling and being rude in her interaction, which was unnecessary and embarrassing. Always be polite. The Balinese are lovely people. "
Ashish Maini,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2014,One of the best beaches you can go..be it night or day nusa dua beach gives you calm..water is good and clean..best part when u sitting on a private beach there is no dearth of beer around you.
H R,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2013,"Have a relax walk at the long beach, have to pay for the chairs & umberella if u want, the sand is smooth but a bit big wave sometimes."
Therese G,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Sep 2014,"Beautiful sandy beach, goes on forever. Views amazing. Take a good book! Great place to chill out and relax."
Bhima Subrahmanyam,Navi Mumbai,Sep 2014,"Nusa Dua Beach is excellently connected belt from Melia Bali to Lagoon to Westin to Nusa Dua resort.Walking around the Bay area is very pleasant.It was heartening to watch a number of programmes are organised through out the belt/strip.One loves to watch wedding ceremonies,wedding receptions,spl programmes for honeymoon couple etc.An excellent area one should not miss to visit when you are around Bali."
Shahtaj N,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Aug 2014,"beautiful beach, fresh air, clean water and most importantly less crowded! its totally different from kuta beaches..the sound of the wave, the bench under the trees, big beautiful kites flying in the sky makes it more majestic! if you are going for honeymoon or without kid, its the best place to spend more time. just loved it!"
mick035,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"For all you big kids at heart who want a full day of adventure on the water, this is the place for you. My wife and I did the jet ski's, donut and the sea walker which was just amazing for an underwater adventure. Will definitely do this again."
mlelsc,Ireland,Dec 2013,"The beach at the Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua is superb, extremely well kept and pristine clean. Swimming is safe but beware if surfers are surfing and do not swim out too far in case of encountering one!"
Harvey327,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,"Great white sandy beaches, no hassling by hawkers and easy access to hotel. Easy to walk along the beach to other hotels bars and restaurants."
Hottoddie60,"Perth and Kinross, UK",Aug 2014,"Loved the food, great cocktails, lazing about by the pool or beach, beautiful people, sunsets and scenery. Plenty to see and do. "
Paul S,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Aug 2014,"A wide range of activities from swimming, massages, walking and water sports. Nothing to dislike. Hire a lounge on the beach and chill out."
Adel_Fouad,Egypt,Aug 2014,"i like the duck restaurant there ,i tried smoked crispy duck and fresh watermelon juice, it was amazing "
Vivek D,"Jodhpur, India",Sep 2014,its an amazing beach to be at and chill out... with frndz and family... wow u can just sit and relax
Leon S,"Keswick, Canada",Mar 2014,"Nice, quiet beach in a low traffic area of the island.  Probably not as nice as Kuta but waaaayyy less crowded"
haydengo,5 contributions,Sep 2014,"We did not come to Bali for the beaches, they just don't compare to many of the other beaches around the world that have so much more to offer. We stayed at the St Regis on the far end of Nusa Dua, so we only saw this beach from Geger Temple to the Hyatt. Where we were was very quiet, very relaxing and there was a nice breeze. No annoying vendors, no loud music, minimal people. On the other hand, this beach is not well suited for swimming as it is very shallow and experiences pronounced tidal changes, and there is a bunch of nasty sea grass growing all over the place and some trash and seaweed on the shore. It's not pretty. In some areas it's also difficult to walk along the shore because the sand is sloped and deep."
Robert k,Germany,Sep 2014,"Only area where the hotels have stretches of swimmable beaches. Nusa Dua Beach which is very good and superbly relaxing, They were very polite and friendly."
Ellemay üçπüê†üê≥,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"We were staying at the Amarterra Villas just up the road & our private beach area was located on the stretch of sand amongst all the 5 star hotels. There is a path that leads from one end of Nus Dua to another. St Regis, Sheraton, Westin, Grand Hyatt plus endless others are all connected along this path which makes it a very interesting stroll especially early evenings & late afternoons when the locals all come out to fish & swim. The beach is gorgeous although no waves due to the reef it was still beautiful & clean with golden sand. There is a public beach area with car-parking, umbrella & deck chair hire at Pantai Mengiat. The caf√©  Warung Yasa Segara runs numerous reef snorkelling tours from the caf√©. If visiting the area its a must do to try the wonderful food at Warung Yasa Segara caf√© as its extremely cheap & fresh. It was one of the best meals we had in Bali. Just next door to the Warung Yasa  Caf√© there is a community run massage shop which is locally run where you can pick up a cheap massage, manicure or pedicure. You can identify the ladies by their pink t-shirts."
Leisa M,7 contributions,Aug 2014,"Despite negative reviews below (dianapop86) of the blowhole, it is safe and a gr8 attraction for the Nusa Dua beach area. There is a path provided and handrails so there is no danger if you stay on the path. Common sense would tell you this. Of course there will be danger if you are on the rocks when the wave comes in!!! Totally recommended with no element of danger at all "
dianapop86,"Timisoara, Romania",Sep 2014,"In a so overprotected and 5 stars hotel area there is this attraction - Water Blow in Nusa Dua - which is a beautiful, but very dangerous area for which there are not enough and well seen warning signs.There is small bridge built especially for sightseeing, it has some bars to hold on, on its lateral sides, but there is a 2 meters long area at the end of it without bars are anything to hold on. If you are there and a big wave comes, you can easily fall down on the rock reefs.Today, me and my husband fell down on the rocks and we were lucky to get out of it only with scratches. I was lucky to not broke my noise or else. It was a very shocking experience for us, going out of water bleeding and so on... Yes, the Water Blow in Nusa Dua is a wonderful attraction, but it is not safe enough and the authorities or the ones responsible of it should increase the safety measures with more efficient warning signs and also an efficient protection bridge if they built a bridge for sightseeing.I am writing this feedback as a warning for others to not get hurt like us and for the autorities to take measures.Thank you!"
slao,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2014,"Visited a month ago and during mornings its high tide with small surf and some sea weeds, at around 3pm onwards, its low tide and one can walk out to more than 200 meters...very quiet beach, well maintained. Stayed along the Ayodya beachfront which is mopre secluded tha Hyatt's and right in the middle of a very long cove...Beachfront is more than 10 kilometers long where one can hav a leisurely walk or jog. A very nice sunset view. So nice, I stayed 3 days along the beachfront area without leaving. (even having lunch on beachfront.)"
Dr Haider B,"Manama, Bahrain",Sep 2014,"Good for swimming little wave in the morning then low tide ,and lot of secretly .close to bar,I didn't see water sport "
Michael P,"Glynde, Australia",Sep 2014,"The Beach at Nusa Dua is clear and beautiful.  Resorts are dotted along the beach, along with some local cheap massage places and shops.  The waters are calm in the protected bay and there are lots of fish to be seen swimming around."
Cruise H,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"The above two were the worst, but it was to go to the beach and then go swim in the hotel pools, and then spend $70 for lunch with soft drinks at $7 each....."
Rony0011,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Aug 2014,Wonderful area for every travelers. Nothing to dislike. For family with young children this is the perfect place to stay.
Somya S,"Noida, India",Aug 2014,"very calm, shallow beach with clear water, perfect for swimming and a great escape with kids as its v shallow. also the beach is very well maintained, nobody bugs you, fewer people on the beach. Recommend to go to beach from Grand Hyatt resort side (if you don't want to do water sports), there is public area there, very beauiful beach setting with restaurants overlooking the beach."
michML,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,"located in stretch of highly protected luxury hotel area. Touters around but very safe. Clear waters, but beach i will not say is very very clean and soft sand. but it's good enough for a great relaxed beach holiday."
Kimberly J J,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,Every thing about this hotel was great AAA rating will stay again in the near future Palace Club  is worth staying in.
Abhi0911,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,"Beautiful shallow beach, clean crystal clear water. Well maintained. We spent like a whole day in here. Not too many visitors hence you have some privacy as well."
Kasia_Slig,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Aug 2014,"For those who would like to escape from tourists - Nusa Dua beach is perfect. Water cleanliness depends on the level, in the evenings there is outflow and water becomes much more clear. For those who would like to dive, snorkel or go to turtle island - it's perfect choice."
Kel P,Aus,Sep 2014,"Easy to swim, no rubbish anywhere, no one hassling you to buy anything. Perfect for families. This beach is very calm"
les f,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2014,"We stayed in a hotel with a private area of the beach, which was quite good, however out side the private areas are not so well looked after,  we walked in the mornings as their is a walking path most of the way along the front,  which is fabulous,  and there is no one trying to sell you something. Good beach but you can't beat the Qld coast beaches- sorry."
pradeep k,17 contributions,Jul 2014,"This is a very good beach, especially for water sports...This beach has lot of water sports options...one can choose a provider based on budget and beach maintenance."
JARH08,London,Aug 2014,"This is an amazing sandy beach.  The waters are crystal clear, the sands are clean and well maintained with seaweed being swept away daily. The majority of this stretch of beach belongs to the 4/5 star hotels located on the beachfront.The beaches can get crowded in the day in peak seasons.  There is a public walkway running the length of the beach which is lovely to walk along before the sunsets.Shallow waters so ideal for those with children.Probably one of the best beaches in Bali!"
MarkTWN,"Taipei, Taiwan",Aug 2014,very laid back and lots of nice resorts.  food selections aren't too many but you can just eat at your hotel and enjoy the beach
Rizky M,3 contributions,Aug 2014,"Clean beach and not too crowded. i havent found a thing that i did not like about this beach, maybe the limited acces to the beach because the location are in limited complex"
AdelaideTraveller888,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2013,"Our resort had direct access to Nusa Dua beach, so we enjoyed many long walks along the beach. Get up very early for the sunrises, something very special and they are free!  There are no hawkers allowed on the beach, so you really can lay down on a towel and relax for the day. There are some stalls along the boardwalk, as well as places to have a beachside massage or to drop your laundry off to be washed. The sellers are not pushy and are much more respectful of tourists than other parts of Bali. Our resort package included watersports, so we enjoyed the sea-walk, banana boat rides, jet skiing, all close to the resort. We also rode bikes along the boardwalk. Very peaceful and relaxing."
Jade1903,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2014,"Great beach, lovely cool breeze to keep you comfortable, and really nice loungers to lay back and relax on.  Also lovely ocean walk to a really impressive park and Bali Connection where the shops are located and also free shuttles to hotels."
Nick,"Guildford, United Kingdom",Aug 2014,Nusa Dua beach is an absolute paradise.. Lots of water sports available and also nice and quiet if you want it to be! Great sand and water!
Renee M,"Covington, LA",Aug 2014,"What I liked about Nusa Dua is that the beaches there are more private and are not packed with people and hawkers.  We spent the entire day there and really enjoyed it.  There was some trash on the beach, but that's pretty common for Bali.  Overall, it's a really good place to just lay on the beach and relax."
GregFlies,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,You can stroll along the beaches as they are all private resort beaches without people trying to sell you stuff.
HappyTraveller4350,"Toowoomba, Australia",Aug 2014,A long beach with many many hotels ...soft sand lets you have a great workout while walking if you decide not to the the lovely path past all the hotels.  Only 2 tides each day...so low tide leaves the beach without any water....but you can walk out onto the rocks and find a tropical fish or two swimming in the pools.
Julius C,"Lausanne, Switzerland",May 2014,If You leave hotel area beaches are dirty and wild. If You stay in resort You will notice that most of people use swimming pool instead of swimming in the sea.
generalhubub,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Nice sandy beach, water clear but plenty of seaweed once you are 10-20 metres out. Novotel's area has lots of sun beds and dinner in the evening was great with a four piece band who inter-acted well with guests "
PUNIT22,"Jaipur, India",Aug 2014,"Clean and calm, not crowded at all. Some adventure activities as well. There are few activities like snorkeling, surfing, sea walking conducted in day time. There also is a big statue of Shiva at beach."
Kaveri H,"Guwahati, India",Aug 2014,"We were taken to Nusa Dua by our travel agent Pacto travels for water sports. But as we were late in the afternoon,  we decided to go for sea walking only. For a person who didn't know swimming and had never stepped into a pool earlier, the idea was very scary.  However,  seeing the confidence of the agent and diver, I agreed to go ahead. I did panic while going down but our diver Andrew was always there who guided me from going down the ladder and holding on to the railing before settling down for the 20 minute walk. The experience I got, I shall never forget. It was awesome. And specially made comfortable by the diver and his team. I thoroughly enjoyed it. My best Bali moment..."
Janine H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"We stayed in Seminyak, but did a day trip to Nusa Dua to see what the fuss is all about.  I expected to see a better and clearer beach.  It was nicer, but wouldn't go overboard about it.  If you want nice beaches, go to Thailand or Fiji.  Very big hotel resorts and would be lovely to stay for some absolutely R & R.  However, you'd have to eat at the hotels and that would raise the bill enormously."
Muzie,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2014,"There are a lot of hard particles on the beach which we reckon are dead broken corals. Therefore, please do not be bare footed to prevent from getting cut."
Ninja_Cats,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,"The beach here is very lovely, clean and i found you're less likely to get harassed compared to dare i say it, Kuta beach.I found that if you go to a hotel with the beach front you have more privacy as well as less people wondering about. Which was great as well as the beach is very close to hotels. Like you can wake up leave your hotel room and walk out into the ocean in about 100 feet which for me was awesome."
Susan K,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Jet Skis, Parasailing, Flying Fish, Banana Boat....all fantastic fun, had many many great laughs. Staff were great!!"
200KEAM,"Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2014,Biggest rip off at Nusa Dua was a so called charter boat to feed fish and see the reef through a glass bottom boat and then visit Turtle Island.  Don't do it - it cost over $120US and it is a big con.  Turtle Island is not as advertised. It is a small farm (not on an island) with some turtles and other animals - where they try and fleece you for more $.  IT IS NOT A CONSERVATION CENTRE.
Deb C,"Port Kennedy, Australia",Aug 2014,"Loved the settings for a meal, delicious and romantic, we watched the waves crash into the shore while listening to the music and waves"
aurora905,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2014,"We went there in month of march so it was very hot. Walking on beach was also tough as sand had heated up so much. Water activities are average with lack of safety and clean and equipments , specially for sea walk."
Ellie H,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2014,The beach at Nusa Dua that the Marriott hotel uses is beautiful and clean. Nice sun loungers and table service for food and drinks. The only downside is you can't swim as it is so rocky and very painful for the long walk to get out to deep enough water to swim. The beach is sandy just rocky in the sea.
regulartraveller01,"Aylesbury, UK",Sep 2013,"Nusa Dua is a beautiful beach - long wide stretch of golden sand. The water is crystal clear near the beach and gradients to pale turquoise then blue as it goes out deep.  Calm waters ideal for families - the water is shallow for quite a way so not ideal if you are an avid swimmer. The beach was spotless. I didn't see any jellyfish in two weeks but apparently like any other exotic waters, there may be some about. It is so relaxing to just sit and admire the stunning view."
Trish C,"Ocean Shores, Australia",Jun 2014,Beach itself is good and the service great just weather wise unpredictable as the kids were hoping to snorkel
Tom L L,"London, UK",Aug 2014,"Once you get over the gritty shoreline, the sand is soft underfoot. The currents are very gentle and the water shallow so ideal for swimming."
neilsa,"Spring Park, MN",Aug 2014,"Much of the time tide is low, so can not swin. No waves as they break well off shore at the reef. Maybe people don't swim here because the jellyfish signs scare them?? Sand is not White.. not sure why everyone;'s review says this bui there is nowhere on Bali with White sand it is grainy yellow. If you want White go to Philippines :)"
Tessa B,"Thalang District, Thailand",Aug 2014,It is nice. I wouldn't travel an hour or two to see it but if you are staying in Nusa dua definitely worth checking it out :)
Luana B,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,Calm and shadow waters. Nice for kids and relaxing time. I wouldn't recommend it if are planning to swim - too shadow for it. Nusa Dua is also a beautiful place. There are no sunset in this part of the island.
Len D,"Miranda, Australia",Jun 2014,"Nusa Dua is a must GO, it is clean , safe very protected so you will not be blown up as they really look after you while you are staying there as safety is a priority for them.The grounds are spotless, and it is beautiful of a night with all the lighting and it's so nice to walk along the beach front on a safe and secure pathway is a must as so many of Balis paths are unsafe.NusaDua is a lovely Bali experience."
1138WVerhoeven,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2013,"visit this place for so many time, can't say much, only one thing,, from the first time till now, I still love this place!"
Bishy,"Eastleigh, UK",Aug 2014,Pretty looking but a big undertow whilst in the water. Rats at the eastern end of the beach big enough to bbq. Rock pools inaccessible to youngsters.
shmapa,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2014,Great for windsurfing off club med . Interesting and photogenic. I loved siting on the beach with a glass of wine and just gazing at the sea.
ria080,"Noida, India",Jul 2014,"One of the most attractive beach in Bali, crystal clear blue water and white sands makes you never leave this place.A must visit if you are a beach lover. Perfect for swimming as well.There is this adjacent restaurant (forgot the name) where they serve amazing sea food. You can enjoy the ocean view as you gulp some great tasting fish from your plate."
Sue W,"Woollahra, Australia",Jul 2014,Clean water. Security patrol so you didn't get hassled.One end has all the water activities so wouldn't like to be in a hotel nearby
Angellen_10,"Mandurah, Australia",Jul 2014,"Although the beach was great to visit it was not good for swimming, while we were there in July 2014, too much rubbish in the ocean."
LarsVaaland,"Stabekk, Norway",Jul 2014,Very shallow beach with a reef outside and a lot of seagrass in between. Not really good for swimming.
SabriMarc,"Calgary, Canada",Jul 2014,Beautiful long beach with a nice Beach walk overlooking all the gorgeous resorts on one side and the Ocean on the other. Do not stop to talk to the hawkers. They are quite annoying.
adelaidegrega,"Richmond, Australia",Aug 2013,Great beach great views great paths along the  resorts great sand the water and rubbish in it was a picture from HELL.  Got back to oz and the people here could not believe photos.
Carolina M,12 contributions,Jul 2014,"I don't surf so I was really looking for a nice and sandy beach in the area (not so many) and this is definitely the paradise beach. Nice and clear water, sandy (no rocks) and it has trees for those who don't like sun. It can get a little windy some days, but even so it's the best beach in Bali."
lisamm83,"Manila, Philippines",Jul 2014,Beautiful strip of beach with a long walking track that goes right along the beach in front of all the resorts. Great for walking or cycling. A few look out points. Lovely white sand and good swimming spots for small children.
Marie R,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"The water was polluted with plastic bags. We stayed at our  Hotel's Beach club which was very enjoyable, but the beach pollution caused by Bali general rubbish, did not encourage us to swim a great deal at the beach."
riy2000,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2013,so nice and clean beach with some activates for everybody.. it's nice to walk around with many hotels beside it.
Ang S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2014,"White sands, beautiful water.  We liked lazing on the sunbeds.  Take the sun cream as the sunburn is hotttt.. Watch out for the windburn too."
SpiceandNectar,Australia,Jul 2014,Pity about the constant jet skis and motor boats ruining the tranquility and beauty of this environment. A lovely reef ruined by man made entertainment. A lot more revenue could be raised from respecting and caring for the reef with snorkling and nature based activities.
DalikaB,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2014,"Clean beach, the water is lovely and not many waves so you can swim. The only annoying part is the people with their jet skis and motor boats, it can get a bit loud and smelly with the fumes sometimes."
rudy_setiawan,"Batam Center, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"Visited this beach due to the location near to the place we stay. There are quite a number of hotels in the vicinity of the beach, many water sports activities here (jet ski, parasiling, canoing, etc). Just a short visit is fine."
Ibadanboy,"Nairobi, Kenya",Jul 2014,"Nusa Dua beach is a gem. Compared to the hustle & bustle you find at the busy beaches of Kuta, Legian etc, Nusa Dua is a calm oasis of peace & comfort. Fine white sand, a nice long & curving bay to the beach, never crowded (there is a security barrier to the entrance) and with a lot fewer sales people at hand. The water is calm, no surfing waves here, blue and warm most of the year. The bottom of the sea along the beach is rocky, so tread with care - or wear appropriate water shoes. Swimming is possible when the tide is right and you can get a couple of hours of warm, calm swimming in this delightful place. The beach itself is very long and you can go for romantic walks for at least a couple of kilometres. There are many 5* hotels along the beach, but they are recessed quite a distance away, so not intrusive at all. You can get a 1hour massage under cabanas for really cheap prices compared to the hotels & spas - make sure you treat yourself to one - you'll come back for more everyday! A quiet and lovely beach - one of my favourites on the island. Most highly recommended!"
WeRtheTravelers,"Kailua-Kona, HI",Jul 2014,Nice sand but the huge reef prevents waves. People can walk a long ways out and still be in shallow water.
szkut,"Kincumber, Australia",Jul 2014,"Staying in Kuta we came down here on our bikes. Upon entry just say you are having lunch at one of the resorts. Then park at one and feel free to use whichever beach. Very upmarket area similar to Denarau in Fiji but a much nicer beach area.It is a little more to stay here, but for a family or romantic couple it is what I would say as one of the better options in Bali. Depends on your taste but definitely will stay here next time."
BJcyclist,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2014,"Clean beach and very few hustlers...but do take a $10 1hr massage. We hired jet skis for 30mins, and parasailed. Good surf at a break called Sri Lanka."
harrynheather,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2014,"We stayed at the Melia Bali Resort and used both their pools and amazing private golden sand beach. When the tide is somewhere between an hour either side of full, it is amazing and great for decent swimming. It is foremost though, very very safe. Very little tide movement or current.When the tide is out, is goes out for a long time and a long way, about 600 - 700 mtrs. Overall, a magical place to stay and enjoy all there is to offer."
BulliedbyChangi,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2014,"Coming from the madness of Kuta, where most of the time you are better of walking, as we found one night when we wanted to go to Poppies 1 from the Discovery Kartika Plaza although we could have walked my daughter which has trouble walking so we diced to get a taxi and where told once in the taxi he won't take us so we gave up on that Idea.Nusa Dua is much more lay back , clean, a better section of restaurants a free shuttle running to most Hotels to the shopping centre.If I was to pick where to stay in Bali again It would be Legian, Sanur, Nusa Dua saying all that It depends on your budget , but its that old saying you only get what you pay for.love Nusa Dua If your after a relaxing holiday by the pool or beach then this is the place for you.RegardschangiarportJames"
SofiaC c,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2014,"hard to find, took us a few tries at looking for it- once you get there it is beautiful. we came on high tide and had a swim, when the tide went out we went out and looked at all the sea life such as sea snakes, sea urchins, sea weed, crabs, and much more "
Sarah W,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2014,"Steep beach but few big waves due to the outer reef. Wide bay, so space for everyone. Hawkers are allowed but not many like in Kuta. Lovely to stroll along at any time of the day; it's on the eastern edge so lovely sunrises. But there are also plenty of trees giving shade during the day, and at night the hotels have lights in them that swing in the gentle breezes"
jainprakhar,"Hyderabad, India",Jul 2014,This beach is located close to the hotels in Nusa Dua and offers white sand. The waves are calm  and the water clean. Not much crowd here. The beach is frequented by the guests of the hotels nearby.
Marcella,"Louisville, Kentucky, United States",Jul 2014,"Mengiat is a part of Nusa Dua beach. This section is near the Grand Hyatt Resort and it was absolutely my favorite beach I visited while in Bali. The water was clear, closest thing to white sand, and there was the least amount of seaweed and trash in this area. Loved it!"
marshallls28,"Alderley Edge, UK",Aug 2013,Lovely place but not the real Bali.  The whole time we were there we were desperate to get out and see the real Bali.  It was our honeymoon so we did go for extra special but that came with security and a peninsular which was manicured within an inch of its life. In hindsight it would never have been something for us as we prefer the real deal.
56RDG,"West Sussex, UK",Jun 2014,"A beautiful sandy beach and because of the reef, safe for swimming. There are boat trips and watersports available."
Applecrumbz,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2014,"The actual Westin Hotel beach front of Nusa Dua was nice and sandy as expected but the sea water was cold but still swimmable for me (Not many others would try and those that do, do not stay in long). Late afternoon time the water goes way out and it doesn't look nice. Late morning onwards when the sun comes out and water is still close is the best time to come here."
1Robbie1969,"Oldham, UK",Oct 2013,"Nusa Dua is a popular balinese destination, the beach is central to most hotels in Nusa. The beach itself is nice and long. The beach has all the usual activities, parasailing, volleyball, jet skis, wake boarding etc. My key advice is all the locals are friendly and offer additional trips, you can run a boat down to the turtle sanctuary hired straight from the beach or hire it for the day but as with the watch sellers or sarong salesman there are two prices on the beach, the tourist price and a real price always haggle its fun. In October, the beach comes alive for a week with all the local villagers arriving at the temple grounds to celebrate Diwali a hindu festival, the temple grounds are alive with culture culmanating in two or three colourful and musical nights of religious celebrations. Diwali is a must experience and dependant on your willingness to engage with the locals you will be allowed in the temple as long as you observe hindu customs."
Nikesh Vasa,"Jamnagar, India",Jun 2014,"The beach is nice with blue waters, but it is not good for swimming and just going around as it is a rocky beach and not smooth."
Iamagnes,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Dec 2013,"this was at our hotel, so easily accessible. So we did spend a lot of time on the beach. some vendors try to sell you stuff, but negotiate hard."
KaruTA,"Jurong, Singapore",Jun 2014,Nice clear water with moderate waves. Suitable for swimming & wading. Plenty of shades provided by trees with shower facilities nearby. 
Rahul G,"Candolim, India",Apr 2014,Nusa Dua is probably one of the few beaches where you can swim without any surfers around. They have all Hotels lined up on the beach. Few normal places to eat n drink but u will have to walk a lot depending which property you are staying at. The massage on the beach is good n cheap. Watersports are plenty but be careful as they dont have the best safety gear or life guards. We had a very bad experience with watersports on Nusa Dua Beach.
Erfp79,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"The beach was only okay.  Water was calm, protected by a breakwater.  But sand was a bit coarse, and there were pieces of trash floating in the ocean:(.  Water was pleasant, but very shallow at low tide, and there was lots of vegetation.  There were NO warnings about the presence of sea urchins at our hotel beach (I saw very small ones posted up-beach at other resorts after) and my foot grazed one, getting two spines in the ball of my foot as I swam.  It was extremely painful, and necessitated a trip to the local hospital.  The hospital, by the way, was LOVELY,  and the medical care there excellent (four stars to them!)."
Diane266,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,"This beach is very nice with less crowd, and clean too. We went there for our honeymoon. It is also very quiet."
Aychen S,67 contributions,Jun 2014,"White sands and quiet place to spend private time with family. At June the rocks were sharp, had to be careful with kids."
ana,"Athens, Greece",May 2014,"Very nice walking around. The water is warm but sometimes the currents are very strong, so you can not swim. It was clean and not crowded."
ChefLeongL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2013,"Nusa dua area best part is safety and lots of branded hotel and resort, nusa dua beach area is suitable surfing, so does expect fine white sand beach...forget it this area."
mrsjeanday,lichfield,May 2014,Fantastic clean soft sand beach and warm sea. Excellent  resort spotlessly clean.Everyone spoke perfect English and very polite.
David F,"London, UK",Jul 2014,"This beach is beautiful, clean and quiet. But remember that all beaches are accessible in Bali, so there is no need to limit yourself to so-called ""public"" beaches."
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,"Nusa Dua is a resort area with 5 star hotels, restaurants and shopping center.  The beach at Nusa Dua is lovely - fine white sand beaches and most of the 5 star hotels in Nusa Dua have their own stretch of nice beach.Nusa Dua is a little further away from the town area or Kuta. So you will need to hire a car or taxi if you need to go out."

ReginaldSLin,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Beautiful quiet beach, white sand, with a width of at least 20 meters at high tide, and much more when the tide goes down.  The breaking waves offshore are wonderful to watch.  I am not a surfer, but I figure surfers would have quite an enjoyable time.Closer to shore are smaller breaks, which are good enough for body surfing.The beach is peaceful.  Just pull up a sun chair, find a shady spot, and doze off hearing the natural sounds of wave pounding.Of course there are some peddlars about, but they are generally unobtrusive and not pushy.  They mainly leave you alone until you call them over."
Scott M,"Oslo, Oslo, Norway",Jun 2014,"I traveled alot trough Bali, and this beach is just like many of them. With that said, it's a very nice beach. But nothing out of the ordinary."
skakar60,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2014,"Nusa Dua is a beach  alongside which there are many luxury hotels, side by side, so you see a multitude of beach chairs and umbrellas all along. However, when we went, they were mostly unoccupied and there were very few people on the beach. So we had a liesurely swim in the cordoned off swimming areas in the sea. It is a beautiful beach with clear water and white sands, vey calm and serene!"
alan_vitali,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,Maybe it is a nice beach but the days we were there the wind was up and the waves were a bit too big for small kids
Shiping,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Very nice beach i must say. It's not too crowded (which is very good) and it's quite pretty! Even though the sand wasn't the very soft type and the water is not very clean towards the shore (but it's very blue and it's quite clear), it's still very enjoyable sitting there enjoying the sun and the wind!"
Lu1113,"London, UK",Jun 2014,"Don't go... terrible vibe...could be anywhere.  despite the nice scenery, its a poor man's Disneyland and a definite miss.  Also, note all the beach hotels are set in so I would be surprised if the accommodation views are anything to write home about."
Dennis D,"Bunbury, Australia",Mar 2014,"Nusa Dua beach is nice and all beach-facing hotels do their bit to keep the areas tidy BUT...the path along the beach seems to be non-existent in parts. Other than that, quite a pleasant walk for tourists. "
mwen97,Singapore,May 2014,Beautiful and private beach. Sand was not white but the waters were clear and blue.There weren't many people milling around and beach chairs widely spaced out. 
Colin B,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2013,"Clean, uncrowded and patrolled for privacy and security. Drinks, meals and snacks served on the beach at your own chair/daybed."
VibrantAurora,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Nusa Dua is more a chillax and private beach for families and couples. If you have energetic teens who love more vibrant activities, go to Kuta/Seminyak area. We did not like the latter as it was TOO congested for our enjoyment. To compromise, we had water sports at Tanjung Benoa - just 10 mins away from Nusa Dua. "
Aruniya,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2014,"We stayed in Sanur, but ended up here without planning it when we visited the mall. The beach is one the most beautiful beaches I have seen in Bali (I did not go to north). I believe it can be a bit dangerous in high tide but otherwise it is also great for a swim. The view is great. There are a lot of hang outs along the beach, where you can relax. I agree with other visitors that they can maintain it a bit more clean."
Mukul K,navi mumbai,May 2014,If you want to have a relaxing beach vacation then NUSA Dua is the place to go. Very clean and not crowed at all
Steven D,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Highly manicured and very clean, beach sellers not as pushy as Kuta. Great swimming pools and plenty of bars in all the hotels, beers slightly pricey."
xxPeteandLinda,"Sutherland Shire, Australia",May 2014,We had dead birds floating in the water & was told they have to remain for religious purposes. The Rip & Current was extremely dangerous. Watch your children closely. 
Franquete,"Comodoro Rivadavia, Argentina",Mar 2014,"Very nice, friendly and family beach with a nice view to the volcano.  Best Hotel in the Area, Melia."
AmeliaJayne,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"Long beach, great for walks and calm enough to swim. When the tides out the water is quite a walk away."
Sook Ling T,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,Great sight! A must visit place if u are at nusa dua. The experience is like watching the firework for the first time in disney land. The only different is that... this is a natural water blow. I just love this place.
Jean-Paul R,"Shenyang, China",May 2014,We were at the Club Med the beach lucky for us was clean 3 time per day by the Club Med staff but if you walk along the beach of Nusa Dua is was full of rubbish it was a sad view. 
sandraubillus,"Key Biscayne, FL",May 2014,I stayed in the Westin...Everything was first class... and I was able to play tennis everyday..Dany is a great teacher.
coutts44,"Rowville, Australia",May 2014,"Current can get a little strong, so just keep an eye out for the kids. This beach is really quite and relaxing. As the resorts have their own private beach, towels and food and drinks are always available as is beach lounges and umbrellas"
Guntur R,"Kuta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"Yeah, i love it.There are several beach in Nusa Dua. I know Padang-padang, dreamland, suluban beach, pandawa beach. I am falling love to Suluban beach with blue ocean with cliff, also good for surfing."
NPRW2210,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"calm, clean, blue water.. all i can say Nusa Dua Beach is an ideal beach for relaxing and swimming.. it was quite and hot but the view is really nice and you would to enjoy it so much there.. there are some massive resort around Nusa Dua Beach but that will be ok to soak up the sun!"
NeeNee_Cho,Penang,May 2014,"We did a morning cycling ride along the beach till the Nusa Dua Hope garden. There were lots to explore along the beach, beautiful photo shooting spots, local candi, hotel deco and the nice garden towards the end of the cycling path."
Sir WS,"Kajang, Malaysia",May 2014,"Nothing spectacular, but I guess some people like it quieter than a crowded beach like Kuta. The best spots are owned by hotels/resorts and the section with public access is nothing to shout about. It lacks shades from the scorching hot sun other than the chargeable loungers. It's not a place that I would regret not visiting.Generally a quiet and clean beach, suitable for early mornings or around sunsets."
pan k,"Famagusta, Cyprus",Jan 2014,"maybe the best beach in bali ( clean) very quiet not much to do.good for 4,5 days maybe all the beach have big hotels that have there omprelas and sunbed on the  beach"
Christine D,"Preston, UK",May 2014,Liked everything about the place except for the 2 sea snakes which we saw. The beach was cleaned everyday and there were plenty of loungers to relax on.
Carmel D,3 contributions,May 2014,The beach was very inviting.  It is cleaned every day but we walked along it one day whilst the sea was at high tide and quite a lot pollution was being washed up.  Coming from Australia we decided to make more use of the hotel pools rather than the beach.
Jacintha N,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2014,"I went there in the evening and the sunset was lovely. Unlike the Kuta beach, the Nusa Dua beach is a lot smaller and quieter. There are no surfers or much activities happening there. Great for a peaceful chill out evening. "
JanetM075,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2014,Nowhere to sit. Sharp shells and coral. Not very clean. Not many good swimming areas. We only went there once and avoided this beach.
ginarti,Jakarta,Jun 2013,"We went to water blow, it was located in a very nice and well maintained environment. A very nice place to visit in the afternoon and enjoy the sunset.  "
mochacoffee44,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,Close to the bali collection and beachside restaurants.nice and breezy in the shade while you enjoy a meal. Has a pool for the kids aswell as lounge chairs and tables on the sand.
Yen A,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2014,"I had made a booking with my driver before i went there so the price was cheaper and fixed. Otherwise they will charged u in USD. The beachboys was very friendly and helpful. The most annyoying thing was those lady who force you to buy souvenier from them. Dont ask them if you dont want to buy,or else they will follow you anywhere."
bonjourajat,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2013,"the watersports are very good and are performed middle of sea giving you a thrilling experience.I really liked gold fish which takes u up in the sir lying on a bedlike surface and then suddenly put you down of sea surface. I didnt like banana boat as those drivers are not trustworthy and will turn the boat down in the water in spite of your request to them. Though , they keep u safe and do it to give u thrilling fun"
Pat P,"Helensvale, Australia",Jan 2014,very relaxing because the hawkers aren't allowed there. Only downside was having to get the shuttle from the hotel
Pris,"Riau Province, Indonesia",Dec 2013,"Strolling around the museum, the peace park, and wait for the big water splash. The rows of ""duwet"" trees give a tangy flavour to taste when in its seasons.  "
Malcolm C,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2014,"Swimming at the beach was like swimming in a hot bath.  The beach was generally clean, with little visible rubbish."
ccsclwns7773,"Tiverton, UK",Apr 2014,"This is a beach away from the rough surf and rip tides of Legian and Kuta and is safer for swimming. There are less people on this beach than legian and thus many less sellers harassing you for massages or knick-knacks you dont really want.I was able to hire two sunbeds and a umbrella for 50000 Indonesia ruppea (about ¬£3.30) and enjoy the calm waters and golden sand, although i did have to pay for the taxi ride which was 500000 ruppea (¬£25) , it was still worth it not to be thrown about by the big waves and currents on the Legian side of the coast."
amin a,25 contributions,Apr 2014,"the beach was clean and quite you can relax and enjoy the beach without any crowd, if you with a kids i think it was a perfect beach to play "
mschmidt83,"Martha's Vineyard, MA",Apr 2014,"Water was perfect temp and clean watch out for the coral under foot though ! ..  nice to body surf some good waves ... the beach itself is very nice, clean with beautiful sand..  a beautiful beach all up"
Frankascanbe,"Dublin, Ireland",Apr 2014,Small waves so great for young kids but as with all of Bali's beeches the water is populated by plastic rubbish although this beech seemed to have the least. The sand here is clean as the hotels have it raked over every day.
Laura S,"Doreen, Victoria, Australia",Mar 2014,Beautiful & clean in comparison to kuta. No black sand that's to hot to walk on. You also do not get harassed as much. 
Kelvin K,"Markham, Canada",Mar 2014,"Being a private beach, Nusa Dua Beach is definitely the cleanest in Bali. There are people constantly raking the sand and taking out any floating garbage from the Ocean.Very relaxing beach with very few hawkers to bother you."
charisma219,"Lawrence, MA",Mar 2014,"Nusa Dua Beach is just an okay beach. There is a good amount of beach front. The sand is a medium coarseness and brown.  When you step into the water it is also sandy, which is nice to not step on rocks or corals.  The water is warm and calm.  There are not a lot of waves. At low tide, the water completely disappears and is pulled back several hundred feet which occurred every afternoon during our stay.  It is not a beach that you can snorkel either.  It is nice beach to swim and do water sports such as kayaking or paddleboating."
DC44th,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2014,"Absolutely gorgeous beaches and nice town with a small ""Bali Connection"" center full of restaurants and shops. Perfect for a quiet family holiday."
Marc M,"Charlotte, NC",Oct 2013,"Like most beaches in Indonesia, there is nice scenery, but once you get up close, you see a lot of trash. The resorts on the beach are incredible, and the bike path is a nice idea, BUT it is not continuous, so there are times you have to walk the bike through the sand or else up / down steps."
Nachiket S,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2014,"The Nusa Dua is ideally for swimming, the tides are gentle, the water is blue, the beach is clean. Some of the beaches are private for the hotels, but it has couple of stretched which are public and accessible easily.  "
Serh I,11 contributions,Feb 2014,"Nice place to swim without big waves, ideal place for swim with babies. It's sand beach with big amount of tourists. You can surfing or kayaking or snorkling or get massage.  "
Caroline S,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2014,"Nice and clean and relatively free of hawkers.  I noticed some with numbered blue shirts, I wonder if these people have to obtain a permit to trade?"
WorldGlutton,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2014,"From the Nugurah Rai International Airport, is a 15 mins drive through the Toll with RP10000 to Nusa Dua Beach.The atmosphere at Nusa Dua Beach with its beauty , safety & comfort complement by  not only star rated hotels but facilities ranges from sports, recreations , culture and shopping center as well as convention centre , make it a prime venue alternative for all International Events. Staying here for Conference in the Resort Hotel,  I am fascinated by the fresh & beautiful tropical environment , the high level of security, the warm hospitality and its balinese traditional culture & activities  along this beach .Nusa Dua beach has a long white sand beach, beautiful flora & fauna, & a magnificient view of sky  over the Indian Ocean.  From the tourists to the local visitors that i came across at this Beach, between society & natural environment..its truly a place of  Peace, Love & Beauty !!!!"
Suzi W,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,"Likes: Very clean, calm, beach hawkers all registered and controlled so not so annoying, southern end is a bay and appears safe for children, good security"
kuota,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2014,"It has been 20 years since we have been here and obviously there has been some development! Of course we remember just how relatively expensive it was back then and there was nothing else here except a few resorts in the middle of nowhere. But now its a thriving hub of most other of the things you would find at Kuta and Sanur. The good news is that massages are actually cheaper here than in Kuta! The beach is very very good for Bali (being a volcanic island) with gorgeous warm waters and very calm for kids to enjoy. The water sports do not hamper the swimming much we found unless you wanted to do some long distance open water swimming, but its perfect for kids and young families."
Ketut Gde P,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2014,"Since years this beach is always a stunning white sandy beach for sun rice between two peninsula called ""Nusa Dua"" (Two Small Island). Now days this place is one of the world famous beach for tourist from allover the world. Along the beach I found many happiness tourist whom enjoyed the sun, laying on the grass and sand, as most of the five star resort is located in this area. Having chat with local vendor to over a souvenir and traditional massage on the beach with only 50-100K for an hour treatment. Sun rise at 06:15 am from the Jetty looks fantastic. Beach is clean and free from the hassle, local vendor will not disturb while we enjoyed our time at the resort."
Cathy L,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2014,Hotels in nusa  dua has all the security and serenity of a gated community ( which it really is not) beach beautiful in the usual Balinese style but very clean and hassle free unlike the beaches in Kuta or Jimbaren. 
sinner5,"White Rock, Canada",Mar 2014,"As opposed to other beaches in Bali, this one is meticulously cleaned by the resorts.  This is a beach for the early risers as the sun rises over the horizon here since it's located on the east part of the peninsula.The water is shallow and sheltered... It is safe for children and weak swimmers.This is a beach for families and those looking for minimal hassles... even if it is a little ""sterile""..."

everythingineed,"Calgary, Canada",Jan 2014,"so beautiful and so clean, the pedlars didn't bother you if you said no, a quick walk along the beach to a great mall with great restaurants"
Sean_Lam,"Phu Quoc Island, Vietnam",Oct 2013,"A long stretch of clean, quite and beautiful beach open exclusively to guests at the many 5 star resorts in the area. The upside is that the beach is safe, clean and manned by security guards round-the-clock. Also you will never never go hungry or thirty because of the ample (albeit over-priced) restaurant and bar options around. What's missing is however the local Balinese flavour. You will hardly see any locals in this area. My advice to all fellow travellers - there is no shame enjoying the comfort of this sterile world, but remember also try exploring other areas on the island to experience the real Bali."
Chailey_Paul,"North Chailey, UK",Feb 2014,"The beach even looks man made. Security guards every few metres is unsettling. Row up row of beach beds, change of colour or style tells you that you are the next hotel. No real people."
Yeliz A,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2014,"I came in February which is the low season of tourist in Bali. It was actually great although it did not have sunshine all the time (but sometimes pretty strong sunshine), I feel pretty comfortable to swim at that time. The beautiful blue water made me feel like I'm dreaming :) I miss the beach there~ "
AlexTRJ,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Feb 2014,"Most part of Nusa Dua beach is actually not open to the public, its only reserved for the guests of the numerous 5 stars hotels in that area. However there are 2 stretches that are accessible by public so if you are not staying in one of the hotels in Nusa Dua but you want to check out the beach, ask your driver to bring you there.Both stretches of beach are beautiful, quiet and clean. The left side beach are mostly filled with huts, beach chairs whereas the right side beach is mostly empty.When you walk towards the right side beach, behind the beach are the cool drink bars and huts for you to grab your drink.This area is perfect if you just want to get some suntan peacefully, or chill out on the beach with some drinks or a book. Definitely hundred times better than Kuta beach. If you are in Bali, don't miss out on Nusa Dua beach."
nunomgomes,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2014,Went to the beach a couple of times and was OK. I felt like I was in soup as it was nice and warm. There was hardly anyone at the beach so I had a bit of piece and quiet.
Jenny J's Travel,"Gunsan, South Korea",Jan 2014,just check my facebook for picturesjust check my facebook for picturesjust check my facebook for pictures
spdang,"Phuket, Thailand",Feb 2014,"Well it is quite because Nusa Dua is kind of an isolated area for holiday resorts surrounded by gates with guards. It might sound negative at first but in fact going to the beach with nobody there to harass you trying to sell something to you can be quite nice too. As for the beach itself, not fantastic, clean but not so beautiful as compared to Thailand or even Vietnam. We visited more beautiful beaches in Asia. "
Tarja79,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Feb 2014,"beach was great on site massage,drinks and food right on your lounger we enjoyed ice cold bintang but would not op for the massage the ladies didn't look great mid age on wards  "
AJ9889,"Palangkaraya, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"I love the beach, it's beautiful because there's a private beach area which is connected to hotels, and the public area. In public beach area, we can find many souvenirs sold by locals, many traditional foods & snacks which is cheap. But nothing we can do more than just walking around, have a sit, reading books, enjoy the view, swimming or tasting the local foods. While in private beach which is connected to the hotel, it's private, we can do water sport or just go to snorkeling with the boat. then, it's more comfort to sunbathing or just relaxing on the private beach because only hotel guests who can enter it."
LFLLFL,Sydney,Jan 2014,"The beach is amazing.Very warm, very clean.Plenty of places to buy food and drink.And get massages.Definitely worth a visit or 2."
Gracie B,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2014,"Went there with a friend just to have a good time with each other, I really loved this beach, very relaxing and had a great time with my friend."
EbruED,"Istanbul, Turkey",Feb 2014,"Sea was ideal for surfers instead of swimmers, cause it was very shallow, good for kids though. Liked it anyways, sided by a rocky area, where we all enjoyed collecting lots of sea shells.. "
Brian L,"Arlington, Virginia, United States",Feb 2014,"Went during the rainy season (first week in Feb), but the beach was pretty empty and the water was perfect for swimming in (warm and calm waters)."
duvu,"Stockholm, Sweden",Feb 2014,The scenery was wonderful. Felt very relaxing at the beach. However not good for swimming at low tide due to a lot of rocks and seaweed. 
adi035,"Brasov, Romania",Oct 2013,"Beach near the ocean is made up of fine sand and hot. Sunbeds and umbrellas are placed on toward the land, landscaped with grass. Along the beach there are terraces and pools, very well furnished."
ZuZ85,"Beirut, Lebanon",Jan 2014,"Great private beach with clear waters and white sands. Lots of activities to do, make sure that you ask for a lower price."
MMMMG,"Buhl, Germany",Jul 2013,Great beaches are getting uncovered especially in the rocky stretches of the sea shore around noon when the low tide comes. Walking or snorkeling in the shallow reefs enjoys not only children.
JCordovilla,"Malaga, Spain",Feb 2014,"When the tide is high it is safe for the kids.When it is low, they can explore the sands and reefs.It's a perfect place to go with young children."
GilesB71,"Newton Abbot, UK",Mar 2013,fine sand and enough shelter. Good food available and useful guys selling cheap stuff and hair braiding etc
Pija Lalu,"Nan, Thailand",Jan 2014,"Very good with a long walkway along the beach, that also good for biking. Not so many people on the beach when compared with Semiyak or Kuta. "
Wendong-LEE,"Beijing, China",Feb 2014,"compared with Kuta beach, this beach is fabulous. sand is fine, water mild. many water sports. considering the other things' prices here, water sports are expensive. people mostly recommend water motor and jet fish. Here, sand and water are good for children to play. just be careful of the boats coming in and out and, leaving less and less shallow water area for kids."
familycat,kiwi in Melbourne,Apr 2013,"Given that the beach is part of the resort complex, it is kept pristine, with workers regularly patrolling the beach and keeping it postcard perfect. Hawkers are licensed, so although you will be approached to buy a sarong or kite or whatever, there are not many of them, and they are respectful.It's not great to swim at high tide or when the tide is coming in as lots of rubbish gets brought in on the tide. As the tide goes out, the rubbish clears away. The water is beautiful."
648Explorer648,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2013,"If you looking for nice clear blue beach go to Nusa Dua Area  (not in Seminyak, or Legina or Kuta it was a disaster there.)"
G S,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2013,This beach is amazing as it is not too packed which makes it more relaxing and fun.  The beach was clean and we had a great time.  Miss it already.
Lisa M,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",May 2013,"Great beach with white sand , very relaxing with nice tropical gardens. Great for a family. We stayed at Novotel Nusa Dua & they had there own private beach & great resturant . Loved it"
Mandy Q,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2013,"Nothing special about the Nusa Dua beach, overall not particularly impressive. Like Bali's mountain areas more."
Yu Q,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Nov 2013,"I loved the beach so much!!!! coz of the time we went, there weren't many people at all. it was so relaxing and peaceful. "
Piotrowski1969,"Andover, UK",Jan 2014,"We surfed here on many occasions on our visit, there are quite a few beaches here and it does stretch some way.  Lots of bars and cafe's along the way, the beauty of this beach is you can walk along with out being hassled to buy anything..  there are little stalls, and places to get massages on the beach all very reasonebly priced.  very safe place to walk around,"
Henrykoci,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2014,"not so much wave and not too crowded like Kuta and you don't find so much people offering products.Good for Family, no prostitutes hanging around looking for white guys. most of them are those taken from Kuta by single lonely man and since this area has more visitors with family so you don't see that often."
Duwi M,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2014,"Hi everyone,This is my first review on tripadvisor.comFirstly, I do apologize for my bad English.. yaah it's because English is not my mother language but I'll try my best :)Well, do you wanna go to Nusa Dua Beach while in Bali? Then that's a good plan. White sand, low tides, no big waves, perfect for swimming especially for your kids. There are many activities you can do there. Jogging and cycling track, football, beach volleyball, nice fishing spots, surfing, and one amazing attraction called water blow. Just come and see by yourself :)"
Anna M,Moscow,Jan 2014,No big waves and low-tides are not that visible. Long yellow sand beach is also ideal for walking. Great for kids!
MoJ,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2014,"So if you not into the crazy partying and huge crowds this area of Bali would be for you. First up beautiful resorts located in a secluded gated area. I stayed at the Sofitel NUSA DUA. The beach fr me was in a lot better condition than Padang Padang or Dreamland for that matter, This coming from a cleanliness position. great for swimming. If you do feel like getting out to Kuta for some shopping or experiencing the tourist hustle and bustle a cab ride will cost about 20 USD one way. There is an open air mall called Bali collection and most resorts provide free transport but i must warn you that this over priced but has some decent resturants worth trying out. Dont use the massage services theres cause hey a little expensive. If you venture out of the gates you will find a little street shopping area where you can find great bargins and try out Zahras SPA for some RR. She also provides pic up and drop of services for free. All in all i would split my next trip between Seminyak,Nusa Dua and Ubud."
alf0012010,"Houston, TX",Jan 2014,Great beach for couples and families alikePos- not too many people (private hotel beaches)- calmNeg-  coarser sand
Terry M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2014,At times lots of seaweed and some floating rubbish. Not really pretty but also not a bad beach. Nice to have a rest and a drink in one of the many 5-star hotels located there.
SwissJ70,"Warwick, UK",Jan 2014,Nothing special but cleaner than Kuta and SeminyakNo really choice for a drink at a local bar - dominated by hotels and expensive bar & food prices
Sancher H,"Port Stephens, Australia",Feb 2013,"relaxing, peaceful, great place to be and the locals beach is great also. Clean water, try a lemon squash at The Hyatt for the best thirst quenching drink - they put a fresh lemon grass in each drink."
Carolmm1,"Harare, Zimbabwe",Dec 2013,"pristine beaches,water was very warm and pleasant to spend the day in just catching the waves,they rank second to the maldives in my list"
Joeyboy J,3 contributions,Nov 2013,"paradise of its own, white sand and clear water plus the waves perfect for surfing. 5 star hotels are popular in this area though a bit far from where the action is."
Elizabeth C,"New York City, NY",Dec 2013,"Beach is clean, well maintainted, and water is beautiful.  Much nicer than Seminyak and no hawkers trying to sell you junk! "
c0sm0p0litangirl,indonesia,Feb 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is as lovely as other beaches in Bali. I went to this secret spot, more like private, and it was nice, not too crowded, enjoy the wave!"
paulajab,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2013,"The ONLY beach to travel too during the Rainy season in Bali.  The other beaches we visited were exceptionally dirty.  Nusa Dua resort beach of Marriott Courtyard was very nice.  With service staff, and beach chairs- surf lessons- shopping- etc.  You don't have to leave your chair! "
tumbleweed5,"Columbus, OH",Dec 2013,Very sad that the beaches were not kept up. Must have been a nice beach 15 years ago.  Trash was everywhere and lots of water sports going on.  Looks like accidents could happen easily. 
Chandra A,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2013,"Enjoyed just being in the water. The place is so clean, the walking pathways neat, local people are very friendly. It was just a pleasure. We went to the beach early at 6Am and just lost count of time:)"
Priyanka R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2013,"If you are looking for a clean beach that has no hawkers pestering you to take massages, buy icecream & beads, Nusa Dua is certainly the place.Fell in love with the beach here. Unlike Legion-Kuta, this beach is cleaner. Unlike Balangan, the water is calmer & the sand is finer."
Christine651,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,Whole beach area spotlessly clean and safe.   Toss-up whether to swim in beach or resort pools.   Great walking/cycling track all along beaches in front of resorts.   Lots of eats and drinks available along the way.
Christine C,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,"Unrestricted access along beach walkway, first class accommodation.   Just a wonderful happy atmosphere and awesome beach.  Lots of things to do in area."
Ulissethetraveller,"Rome, Italy",Nov 2013,"You go to the beach only if you are staying in a beach facing hotel. the beach is nice although colonized by the hotels, and the swimming is poor. Water is shallow, with a nice coral and seaweed reef, but no real swimming. Head south to the island's southern tip for a more genuine beach."
Clarence C,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,Nice place to go for walks....Must see it at both high and low tides. Cycling along the entire stretch from Club Med to St Regis is also highly reccomended.
wheeder,"Alexandria, Virginia",Dec 2013,The Nusa Dua beach is white sand and very clean. The beach in not overly crowded. Several hotels have responsibility to maintain the beach near their properties and in most cases the beach is very well maintained.
fsien,Jakarta,Dec 2013,The beach is not too crowded like Kuta or Legian. The beach is cleaner with white sands. Though not much water activities here but it is a perfect place to just sit idling all day
eugenexsamantha,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,"We visited Nusa Dua beach on 19 December 2013. This is a summary of our visit: What we like:- There were hotels offering lounge chairs by the beach so you can join in and order some drinks and laze. The hotels did not seem very exclusive to me if we could just walk in, without being a hotel guest. - Water was clear. What we did not like: - No fishes at all! No opportunity to do any snorkelling. - There were jellyfishes spotted - watch out or you may be stung by one!- There was somewhat watersport activities but at expensive prices offered by ad-hoc vendors sitting by the beach. My husband enquired for jetski and he was quoted USD$55 for 30 minutes - not sure if this is the normal rate but it seemed quite pricey so we did not go ahead. - We saw a couple renting a kayak and they went kayaking but there seemed to be no regulations whatsoever. The couple were not wearing any life vests which is very dangerous. In addition, we later spotted them kayaking way past the lifebuoys and they appeared to be kayaking on the same spot as the current was very, very strong. There were no lifeguards present or anyone we could even remote approach to help the couple."
NVJ_12,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2013,The beach was very clean where you can either do a lot of water sports or maybe just sit back and relax.
elsiek,London,Dec 2013,"Nice beach - much cleaner than Sanur - with light coloured sand and easy to walk out to either of the small islands that give Nusa Dua (Dua = two) its name. Fine clean sand. Flanked by a pathway to take you past all the big hotels that make up this area. Don't be put off by the signs put out by those big hotels saying it is ""their"" beach. Our guide told us it is accessible to all and promptly marched across the supposedly private, exclusive Hyatt sand without problem. Lots of local food available as are water sports and sunchairs/umbrellas"
ujjwal13987,"Delhi, Delhi, India",Nov 2013,nothing to dislike but try to bargain as much as possible as the locals who take you for water sports will ask you a lot where as you can take from them in less than half wat they offer and same goes for street shopping or can say for ubud shopping tour if you are going.
Amy92y,"Coonamble, Australia",Aug 2013,"Nice beach, quieter than Kuta. One of the cleaner ones too.Water is clear, wasn't really a surf beach which meant it wasn't as crowded ( when we went anyway). Nice cafes close by too :)"
shangyu x,"Beijing, China",Nov 2013,"I like swim in the pool near the beach, when you are tired, there is a bar in the middle of the pool, you can sit in the stone seat in the pool , enjoy the fresh juice and cocktail...see the sea view...it's enjoyable"
DJJPerth,Perth,Nov 2013,I LOVE the people watching at Nusa Dua beach. The water is lovely and clean and lots of walks along the beach. Its magic !
JB0489,"Glasgow, UK",Nov 2013,We found this a great place to relax as it was very quiet compared with some of the other Bali beaches. Great for a walk along the water and plenty of little restaurants for drinks and some lunch. We got a lounger no problem and it cost us next to nothing for the full day. The water was shallow and calm which was a lovely change from the beach at Legian which was better suited to surfing. The sand was lovely and qhite and very clean. Would recommend eating in one of the small cafes by the beach so reasonable and the food was great.
2014FpvGt,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2013,Very clean. Whiter sand than Kuta beach. Not to many people. Easy enter to many restaurants and bars. Calmer waters for kids. Great place to do all the water sports or watch from a bar area. Last week there was several big cruise ships to look at just of the shore.
SujoyMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2013,"Visited Nusa dua beach in early November and stayed at the marriott. Most of the hotels have their own private strip and we were at the courtyard marriott area where the hotel has sundecks, and a beach club for drinks and snacks. The beach us quiet with no hawkers. You can just lie and gaze at the ocean. There is a low tide in the evenings so the sea is far away with still water left at the edge of the beach, so not a great place to go into the water, but great to lie down with a book or just laze."
OzzieMuse,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2013,It was clean without a lot of junk on the sand. Didn't swim but it looked like it was ok to do so when the tide was high. Plenty of people in the water. Very calm ocean so it would be ok for children to play in the water with their parents.
Wolf L,"Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland",Oct 2013,"Not being a real and enthusiast beach guy, I spent some time and evenings at the Nusa Dua Beach and beyond the hotel part. The beach here is clean and well maintained (as far as I could see, on a daily basis). Besides bathing and sport facilities, it offers various bars and nice footpaths along the beach. During night walks there were always security guards on duty. Don't miss such opportunities."
Jenn_Sweden,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2013,"You need to go far to get to deeper water. And lots of small corals at the bottom near the beach, so it is difficult for children to step in..."
LadyVoyager2013,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2012,wonderful beach to sit and watch the sun rise over archipelego. only downside was the scary tsunami warning signs everywhere
Paulus K K,"Bandung, Indonesia",Sep 2013,I found the Nusa Dua beach is just an average one.the view and waves are not spectacular.seemed not a nice beach for swimming.
cliffandjo,"Wroughton, UK",Oct 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is very clean and quiet, the sea is very calm so easy to swim in.All in all its not a busy beach like Kuta and is only used by the tourists in the hotels.  There are not many beach vendors which makes it a stress free experience.If you are looking for the beach party scene probably not one for you but if you just want to chill and not be hassled then this could be the beach for you."
thechipman0,"Margate, UK",Nov 2012,"Lots of hawkers but stay within the hotels designated area where only certain ones are allowed, you will have no problem."
Perth_family_guy,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2013,A choice of beach activities from all the resorts. The beach is cleaned in front of the resorts daily.
Southernqt72,"Houston, TX",Oct 2013,see my review on the Westin.  It explains how unglued the water is during low tide.  Looks like a swamp.  Water not very clear.  But that could be just where we weree
yonhohoho,"Manchester, UK",Oct 2013,"If we compared with popular public beach in Bali like Kuta or Sanur, this beach gives more privacy.  Located in Nusa Dua area with 5 stars hotel around, this beach is quite clean and gives relaxing atmosphere. You can just walk around or just sit and enjoy sunrise without any disturbance or crowd."
Sal P,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is primarily accessed by people in the 5 Star resorts in Nusa Dua (which are in general fantastic). However , for a beach-loving Aussie, the beach itself is nothing special. It is clean and hassle free, and for kids who don't like waves it is good for swimming. However, the sand is average and the water not too clear. It also has a nice long boardwalk that is perfect for a morning or afternoon stroll, and is dotted with crafty stalls and massage huts. Dont waste your money with a massage at the resort - the huts are often just as good, albeit somewhat public and definitely lacking the air conditioning the spas usually offer."
Ann W,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Oct 2013," lovely beach very clean with smallish waves, and not anyone hassling you to buy stuff.  Would go again."
Amu S,Pune,Oct 2013,"its good if you are staying at any of the hotels on the beach otherwise, suggest to avoid unless u want to go to the turtle island"
sundaram g,bali,Aug 2013,"Nusa Dua Beach is located at the extreme South of the island of Bali in an area completely dedicated to 5 star hotels, the beach as such is one of the cleanest in Bali and is ideal for families with young children as there is plenty of shade and practically no waves.Nusa Dua Beach is the perfect example that with a little willingness and effort all public places in Bali could be kept clean tidy and pleasant to the eye."
ahmed s,"Cairo, Egypt",Sep 2013,very nice beach clean and not to much wave but not as it looks in pictures very quit beach clean  take a wake on the sand in front of the hotels very nice
Staffymax,"Sorrento, Australia",Oct 2013,"Clean waters and pristine sand, not many people as it was a private part of the Nusa Dua Novotel.They were putting in a beach path while we were there which should be really good!"
Gezginkafa h,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jun 2013,"to  enjoy an amazing sea, you need to go early in the morning. otherwise it's wavy and seems dirty.wonderful sand and peaceful"
srihartamas,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2013,"Almost deserted, the portion of the beach was specially for Mercure Nusa Dua  guest. So unlike Kuta Beach which was overcrowded and full of vendors and busy traffic. Nusa Dua's beach is so pristine and windy, you could sleep the time away and just do nothing. A place to be with yourself."
SouthAfrica-Pretoria,South Africa,Sep 2013,"Beach are very busy with boats, not a great swimming area. The beach at Kuta much better for swimming."
Jon L,"Port Orange, FL",Nov 2012,"We liked the relaxing atmosphere, the landscape of the hotel grounds, the food, the service, the beach."
Abimanyu Malewar,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2013,"Beach looks beautiful, aligned with all the high end hotels. Water is extremely shallow. Really cant swim here. Food and drinks have to bought from from one of the hotel bars or restaurants. Good place if you just want to sun bathe and relax by the beach."
Derris L,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jun 2013,"Imagine nobody is here, a sandy beach to yourself, well not at all possible, too crowded, watch when you are going, you bound to step on someone half buried under the sand. A beach ideal for a quick dip and surfing, but unfortunately some hotels monopolise the better part"
ashuc,"Island of Malta, Malta",Sep 2013,Very clam and serene but don't come here if you want waves. It is maybe very unlike other beaches with no breakers but safe and clean. Lots of Luxury hotels are on the beach so you wont be sp
lee n,adelaide,May 2013,tidal beach- swim at risk in between floating foreign matter unknown objects windsurfing equipment old and outdated canoes just float -dont go out too far- could be a long swim in
KimandTodd,"Trowbridge, UK",Sep 2013,"Lovely sandy beach, few pebbles, lovely warm sea.  Plenty of sunbeds and very attentive staff at the Melia Hotel.  A few beach sellers toting sarongs, and jewellery"
thejoneses4218,"Mermaid Waters, Australia",Aug 2013,Best at high tide although still pleasant at low tide but always clean and staff at the beach were only too willing to assist.
SSLOVEKK,"El Paso, TX",Oct 2012,It's one of the best beach at Bali island. The scenic there is beatiful. It's very suitable to hang out and play for the family. But the sand is not soft enough :)
JMc_on_the_go,"Santa Cruz, CA",Sep 2013,Great views on this expansive beach. Some litter detracted from the ambiance. Was good to visit after the hotels organized a massive clean up. Lot's of surf board rentals but saw no surfers. 
Shas74,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2013,"Beach is clean and just shallow enough, kids love it a lot, they just want to spend entire day . . . Out in the sun"
johlin-13,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2013,"very expensive,$65 us  2pax to turtle island .we stopped to have a snorkel 200 yards from beach with about ten boats around a pontoon did a ten foot circle of the coral outcrop and that was it. the sea walkers were below us. a fifteen foot footpath under water with a hand rail,the top of their helmets were two inches under water.I think that activity cost $90us make up your own minds about that,turtle island was fine though."
Mumu,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2013,It is a simple beautiful beach with white sandFrom there you can see some kind mangrove island and a lot of private beach belongs to few hotelsIf you take a walk a bit you can see Ramayana statue  
ChuckOfAllTrades,"Goa, India",Aug 2013,"Pristine clean water and sand. Quiet, not too many people. Stunning views. There's also a small elevated area with a garden - if you explore a little, you find some excellent views. No idea what this area is called, sadly - but do check out my photos, and you'll see what I mean.Perfect place to lie down for a couple of hours and read with a Kindle. Enjoy the waves and the oh so gorgeously blue waters..."
Joefromsg,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,Have to spend an hour or two here. Like the clear sea water at this beach. Great to spend a relaxing time on this clean nice and quiet beach
999Lily999,"Luxembourg City, Luxembourg",Aug 2013,"Clean, safe, very good for small kids. Local sellers on the beach friendly and not annoying. Hotel security ascertains customers' peace and privacy. The ""Golden Cage"" as locals call this area of luxury hotels."
rockyEssex,essex,Aug 2013,"Quite crowded,  could never get a bit of shade,  all the other hotels had plenty of sunbeds free etc,  but had to get down there before the crowd,  they were going down at 7am to put towels on the beds"
SiskaOS,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Apr 2013,"Well... nusa dua beach is a nice beach actually...but lately the condition is not good anymore. Several of plastics, bottle are everywhere. I hope we'll back to have a beautiful beach like a few years ago"
Luc L,"Westport, CT",Jul 2013,we live in AU on the beach - so average by standards. low tide exposes a huge coral reef. spent more time in the pool area
Debbie T,Kirkland,Jul 2013,"We found the Nusa Dua beaches to be dirty, including the beach area which was strewn with litter and the water.  "
Wendy F,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,"This is a very pretty bay that is safe to swim, the tide does go out quite far but fishing and rock-pooling in the shallows are fun. There is very little litter at this end and the sellers are not allowed to hassle on the beach, a polite No thank you will suffice."
Nins,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2013,"The beaches here are glorious  with white soft sand and safe for swimming. The public beach is the best to head to if you are not staying at Nusa Dua.It has loads of activities on the beach like flying fish, donut, banana boat, jet ski, para sailing and many more. The beach is at its best when it‚Äôs sunny to have a view of beautiful hues of water. There are massage facilities, restaurant, locker facility, shower facility also available. You can have a gala time here."
Shuan1984,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,"Nusa Dua, is paradise. The beach has fine, clean sand and the ocean was sparkling clear- amazing how far you can walk out!! Cloudless skies and cool winds also made the beach a perfect place to spend a full day there. Such amazing quality was unexpected as my first memory of Bali's beach was the complete opposite (had stayed at Kuta)."
Piv14_13,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2013,The beach is best visited in the morning as the tide goes out  around 2ish. The water is very clean although you need to watch out for the rocks - I stubbed my big toe on a sharp rock - ouch! You must also visit the blowhole which is walking distance up a small lookout
Somchai71,"Chonburi, Thailand",Aug 2013,"The section we were staying on was maintained by the resort hotels that run along it and was spotless and at low tide there is a load of puffer fish can be found in the seaweed in the shallow water. If you take goggles you can find hermit crabs, sea urchins (not many but watch your step) and baby lobsters. No hawkers on our section either but if you go up to the public section there are a few but if you're not interested and politely refuse they'll wander on and leave you alone."
WahanaBali,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2013,nusa dua beach is the best beach in Bali.people who visit this beach will find relaxing and peaceful ..
susmaya,Sweden,Aug 2013,The Hawkers and beach vendors are few here so you get to relax in the sun for once! The sea is calm and no big vawes so its ideal for kids. A bit windy tho during our stay but its nice with a breeze.
KathleenCards,"Evesham, UK",Aug 2013,The beach is beautiful in front of the Hyatt however the public part is not cleaned therefore rubbish is collected when the tide is up and floats in the sea despite the hotels doing their best to clean up the sandy part of their beach. 
erkwan,"Sidoarjo, Indonesia",Aug 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is still quite n natural. In most of the time we Had our holiday,I n my fam stayed in Benoa n Nusa Dua. The beach is nice for my kidz playing,swimming n snorkling. For snorkling we found one nice Spot in Nusa Dua,especially a long the new development area such as Regis,Ayodya. In that area,my husband n my boy having a nice snorkling. So,bring your snorkling in that beach."
Drew Jones,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2013,A patrolled beach - just swim between the flags.  Safe for kids and the water is good.  They could use a beach cleaner to improve it but it is ok and not too much coral in the sand.
Alan L,"Hong Kong, China",Aug 2013,"Very good beach, mostly owned by private hotels, could be a little cleaner. A lot of activities to do!"
mariamarsianad,"Banjarmasin, Indonesia",Jun 2013,"Our journey in Bali on June 25-27, 2013 enjoyable. We spent our time to visit Nusa Dua Beach. Where we go there is Restaurant Bebek Bengil here in the bay view. Very quiet, clean beach, we just visited, not stay in Nusa Dua Beach, because we have stayed in Kuta. We spent our time enjoyable. Welcome & visit Nusa Dua Beach, Bali"
Sarah D,186 contributions,Jan 2013,We hired a jetski and it was fantastic. My partner also really enjoyed the surf. He did lots of cool tricks on his surfboard because he is really good. 
Johnny_Brockmann,"Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Sep 2012,The private beach at Nusa Dua is owned by several 5 star hotel at the area . The beach is very quiet and clean . We can enjoy the beach although not stay in the hotel
Holtinspain,"Sotogrande, Spain",Aug 2013,"Private, clean, well groomed and clear water. Perfect!Couldn't have asked for more. Snorkel straight from the beach."
Tom F,4 contributions,Aug 2013,"such a nice beach! white sand...clear water! quite rare in bali! unfortunately, it is totally taken by big hotels. even the beach was empty, the security told us that the beach only for hotel guests......what happened to the paradise bali.....? bali - only for rich people!"
Gill B,Adelaide,Aug 2013,"Everything, just be aware the eat as much as you like buffet can be expensive. Beach is fantastic and always very clean. Staff in the hotel are amazing."
Crofton M,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Aug 2013,Nusa Dua beach runs along the front of various time share and resort properties.  In the front of some properties they have taken care of rubbish and their pathways.  Others are not very tidy and there are breaks along the beachwalk in front of undeveloped properties.  Floating rubbish is common
cclombok,"Lombok, Indonesia",Jul 2013,"When you need a secluded, nice, white sand and clean beach, this is the place to go! You won't find a lot of beach hawkers here, which you will experience if you go to Kuta. Nice view also over the Nusa Lembongan island."
Peter C,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2013,"Clean shallow water, nice warm quiet waters. Hawkers not too pushy. Amazing sand that the kids will love."
Melanie C,Bangkok,Apr 2013,A great beach with shallow water. My son made friends with some local children and had a great time playing in the water and making sandcastles. Take a walk out to the water blow. - very cool! Take drinks and snacks as they can only be bought at the very expensive beachside restaurants. 
Maxon2511,"San Francisco, CA",Jul 2013,"We made an appointment for our photo session before noon a day before flying out of Bali.  If anybody would mention Bali.......beach comes to mind right away.  So, our intended location was the beach.  Veronika was our photographer.  She made us feel comfortable right from the start and she knew what she was doing.  It was a gamble on our part because it was our last day at Bali, if something goes wrong, there will be no way and no chance for a double take.  We started the photo shoot in the hotel property and the final setting was the (Nusa Dua) beach.  We posed, walked, ran, jumped, played role and some candid shots at the beach.  Our pants/shorts got wet by the waves but it turned out to be the highlight of the session.  The 6 pm scheduled preview was fun but overwhelming because we had to choose from the 354 shots taken.  Our preliminary number was 81 photos.  We were going to review the 81 photos to reduce it some more but then the male staff interrupted and offered us a deal....the first deal was not good enough and we refused....he sweetened the deal a bit more and we went off tip toeing our way to the restaurant for a special dinner.  Nice and friendly people to work with and they have a real good sense of humor.  The photos at the beach are the best ones!!!"
FrankBali47,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"visiting Nusa Dua you have several nice beaches to go.1/ Geger beach is a famous one with some small local restaurants on the spot.It is next to the HUGE and very luxury hotel Mulya hotel, that is claiming the beach in front of hotel as private. In my opinion ridicilious because guests of that hotel remain in garden and private pools. They have too many security to control the beach. But next to this hotel it is stll ""normal"" and often tourists come from Kuta or Jimbaran to see the Nusa Dua scenery.2/ Also you have pantai Mengiat (pantai means beach) next to Ayodia resort (before it was Hilton Bali) My favourite place for drink and food on the beach is this beach in Nusa Dua with the village (banjar) cooperation cafe/restaurant Warung Yasa Segara, the only one on the spot. You can sit/lay on the beach or sit on the lawn under a tree in front of the restaurant or under the roof enjoying drinks or reasonable price/quality food (but they can improve...!!)."
Vatsal S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2013,Clean and not too mnay hawkers. Beach in nearby Benoa can be dirty. Not windy unlike a other places in Nusa Dua as sheltered.
Lovers665,"Sydney, Australia",May 2013,"Beach was clean and almost deserted, beach dinners were great, band entertainment was excellent every time."
verasiagian,jakarta,Jul 2013,I love it since it is very quite and beautiful. The beach is white shandy beach even though is not as white as dreamland beach.
Suddu85,"New York City, NY",Jul 2013,"Very clean and neat beach. There is low tide on most afternoons, during which the water level recedes considerably and beach becomes rocky. Visit early mornings or late evening for a great experience."
Chaluqs,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2012,"What I like: Clean, pristine water. The sands are crystal white. Beach is not open to public, which means only hotel stayers are on the beach which makes it great and quietWhat I dislike: I am those type who likes to play with waves. The water at nusa dua is extremely calm. It is not fun"
Erwin K,"Bandung,Indonesia",Jun 2013,"Long stretch of the Nusa Dua beach privately owned by the hotels, such as Melia Bali,the Lagoon resort,the Westin etc.On the northern side of Nusa Dua beach,near the tip of Tanjung Benoa,was heaven for watersport enthusiast.Can do parasailing,banana boat,jet ski"
Lorrisydney H,"Cherrybrook, Australia",Jul 2013,"I love this beach as it is very calm water and suitable for non swimmers and swimmers alike - it is in a bay and really lovely.  At low tide, the water goes out and you can then wander around the sandy little pools looking at various things that are left - like little crabs etc."
roshwini,"Malacca City, Melaka, Malaysia",Jul 2013,"its alright if you just come for the view and to stroll along the beach, but for swimming, it is so-so. I have definitely seen better, even krabi and koh phi phi were heaps better. There was a problem with rubbish and litter could be seen at some stretches of the beach. Quite disgusting. At some parts, this was after we entered grand hyatt's compound illegally, we saw bottle caps and plastic food wrappers and whatnot floating around in the water. However, some parts of the beach is nice and had clear waters. definitely, much better than Kuta beach though"
Acsgcs,"Narbethong, Australia",Jul 2013,"The southern beach is better than the northern but both have a lot of litterNorthern beach has water sports, southern has nothing except water - much more peaceful and great walking.Northern has a lot more things include market people, hawkers, etcMore exciting but busy. Better paths too."
Farizan25,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2013,"The beach is just good enough for a stroll and a quick swim.  It is a good idea if you want to get away from crowded Kuta Beach and come to Nusa Dua for the beach.  Worthwhile and stunning, especially for couples."
ExPat0331,"Arlington, VA",Jul 2013,"Good beach, but was just not impressed.  Hawaii and Bermuda have better beaches.  Nusa Dua is more shallow....like not even thigh deep.  It served it's purpose, but it's more hype than anything else."
Aaron F,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jun 2013,"We took a taxi ride from Legian to here to get away from the over-crowded Kuta Beach. We weren't disappointed at all. The beach (Geger Beach) is stunning. It stretches on for (guessing) 5km. If I'm being picky, the sand is difficult to walk on and the sea isn't good to swim in. The waves are extremely strong. Not suitable for young toddlers. However, we found a spot on the Novotel sun beds and stayed there all afternoon. Very beautiful beach and was thoroughly impressed. So much better than Kuta. If I'm not mistaken, you can see the Uluwatu Temple on the edge of the cliff by the Mulia Hotel. A must if you would like a private, relaxing afternoon/stay away from the madness of Kuta."
Miley02,Philippines,Jun 2013,You you've been to the white sand beaches you will be disappointed here.  The sand is light brown and the the beach gets deep right away.
chackoka,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Jun 2013,"Calm, shallow, uncrowded beach with lots of facilities for water sports. The beach is clean and uncluttered."
Holidaymaker753,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2013,"Lovely Clean beach.  Hawkers are restricted on the beach, they can only come onto beach for 1 hour .  Each hawker has a licence number that gives them a certain time to go onto beach. This was fantastic as you were no constantly pestered while getting a  lovely tan. "
jure n,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Jun 2013,"From the outside the beach looks amazing, but underwater there is just sea grass. Keep in mind the tide, because when the sea gets back away from the beach you can't swim there."
Sa H,Gravesend,Jul 2012,"lovely clean beach and water, plenty of shade if required and lots of fish to swim with close by.  Perfect for relaxing."
putri d,bandung,Jun 2013,If you come with your coupel..this great place for take a picture or private beach just you and your coupel.
Clive F,"Ashby, Australia",Jun 2013,The Beach to the left hand side of the Conrad was really poor . It really needs to be cleaned up.If you walked right and managed to climb all the sand that has been dumped on the footpath by the building site .Shame on you Holiday Inn .The Beaches are not bad at all . 
chetnahira,India,May 2013,The beach near Denpasar was better though cleanliness obviously has be applauded and Turtle Island gives all water sports activity
Xena1982,"Beit Mery, Lebanon",Aug 2012,"When we went there last year in August 2012, the beach is nice, quiet and relaxing. The breeze of wind is nice and soothing. the sand is clean but the water needs a little bit of cleaning from all the Algae which is a bit disturbing to me. The sellers hold their distance from the tourists but they could be a bit annoying sometimes. Anyway it was nice lounging there and enjoying the beach of our Hotel which is walking distance from where we were staying."
D3sm0nd_L0w,"Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia",May 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is a more quiet beach compared to the bustling Legian beach. The main stretch of the beach is dominated by hotels, therefore hotel residents are most of the visitors of this particular beach. Unlike Legian beach which you have food stalls along the beach, this beach is full with sunbath coaches - so a splendid location for a quiet afternoon reading. There are plenty of locations under the shade too if one is not a fan of sunbath.The waves were strong during my visit in May."
Rain_maple,3 contributions,Apr 2013,What a beautiful to walk down! I wish I could stay whole day there without thinking busy life! Very quiet with blue sky and wind.. Wonderful ! 
mleigh32,"Laguna Niguel, CA",Jun 2012,"The kelp farmers were the best part of Nusa Dua - something we would never see in US. They are hard working, friendly and keep the beach immaculate."
Deden Setiawan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2013,Nice & Clean Beach. You have to rent a car or bicycle to get there or you have to booked hotel around nusa dua area but it's not cheap.
Sumbul T,"Bengaluru, India",May 2013,If you have the time this is the beach to laze around all day in. There is a water blow near it which is truly amazing.
JasonL4,"Brighton, UK",May 2013,"Great walk along the coast also past the other hotels. View at sunrise is stunning. Likewise, watching the clouds forming in the late afternoon on the horizon is impressive."
Graham G,"Canberra, Australia",Jun 2012,The Ayodya Hotel has a provate beach with security and a nearby salt water pool if you don't want to go in the sea.  Very clean and a lovely spot to just hang out.  Some did - all day!
Julie J,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2013,"We could jump in the water & not worry about our things, though we were there ourselves, its a great beach for little ones "
Jayson C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2013,"went for watersport, pretty pricey for a basic stuffs. becarefull not to get cheated there! there are alot of spots and they will accept USD too."
Sally-anne K,"Canberra, Australia",Apr 2013,"It really was very lovely and clean and well kept.  Sadly I have been spoilt in the Maldives and will not swim in anything not completely clear, turquiose and sparkly!  "
Jody M,Australia,May 2013,"So quiet, so pretty.... a coconut drink under the umbrella, no hassling from hawkers...bliss.  The restaurant on the beach delivered food to us so we didn't have to move..more bliss. So add the cheap meal and it was a lovely experience"
Doesjka,"Hamilton, New",Apr 2013,"The beach outside the resort (we stayed at The Westin) was stunning and very well groomed.  There is a reasonable amount of seaweed and rubbish (namely plastic bags) that float in the water from beaches elsewhere.The sand is beautiful, water temperature amazing in April, however we did get a couple of little stings (didn't last for long) but it was enough to send us back to the pool.We walked around the bay further (south side) which is where the locals hang out and the beach is absolutely littered with plastic bottles and bags.  Not so nice but important to see how the locals live versus the tourists."
GunturDewandaruputra,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Jun 2012,"nice , and is very good . play with japanese girl on the beach,liked to do with what's there. work as a guide in jakarta and bali meets japan girl I really like it and I started to fall in love on the beach Bali, Nusa Dua"
amylouise439,"sydney, australia",Apr 2013,"The beach is beautiful for Bali. Sitting on the beach outside our resort the Westin was lovely. The sand, for Bali, was clean and soft. We found swimming better (obviously) during high tide however there was still rubbish that was swept in which formed a barrier to get through prior to getting to clear swimming water (gross).  Low tide provided the best viewing and gave the hotel staff time to clear the rubbish that had accumulated. Nice to walk along at sunset however the wet sand does not harden like Australian beaches, and instead each step lands you ankle and sometimes shin high in sand and water."
JeanKlang,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2013,"Brilliant , we had a very good time in Melia Bali and the beach was in perfect condition during night and during day"
Frankandnida,"Emerald, Australia",Apr 2013,"Nice to have private beach for each hotel along the beach,the beach are clean and good for relaxing."
Kira C,Singapore,Apr 2013,"I have been to nicer beaches like in Phuket, Tioman Island, Perth, Miami etc. Bali is nowhere near the same standards.The water isn't clear. The beach isn't fantastic. I wonder why is it called a beach resort. There are a lot of con men there as well. The car rentals with drivers are rip off. The drivers quote you exorbitant prices and take you for a ride to expensive restaurants (further rip off) and lousy souvenir shops. It is a disappointment and I wouldn't be going back unless it is a free trip."
Lamboswede,California,Apr 2013,The beach is good but the sand is a bit dark for my taste. I prefer that really white sand so you get that green clear water.
HeatherAustralia,Australia,Apr 2013,Beach Club Novotel is on Nusa Dua beach and I found this a great place to relax and enjoy the sea breeze.  I was fortunate to try a beach massage whilst visiting.   Absolutely bliss for only 100.000 Rupiah ($10)
kristinahollie,"Minneapolis, MN",Nov 2012,Great waves and beach down by the Hyatt.  Not so great up by the Hilton.  Less surf and less dramatic low tide.  
Marney B,"Townsville, Australia",Apr 2013,I went here for the watersports.  I think they were over priced and the place was too busy.  Plus we couldn't do half of the sports on the day (e.g. Parasailing)
sue c,"Grimsby, UK",Nov 2012,"clean white sand, still waters, low tide can walk right out to reef. little issue with seaweed washing up but hotel constantly clear it"
JUN X,"Shanghai, China",Apr 2013,"beautiful beach with nice view,quiet and clean.I saw the beautiful sunrise.the kid likes the beach very much."
Arth06,"Milan, Italy",Aug 2012,"The beach isnt that clean and the waves at this end arent that high. More a spot for water-sports - para sailing, speed boat riding etc. The beach is lined with different stalls for water sports, and the moment you arrive you are surrounded by there representatives to get you to sign up with them.   One should take a look at a few of these stalls and then decide. The water sports seem to be decently priced but the time allotted to you is pretty short."
johnberndt,"New York City, NY",Nov 2012,"This is a peaceful beach cove amongst all the big wave surfer beaches in Bali. You can laze the day away here in this tranquil setting. The beautiful wide white sandy beach is very swimmable, good for children and adults. Not crowded with hawkers, policed and secure. Nice walking path past all the resorts."
ramjets5,Brisbane,Apr 2013,"We went out on a glass bottom boat to the reef. There is some live reef, but the water is murky and viewing very limited and fish life disappointing. The beaches are covered in litter at low tide. Next time ill just spend more time by the pool at the villa!"
fatma n,makassar,Apr 2013,"i stayed at Nusa Dua Beach with my little family for a short vacation in April 2013. I love the Bali's atmosphere in this hotel, its real happening. my spacious enough room at left wing ( I forget the wing""s name) of the hotel makes me can see the part of nusa dua white sandy beach and trees with many playing squirrels just in front of my room's terrace. for those who wants to enjoy sunbathing without disturbed by too many common tourist from other place, this hotel is highly recomended. I really enjoy the private beach in this hotel, its so different with Kuta or Dreamland that become so crowded at weekend. wanna enjoy the holiday on beach ?? Nusa Dua Hotel is the right place.."
shaan j,"Southall, UK",May 2012,This beach is quite shallow so ideal if you have small kids who like to paddle although a bit irritating for adults who want to swim as you have to wade out half a mile till you drop straight into the ocean if you want to snorkel.
Luvshiraz,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2013,Beach cleaned daily by hotel staff - lovely!  Huge surf - Watch undertow.  Wonderful for morning beach walks and evening star-gazing.
Brizzle11,"Bristol, UK",Apr 2013,Beautiful beach but has lots of rubbish when the tide is out. Just needs to be cleaned up ore often. Great rock pools when the tide is out!
kye4124,"Wanneroo, Australia",Apr 2013,"We went on the banana boat & the flying fish. Banana boat was very tame but the flying fish was excellent! Gets you airborne behind a speedboat, great fun for only $20. Heaps of other water sports here, parasailing, snorkelling etc. suggest you spend at least half a day so you can try them, beach itself was not very nice, but your not here for swimming."
MDontherun,"Ottawa, Canada",Apr 2013,Long stretch of beach that can be walked and explored. Lots of vendors but they generally leave you along unless you show interest. When the tide is high the water is quite nice. 
AzharJohar,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2013,Beach has nice waves and clean water. Beach is very near to the hotel and the swimming pool. Cabana rentals are also provided. Beach chairs are plenty. 
125Annie,"Tampico, Mexico",Dec 2012,"A great beach to walk around, think, relax and just be submerged in the ocean sounds and atmosphere.."
Klak2009,"Houston, TX",Oct 2012,"Very Calm beach! Great view! Nice for a walk, swimming or just relaxing under the sun (or at the Kiosks)"
falala_farahain,Singapore,Apr 2013,"Nothing much offered here. Signed up for water sports package which cost about US$28 consisting of parasailing, jetski and banana boat. They rushed you to do the activities and then done. Intended to relax but was disappointed at the mad rush through the activities. Not worth it. Dont bother unless you have never seen a beach. "
Balihotels,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"really nice Beachfront hotels, i loves gated area, nice sand and able to walk quite a ways. It's worth a trip if you want to swim at a nice sand beach"
Payoh,Singapore,Mar 2013,The water is not crystal clear clean and a lot of broken sea shell along the beach not world class. but good view for sunraise.
Fastphilad,Mich,Mar 2013,"Granted, Nusa Dua, is not representative of everyday life in Bali, but it may be the Bali you think of if it's going to be your first trip or for a short time.  In a gated area, nice sand and able to walk quite a ways.  It's worth a trip if you want to swim at a nice sand beach"
Anthony D,"Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia",Mar 2013,was good sand where we stayed. Pleasant surroundings. great little bay but swim no further than the buoys
ErikaQLD,"Queensland, Australia",Mar 2013,We enjoyed the Beach.  It was clean and pleasant.  The Restaurant Club 2.28 has a great Menu and Theme Nights.
Jill4920,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2013,"Nice sand,warm water,not overly crowded,Most resorts provide sun  lounges ,umbrellas ,cabanas,drink waiters.Locals were selling wares on beach but were not intrusive."
Boris G,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2013,"Nice sand, comfortable sunbeds, good service and very warm water. Unfortunately it is impossible to swim in the ocean when it is low tide, e. e. at least a half of the day."
The50s,"Mortdale, Australia",Mar 2013,Calm waters and warm... We only swam in the Conrad beach compound... It was clean and we had towel and water service.
Bearhug1,"Toronto, Canada",Mar 2013,clean and not crowed!  beautiful for long walks- highly recommend if you are looking for peace and quiet!
Sotiris11,"Agios Stefanos, Greece",Aug 2012,"Look. I'm Greek and I have swimmed in, most possibly, some of the best seas and beaches in the world. Having said that, I think that the Nusa Dua beach is below average. You almost can't swim because of the large waves which try to get you out of the sea. Signs on the beach warn you of dangerous sea animals. And during the daily tide in the afternoon you can see all garbage that other tourists have thrown in the sea in the recent past. Apart from all that, you can lie on a bed, get a sun tan and enjoy the view - not during the tide, of course."
percyvakil,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2012,"Compared to some of the other beaches in Bali, Nusa Dua Beach is relatively quiet. Nusa means island, and Dua means two, which is how the beach got it's name. There are two little islands where sand has now settled to form the beach.Part of the beach is occupied by a row of luxury hotels, part open, used for watersports of many kinds."
rudy s,"San Jose, Costa Rica",Feb 2013,You have to go....the sand and view is great... fantastic for a romantic walk on the beach.....Feb could be very windy so check the weather forecast 
wanderlust0055,New York,Mar 2013,"we stayed near kuta beach but didnt like it much as its very commercialized. thanks to our driver, we decided to go to nusa dua beach and kid you not, it was one of the best beaches ive been too. the water was clear and green-blue in colour. people just laid back or swam in the sea. noone bothered us with water sports activities. a private getaway especially for couples!!"
Helena M,"Espoo, Finland",Feb 2013,"Long beach, seagrass during lowtide. There are some snorkeling sites a bit further but boat drivers will take you there for 200 IDR (~25 EUR)."
Eunice_Lau,Malaysia,Feb 2013,"Nusa Dua beach is awesome. There have a lot of water spot there like (snorkeling,banana boat,flying fish,jet ski,glass bottom boat,diving,turtle island and etc). You can purchase a ticket to turtle island but it is quite expensive. The ticket costs IDR 250,000/person and there is nothing to see at turtle island. Just a few turtles in the ponds, an eagle, a snake, a chameleon, two hornbills, few bats and birds there. However, you can drive to Nusa Dua Water Blow area (no need entrance fee), the view is amazing. It is a nice place to take photos and enjoy the sea breeze."
pnMazzy,malaysia,Mar 2013,"In overall, the beach at Nusa Dua is cleaner and calmer than in Kuta. However there are not much different between those in terms of scenery and commercial activity. Sport activities seller are everywhere and aggressively approaching for business, which really spoil the mood and the atmosphere. Balinese government should really work harder in the public infrastructures, especially waste management system for cleaner beach."
shellyy185,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Beach was so beautiful. The sands looks like pearl, and is very suitable for surfing. Large beach area, peacefull. Not so far from Tanjung Benoa."
Donna P,"West Hollywood, CA",Mar 2013,this beach is just so beautiful and after spending many mornings walking up the beach path i must say the people you meet are so lovely and the staff of others resorts always quick to say slamat pagi love it..
ms_ayu96,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2012,"Nusa dua beach located in the lower east bali island. It has more calm wave, but if you like to play in the sea ; just a couple block north you will find tanjung benoa which is famous for its water activity.I prefer this spot because is way less crowdy than kuta beach, this one is also cleaner and also packed with 5 stars hotels.Really good place to have your morning stroll or even have your night running."
mark r,"Fremantle, Australia",Feb 2013,"our first visit to Nusa Dua Bali,stay in Nusa Dua hotel,,just walk around Nusa Dua Garden and do some shoping,was wanderfulsecond day explore to nusa dua beach just for couple of hours that was very nice ,we spend more time in Nusa Dua beach coz really nice,after firs visit to the beach we need to come back more time,that same like must to visit,,our kid love this beachthanks marck"
kittentravels,"Saint Kilda, Victoria, Australia",Jan 2013,"Really touristy beach, visit if you like beaches and don't have anything else to do- yet I feel that there is a lot more culture and colour to see in Bali than at just another beach. Quite a big surf spot. "
Merothehero,"Calgary, Canada",May 2012,"But watch out for the tide... it takes water waaaaaaaaaaay off the shore! :) We went in May, and the water was still not warm enough for a swim :)"
johnbudi77,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"The beach is clean with a white sand beach. Not very large wave, suitable for children to swim on the beach."
Intan R.,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Jan 2013,"It was okay. But those who like water activities, this is definitely your place. You can also go to turtle island from here. "
Yardan,Kalkan,Feb 2013,"Beach is nice but there is to much jetski. so you can't go to far. You can't see to much fish or underwater world close to beach. You need to take a boat and tell them so they will take you coral and fish area, which is much better."
Lena G,"Shanghai, China",Feb 2013,Very nice beach but not a nice place for swimming. It would be fantastic to stay in the spa houses on the beach and reading a book. But the beach itself is a little bit disappoint as the sands are rough and hurting and the sea water is not as clean as in OZ.
Pranav S,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Mar 2012,"I loved this beach. It was so nice & clean, plus so many outlets for water sports (we tried everything except the sea-walker. diving was a bit boring )You can have a nice walk, & eat at the shacks of hotels or independent ones. We tried a few, non were bad.the water is so clear that you can see the bottom for a few feet."
h_viii,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2013,"Good for families as clean and no-one hassling you (as compared to Kuta beach). You can use the beach chairs and shade and the wate was very calm, so safe for the kids"
Beccc,34 contributions,Jan 2013,Great beach. We stayed at the Grand Hyatt and this section of the beach was well cared for by the Grand Hyatt. Sand was raked daily. Lots of chairs and even some Bali huts to laze in by the water.
GemiAgung,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"the beach was nice, quite, not as crowed as kuta beach. a lot of 5 stars hotel located at this beach.  "
IndiaUKdoc,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2013,"This beach in Nusa Dua is great and beautiful. There is a shower and half decent toilets. Use the cafe if beach chairs too steep, they do not mind as long as you keep sipping the arak based cocktail"
travelbunny0306,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2013,"The beach is clean and calm. Very suitable for kids. My little boy whom is 1, enjoyed the beach so much that he refuses to the leave the beach when we wanted to have a rest in the room!"
Ian H,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2013,Nice strip of beautiful hotels but the water is a little cloudy.lovely path along the seaside with beautiful trees and palms
Annehurdyhamadiddle,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2013,Each day beach is raked and any seaweed removed. Not crowded with sellers. Great walking path along the beach.
A_Visitor_2010,"Bangkok, Thailand",Feb 2012,"Beach is just average or below it and perhaps overrated. Your hotel may be on the beach, but that may not add much value to it."
Muhammad B,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2012,"A very nice beach, completely swimmable and perfect temperature. The other beaches in Bali are nowhere near as nice.Not the greatest beach on the planet but certainly the nicest beach on Bali"
Kristi_Turner,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2012,"The sand and beach at Nusa Dua are really good.  The water is refreshing.  You can walk up the beach and snorkel out on the reef and let the current take you back to where you started.  It's definitely not the great barrier reef, but is still a good beach.  They have other activities such as catermarans, windsurfing and kayaking"
Hannah,"Washington DC, DC",Jun 2012,a little annoying that people try to sell you crap you don't want but it's a gorgeous bali white sand beach!
MelReed23,"Seaford, South Australia, Australia",Dec 2012,"My sister and I did the jet skiing here, was awesome fun! Both went on the same jet ski together so got to drive it. I've done parasailing here before as well back in 2008 which was wicked fun - wanted to do it again but the wind was going the wrong way. Beautiful place."
COPINF,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2012,Nusa Dua Municipality must start to clean its beaches as well as sea to make it more crystall-clear to attract more colorfull fishes to swim between.
Shawn B,"Tampa, FL",Dec 2012,"Great white sand and a classic beach look.  However, there is no real marine life in the water, making it very stale to those who enjoy seeing fish"
asien_as,"Labuan Bajo, Indonesia",Dec 2012,"When you visit Nusa dua beach, there are some point i need to mention: you may need to visit the Water Blow, taking picture with the Giant Statue of Rama, Go to the Left side and walk through some wild plants and you will arrived at a cliff side and the view were amazingly Beautiful... you can see water, sky, beach, forest and seems smaller Rama Statue there."
Oliver S,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2013,"Areas clened by hotels such as the Conrad, Grand Hyatt and St Regis are great. There is still a lot of trash in the water though."
Kenneth O,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2012,If it like peace and quiet thesis the place not crowded like kuta . We just chill. Out and sat on the bench and just listen to the waves sound splashing and the sand was just nice not too coarse nor too powdery 
ManFromMinneapolis,"Minneapolis, MN",Oct 2012,"Good news is there are no surfers or their personalities or their families.  Bad news is there are absolutely no waves at all...  Great for snorkling or chilling by the beach, bad if you want to ride the waves...  If you stay at the right resort, you wont regret it..."
BK_TheTraveller,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2012,"Just kved this beach the most, very nice, very clean serene and yet private. One of the places where most activities happen.... The water sports and the fun begins here..."
Dr_Miami,"London, UK",Oct 2012,I stayed away from this beach as it was very dirty - full of motorised fishing and recreational boats.
Suzanne6304,Wales,Jul 2012,"This is probably the nicest beach on Bali, it is a beautiful cove, the tides rise and fall dramatically allowing you excellent swimming when the tide is in and fascinating beachcombing when the tide is out, always wear a beach sandal as the whole area is teeming with anenomes. It is fascinatinating to watch the local fishermen carry out their trade. The only annoying thing is the beach vendors, but if you are firm they will leave you alone. Only pay about a third of what they ask for always haggle them down."
jachelletraveler,singapore,Dec 2012,"we took the package of snorkelling , jetski and turtle island. snorkelling was average with free underwater camera thrown in gratis . I think Tioman is better. the waters are not crystal clear but fishes are there. Turtle island was fun for the kids - lots of animals at close proximity for photographs. Nice and friendly guides.Jetskis are new and fun but the 15 miniutes promised turned out to be 11 minutes. complained to the timekeeper but just got waved off. there is shower after the whole affair . overall goodretrospectively , should have bargained for a lower price or more activities thrown in. Our driver reminded us but we forgot"
hharrison1997,"Marcoola, Australia",Dec 2012,Great place to spend a few hours or a whole day. Water very clean and safe and sand clean and white. 
Angela40,"Springfield, Australia",May 2012,"Beach outside resort was OK, was dirty if you ventured beyond resort boundaries.  Water was not very inviting."
Jo Beth,"Noosa, Australia",Dec 2012,"After travelling to Bali 10 times before, I decided to stay at the Laguna Hotel Nusa Dua.The beach was the best Ive seen so far in Bali and the Laguna was an amazing hotel. Great facilities, staff were so friendly and helpful and the food was delicious!. Would go back there anyday. Highly recommended."
Chris G,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2012,Great place to relax and watch the world go by.  No haggling from the usual Kuta sellers of wares.  Great place to enjoy water sports or just lay back and drink a cold Bintang.
AngeloHD,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2012,"Great clean water, great sunbeds and service from the resorts. Staff always ready to help and take your order"
YH_Poh,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2012,The beach is very relaxing in the early evening. One can choose to order a nice drink and relax on a lounge chair or have a nice stroll with yr love ones
BartCrowther,"Cronulla, Australia",Oct 2012,"Nice and clean at the resort, Bali Tropic seemed to have the largest beach compared to most resorts in Nusa Dua"
KerryYumYum,"Norwich, UK",Dec 2012,Just beautiful! We went to Nusa Dua to visit friends staying at the Melia Bali. Hotel and beach were wonderful
Tessa S,"Coolangatta, Australia",Nov 2012,We love the beach here but we got hassled to buy things so I was hard to just relax otherwise it was gorgeous.
alannah2010,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2012,"Plenty of beach lounges available however the beach had a lot of sea weed which I do not like -so ""paddled ""only and used the sea water pool at the resort"
Maureen F,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2012,"Lovely clean beach, never crowded, with good walking pathway to other hotels and blow-hole.  Looks particularly good at evening time."
Lina Jasin,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2012,"Sometimes the vendor will offer us Sarong or Massage, kind of disturb our reaxing time at the beach, but if do not get those disturb, its really nice and relax to lay down or take a nap"
Giovanna C,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2012,"poor beach with dirty sea. In the morning, when we got up, there was a sea weed's carpet 200 mt. deep."
Jessica_guy,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2011,It is a private beach for no hawkers (well not many) and the water is beautiful and they have plenty of water sports all along the beach.
DavidSef,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2012,"This is a really beautiful beach with white sand and clear water. Everything you see in a postcard but the banks of seaweed kind of kill the ambiance. It's very shallow and you can walk out for perhaps 2km but the entire way is blocked by banks of seaweed. i think they're trying to clean it up though, at least that's what I think I saw them doing there."
BeaAkhtar,"Manchester, UK",Oct 2012,lovely clean beach white sand and clean water bars close by and staff ready to help you move your loungers at your request 
scb813,"Pittsburgh, PA",Oct 2012,"The hotels here are great and the beach itself has some beautiful views.  The sand, however, is just OK.  It's pretty gritty and not super clean.  The water is a little cool."
yolandatomasoa,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2012,"Nice view with yummi food.. We love it.. Especially my baby girl.. She loves it very much.Clean beach, great facility and the most important it's free.. What else do you expect..Spend our time almost 2 hours and we never get bored."
willgrace,lincolnshire,Sep 2012,"there are a lot of beach sellers on this beach they are licensed and you only need to say no politely and they move on, to be replaced by another one."
Sue T,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2012,Beautiful Beach clean a world class beach and safe to paddle.The full moon was out on our last night and amazing sight seeing the moon reflecting over the ocean.
macrossworks,Kuala Lumpur,Aug 2012,"It was a great beach, there is a shopping centre called discovery shopping centre. Plenty of tourists and is only less than 15mins from most of the hotels around Nusa Dua. Great sunset view from the shopping centre itself."
airicCH,"Ottawa, Canada",Sep 2012,We recommend swimming in the afternoon (during low tide). It's easier to swim and see the fish in the water. During high tide (morning) it is extremely difficult to swim against the current!
UkJaffa,"Castleford, UK",Aug 2012,"beach was too shingley, and quite a lot of reef,but beach sellars nice and polite they didn,t hassle you too much"
Swe-Nor-traveler,Hong Kong,Sep 2012,"To crowded and not as clean as other places in Bali. It is a place to come to for entertainment, but I would stay away from picking this place for my hotel. "
Rica R,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Aug 2012,"This has been my favorite beach to swim. The turquoise and clean and clear water like no other. It is good to swim at the afternoon. The waves is friendly and it is not too deep. The water is also so clear. It is also recommended for beginner surfers. If you are a beach lover, you should go to Mengiat beach."
culik333,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2012,the sand is white and very nice to take a sun-bathe on; sea is clean and clear and it's nice to swim under the sun; 
zinasj,"Seattle, WA",Aug 2012,Visited this beach because it was near our hotel. Nothing special. Stray dogs around this area. It seemed dirty. We didn't go into water.The view at Jimbaran is better.
Max M,"Milan, Italy",Aug 2012,"Really nice and quite beach, the sea is clean and there are not so many people you can find also some good place for eat "
Boy-Nellie,"Oss, The Netherlands",Jul 2012,"Along the beach there is a walking area of 5 km from Tanjun Benoa to Nusa Dua. We watched the waterblow, very high waves splashing on the rocks."
Ryan C C,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2012,"The watersports made the water oily and a bit dirty, but there were not many pushy 'salespeople' around to mar the tranquility."
Sina149,Dubai,Aug 2012,"The Beach is wonderfully nice and calming, you can walk your way through the beach and access to many hotels and resorts... It is perfect for getting a Tan or laying to relax!"
Guido B,Belgium,Aug 2012,"Nusa Dua Beach is a nice sandy beach for little feet to play in. Very shallow water and as it is protected by a reef, there is no surf or wave to endanger the little tikes either. Not many hawkers and hecklers either and at the stretch behind the Melia you have a couple of local food stalls which close at around seven(ish)"
HolidaysAllOver,Melbourne,Aug 2012,Lovely tidal beach.  Great for watersports when tide was in and the kids enjoyed hunting for crabs when tide was out.  Nice clean water.
yummy_factor,las vegas,Aug 2012,"The beach itself is pretty and clean and there aren't very many people hassling you during the day. If a guy named Nyoman offers you a coconut, TAKE IT!! he brought simple syrup, sliced limes, and ice and it was the best!"
Patricia A,United State,Jul 2012,"There are high tide differences in Bali, when the tide is out the beach is pretty ordinary. I was extremely surprised at the amount of garbage floating in the water. I spent one day at the beach and it was enough"
sunny197251,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2011,Beach was very  dirty & smelly  Beach water was Full of sea urchin . Many local people came  to the beach and burn the paper  & send paper to the sea I think that makes   ruin the sea   & beach And it was very noisy with  local music all day I really can not have peace of mind . View was not that great and no wind ... ... Extremely hot every day . Seriously you can find better beach in  Malaysia . No need to fly so far way I have no fantasy with bali . Very regret to came  here .
snah55,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2012,"The view here is breathtaking and the waters are clean. Waves can be strong and choppy though. There is water sports available here, such as para sailing."
WIlson_HK_12,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2012,The beach is clean and quiet. Secured by guards. Sand is pure white. But wave may be too big for swimming.
Jason-ASDF,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2012,"Good place to escape the otherwise chaotic island. Each resort has their own little area where they serve food and drinks, it is good quality but quite expensive for the island."
saverioca,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2012,We lost Nusa due beach because we lost the balinese atmosphere  behind the cement of the Jakarta enterprises . we lost the original dry environment 
Aggie M,Perth,Apr 2012,"We came out of curiosity as we were in the area. Our driver took us to the beach and there was a memorial garden which we walked to. The beach was rather clean and not bad considering it was open to the public. There were massage stalls and paths. The water seemed calm. I think it is a nice one to go swimming with young kids. We just walked around and then left as we were heading to Uluwatu. The area was distinctly catered to tourists and what seemed like 5-6 star hotels. The security was tighter, etc. and certain sections of the beach were closed off to the public. That quick stopover gave us a sense of what it would be like to stay in Nusa Dua, compared to Kuta/Legian."
travelwithkids2012,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Jun 2012,"The beach was golden sand but littered with seaweeds and trash. The coral was only yards from shore. We saw some life in the tide pools when the tide was out. There was hardly any wave but it's not suitable for swimming either as there was jelly fish in the water. Maybe good for sun-bathing or children to play on the beach. It is very quiet, compared to the more popular Kuta Beach."
tsfoxen,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2012,"I am probably spoiled after experiencing Thailand's paradise beaches but Nusa Dua is not anything special, at least not in front of the Conrad."
ProudlyDurbs,"Westville, South Africa",Jul 2012,The beach in front of the Grand Hyatt is not so good. By 11am the water recedes to a distance and the coral really hurt one's feet. A 20/30 minute walk to the beach on the right of the hotel provided a good swimming area. One has to find a beach that can be enjoyed for swimming!
dianeyorkshire,yorkshire,Aug 2011,Not as nice as I had hoped but the lacuna hotel lagoons more than make up for that. We also saw quite a few rats on the beach wich put us off but nothing in the hotel grounds
familyfuninsun,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2012,"Beach sand course and no surf, felt like an inner city beach"
Laujemsar,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2012,"Nice and clean, better than expected, didnt get hassled."
FayLim,37 contributions,Aug 2011,"Wonderful and amazing place to visit. It has a very beautiful beach, white sand, clean environment and was surronded by 5 stars luxury hotels. Nusa Dua Beach is not in my itinerary, but our driver brought us there. Thanks and appreciate to him, MR.Agung. We are surprised with the awesome ""waterblow"", the blue lagoon and the special geoographic area.Strongly recommend it as a must visit place. It is FOC to enter the beach and waterblow area eventhough you may not affordable to staying over there."
Branislav B,"Bratislava, Slovakia",Feb 2012,"Nusa dua is the best ...clean water, white & clear sand, fantastic resorts."
raio0611,"Osaka, Japan",Jul 2012,"Really romantic the view of the setting sun(><)It is in a beach sandal by all means!As for the rice,sea foods are unrivaled articles"
Ripple S,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2012,Private beach with no waves though. But clear waters and emerald green seaweed. Perfect for sun tanning and lazing around.
Abdulaziz A,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2012,"I can say that it is a good beach, but not the best beach in Asia , I mean it can be sandy in some area but you face some rocks and underwater plants "
zcemp13,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2012,"Whitish sands, safe for kids when the tide goes out mid way, clear waters, able to just sit there in the sea with your partner and have a lovely conversation, it's generally very clean. "
Rob E,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2012,"Even the beach at St. Regis was littered with rubbish. Went for a swim and found the following just floating near shore: a diaper, clothes hanger, drinking straw, pen cap, bottle cap, teabag, potato chip bag. Bali is not good for swimming. It's simply too filthy, and I'd say unsafe especially for children. It's a shame because the water itself is nice enough. I still swam the following day because I can't resist jumping into warm ocean but I don't recommend it for anyone worried about  their health."
David E,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2012,"There are high tide differences in Bali, when the tide is out the beach is pretty ordinary.  Plenty of hotel pools for swimming though, not sure I would swim at the beach.  "
Ray_and_Amanda,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2012,"So beautiful, but we had watched Jaws the night before, so wimped out of having anything past a shallow paddle!"
Yves t,"Maastricht, The Netherlands",May 2012,"On both sides of Nusa Dua Beach hotel are hotels that offer much better value for money. Rooms really need to be renovated...Too bad they are not keeping up with Melia, Laguna, Westin or any other hotel located close to them."
silliv,manchester,Jan 2012,"Lovely area, nice walk along the coast, good bars, restaurants and cafes available on the front but mainly along the road. cafe and comfortable to walk in day and evening. Great relaxation and place away from the more commercial parts of Bali"
peteozi,Brisbane,Jun 2012,"The beach at Nusa Dua is varied depending where you stay. We recently stayed at the Club Bali Mirage where the beach was good when the tide was in but terrible when it was out. You could actually walk 200 meters out to sea it was so low.  However, the beach in front of the Ayodya Resort was much better and you could actually swim at low tide. The pictures of the beach on some resort sites leaves a lot to the imagination and does not represent what is really there. We generally prefer the pool to the ocean as the water can be cloudy and full of seaweed."
Pohim,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jan 2012,"It is a good beach to relax under the sun with a good book but definitely not for swimming. I find the water to be ""cloudy"" and the sand so coarse. Don't expect too much or else will be disappointed. "
danewtl,"Klang, Selangor, Malaysia",Jun 2012,"Visited twice in this trip. I don't really know the exact location of the beach but the 1st day our driver took us to what seems like all the top hotel area of Nusa Dua. At the end of the road, there is beach area for us to relax whilst waiting for our wives to finish their massage. Walking along the beach, I realised that despite all the beach chairs and facilities by the hotels, the beach is actually quite dirty. Seen load of rubbish floating along the waves onto the beach. There was a bar somewhere nearby and we had our Bintang Beer at 35,000 ruppiah per glass. Can't complain on the hotel pricing. The next day, we were taken to another side of Nusa Dua where we wanted to do the Sea Walker but on arrival was told that per pax cost us USD108. I understood from the internet it cost around USD55 so there was no way we were going for it. Instead, snorkeling cost only USD25 so in order to satisfy the boys, we agreed to take up snorkeling. We were taken to a boat which took us out further to sea. On the way, it was a long sad sight to see. Rubbish on the beach and floating on the sea. Dead sea corals underneath! Not so clear waters. Is this the Great Bali Beach we came for? When we jumped out of the boat for snorkeling, the waves were incredibly strong even for an adult, and the tide keep taking us away from the boat. I had to swim afloat just to keep an eye on the boys from straying away. The snorkeling activity was for an hour but after 20 mins, we all decided we had enough and jumped onto the boat. Surprisingly, there is no ladder and not easy climbing up by stepping on the motor engine. Along the way back, plenty of sea activity... jet skies, banana boat etc. How long will this beach last until the sea becomes undesirable one day? Well, there are plenty of good beach and sea for great underwater activities and this is certainly not one of them"
hippodiver,"Hong Kong, China",May 2012,Bali's beaches are certainly not the best in Asia.
dsiemion,"Jacksonville, FL",Jun 2012,The beach was a comfortable place to relax.  There was some light attempts to sell things but not too bad.  There are a lot of nice bars and lounges along the beach owned by the resorts.  The water was very shallow (ankle high) near the coast in a few locations but with a short walk you can get to a standard coastline for better water options if desired.
hmpbpd,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Jul 2011,"This beach is really just a little rock jetty - the only part of Nusa Dua not ""owned"" by the huge hotels. Not much to do there if you're not staying at one of the mega-resorts."
Yarmm,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2011,"Not too crowd like in kuta beach, more quiet, its a great place for relaxing"
Dreamtofly,"Innsbruck, Austria",Apr 2012,"I think its the most decent,clean and beautiful beach in Bali ....White sands with amazing view from Penida Island right across !!"
Harriet M,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",Dec 2011,i loved it. its great - no negatives - go for it!!!
3LittleBeachBums,26 contributions,Apr 2012,"Go to Bali for the culture, not the beach.  There are many more beautiful beaches in South East Asia.  Nusa Dua beach was nice though."
zeroeight,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2012,Nice stretch of sand.  Too bad it faces east so we could not get the sunsets over water.  Not busy like Jimbaran Bay.
Farah A,"Manama, Bahrain",Apr 2012,"In comparison to the other beach we've been to - Kuta / Legian Beach - this beach was quieter, cleaner, and the waves were calmer.Most of the beaches are owned by the hotels / resorts, however you can walk up and down the beaches.  If you want to get yourself a long chair to relax then you need to pay a small fee to use the chairs.  If you are only visiting the beach then I recommend you get your own towel as the resorts who rent out the chairs to visitors don't provide towels.Lots of variety in terms watersports - snorkeling, diving, sailing, windsurfing, a trip to an island to see turtles, etc."
Karen K,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2012,Most of the beaches at Nusa Dua are privately owned by the resorts.  You are however allowed to walk along the beach and we even used some of the resort lounge chairs when we wanted.  The beach itself is clean but very tidal.  
bamboobaby,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2012,I was extremely surprised at the amount of garbage floating in the water.  I spent one day at the beach and it was enough.  My next day was spent poolside.  
Tom N,Darwin,Apr 2012,Plenty of sun beds and very good service if required.
Sandy-WorldTraveler,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2012,"Please see my pictures, was blessed to have crystal clear waters, white sand and cloudless skies during our recent trip to Nusa Dua (March 30th, 2012). Pictures taken outside the Novotel. Pure bliss and much cleaner comparatively to Benoa (2nd to Nusa Dua), Kegian & Kuta."
Ian M,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2012,"Beach wasnt clean! Syringes found in front of us on Westin area of beach!  So many petrol watersports, there was a 'film' of fuel on the surface.  Wouldn't swim there!"
CanadaWorldtraveller,canada,Mar 2012,"Bali has very nice beaches, but if you've been to south pacific or carribean, you will find like me that the beaches ar not that spectacular. However, very clean and well maintainted. And its always pleasant to go to the beach!"
greenfrogBrisbane,Brisbane,Mar 2012,"At high tide the beach was great, at low tide not so great.  Warm water in March which was great.Being from Queensland, we have the best beaches in the world!!!"
rogermb,UK,Apr 2011,"The hotel facilities, pools etc are superb but the beach is really poor by comparison. "
Beach Bum B,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2012,"We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard and really enjoyed the days there. The beach that their shuttle took us to was flat, sandy and very quiet. There is some decent 3-4 foot surf just off the beach, but no waves make it into the shore. The vendors are not aggressive at all and present a good selection of things to consider."
crossbordertraveller,NSW,Mar 2012,"The feel here is very relaxed. Not for the surfers, but a refreshing place to cool off, near many great restaurants and local drink shops. People here are obviously on holidays and you'll mix with locals enjoying a cool off as well. Nice beach, it would rate, even in Australia."
Caprice164,347 contributions,Mar 2012,"a bit rough, the waters be careful on some days, these are the days you will probably use the pool as most did."
GJAJ,"Chicago, IL",Mar 2012,"For those of us who don't live near an ocean, we like to go to the ocean for waves.  They have built up walls to completely shut off all waves from this beach, especiall in front of the Conrad."
BigBuddy66,"Winchester, VA",Mar 2012,The beach is not as crowded as others and is protected somewhat from currents on the end where the Melia Hotel is.   Its only waist_deep for quite a ways out.  It's not the best beach I've been to but its not bad.  The view from the shore is beautiful though.   
Marlene002,"Inverness, UK",Mar 2012,beach was brilliant very clean and very relaxing.  The restaurant was good value for money.
Nandoshu,"Sao Paulo, SP",Dec 2011,"Beach near the Golf and Country Club and the Novotel Hotel is a open beach with current, you might have a day use, good drinks and decent food. A good option to stay in Nusa Dua and enjoy a different beach."
Simply Travel and Eat,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2012,"The better beaches in Bali as most of these beaches are maintained by the international resorts located along the beach.Clean and low waves beaches as the beach should be sheltered, as we see waves from a distance but never hit the shore. The sands are soft and white. Good for children."
travelqueen15,"Philadelphia, PA",Feb 2012,Not able to really enjoy because of rocks and seaweed.  But beautiful sand. 
erijon,East Aegean,Feb 2012,When I saw Nusa Dua beach I thought that it's the sight  someone must have in mind when talking about a beach in Bali... It compares with no other popular beach on the island for me.Not the best or what I had dreamt before going to the island but certainly a well looking place.
SirkKx,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2012,"Beautiful location, nice at sunset but a lot of trash"
cam_sydney4,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2011,"Beach had (typically asian) floating rubbish, but overall not a bad beach. It's protected by a reef and had quite a high tidal range."
Nancy544,"Sydney,Australia",Jan 2012,"We love the fact that you can walk along the beach and stop at different resorts for a drink, have a look at the stalls and generally just enjoy the ambiance.  The sand could be a problem if they don't keep it off the path - not good for bikes. "
Elaini K,"Nanaimo, Canada",Jan 2012,"the massage ladys are simple the best ever, they work in atent so even if theres aquick storm you are still being pampered"
Abroadin5inchheels,"Sydney, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2012,Loved the water sports.  Felt safe and lots of fun.
nicthechick5,"Bundaberg, Australia",Jan 2012,"Great for Jet skiing and swimming. Altough lots of seaweed on the shore, there are always beach cleaners clearing up. Pristine and picture perfect."
cocksy,"South Yarra, Australia",Sep 2011,"It was windy,sea was choppy(could have been the day).Sand was a bit dirty.....needed someone to clear the seaweed etc for tourists"
PatriciaZA,"Jhb, South Africa",Dec 2011,Far better than Kuta beach and other busier beaches
Zydre,"Anso, Spain",Jan 2012,Very nice especially near Laguna and Nusa Dua hotel and spa. Westin is ok as well.
Chee Beng C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2011,The grill fish is good and there is a nice sunset view.
Michael W,"Los Angeles, CA",Nov 2011,"This was a bit different than Kuta beach, and would say it's great for families that are looking to get away from all of the craziness that Bali has to offer. There are less merchants on the beach trying to sell you bracelets and generally a more relaxing experience."
Catherine H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2011,"We hunted down the Nusa Dua Beach Grill at Geger Beach (which is currently being dwarfed by the construction of the Melia resort) for lunch one day.  We were picked up from our hotel by the owner and enjoyed a lovely relaxed lunch.  After lunch, we were invited to make use of the beach/loungers belonging to the Beach Grill and we went directly down to what is a really pretty part of the beach and had a swim.  There were a few others there in the cove who had also discovered this secret location, but I'm sad to say that once the monolith of a resort next door is completed, I don't think that beach (or the Beach Grill) will be the same the next time we visit.  I'm so glad we got to visit now!"
Bernie G,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2011,There is a sidewalk that runs from Ayoyda along the beach. It crosses sevral properties which is interesting and is a nice stroll away from traffic. The beach is warm and for the most part safe. Watch the flags.  
SerendipLara,Lara,Nov 2011,It was great to swim in the refreshing water. The beach was graded and cleaned daily and there was always something to see. The fact that there was a beach bar did not influence me. I think I am kidding myself 
Perth_Marie,Perth,May 2011,"Went to Nusa Dua beach during my holiday in which i stayed at the Novotel Nusa Dua.  The hotel had a beach shuttle bus that took you past the golf course and on to the beach where it was private with beach loungers set out, a lovely looking restaurant and bar.Even though the shuttle bus was packed, once onto the beach it was very relaxing and peaceful.  The ocean here was flat and kids were swimming in it, the sand was white and fine (and clean).  looking to the other side of the private 'novotel' beach was the 'St Regis' beach - but no one seemed to be there."
hairycelt,"Worthing, UK",Nov 2011,"keep free of debris and rubbish, security kept hawkers at bay"
Leighgrange,"North Beach, Australia",Mar 2011,"I love crystal clear water and some waves - Nusa Dua beach is not that, but its clean and fine for a wade in the shallows."

Mumbo123,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2011,"Great beach for families as no surf, but lovely clean sand and clear water."
keentravelerEssex,"Leigh-on Sea, UK",Nov 2011,"the beach owned by our hotel is littered with plastic bags,empty satchets, toothpaste tubes,etc etcyou cannot swim without being caght up by these litter. The jet ski I was on had to stop as the blades was tangled ith plastic bag!!!shame  as the water is warm and  clear and the sand is beautiful."
Krittyc,melbourne,Oct 2011,"Because the beaches are tended to by private resorts they are combed and cleaned. There is a great open air massage place between Ayodya and the Hyatt resort grounds (near Ayodya watersports counter). Ask for Maria (numner 4), best full massage EVER!  "
Ian C,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2011,"With the tide,you cannot swim in the beach for long,and you have to pick the right time of day."
CDG115,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2011,"Not one of the prettiest beaches I've traveled too, the water had a lot of seaweed not too far out so the color wasn't great."
Ole L,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2011,"Not sure what the fuss is all about, packed with jet skis, man made boulders - not very pretty."

Claughton,"Dublin, Ireland",Nov 2011,One of the most beautiful we have ever been to. White sand (groomed daily oustide our hotel). Perfect for kids as its shallow all the way out to the edge of the reef. 
Sarah A,"London, UK",Jul 2011,The beach was large but rubbish was washed up in the mornings so it wasnt very attractive to swim in.
Peter B,"Kialla, Australia",Oct 2011,"This beach has plenty of shady trees, and the water has no surf,  is shallow and safe for toddlers. Only a few beach hawkers so you dont get hassled to much."
Morcella,"Santa Rosa, CA",Sep 2011,"We went on a glass bottom boat to snorkel.  From the hot air into the Indian Ocean it felt cold.  Then I adjusted and all was well.  The snorkeling was fine, but not the best.  Exciting non the less, hey you are in Bali.  Watching the parasailing was fun.  Just not for me, yet!"
teamcurlcurl,sydney,Oct 2011,Pretty and lively!  Not much to dislike.  Nice water temperature and clean.  Nice to stroll along the path and check out the other hotels on offer.
Manoj Poddar,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2011,"On teh beach near Grand hyatt, there were strong currents, a sudden gradient as u entered water which makes it dangerous. The beach was kind of  dirty although having ample scarce yellow sand and one staying as nusa dua as opposed to kuta-legion or seminyak often feel confined to hotel"
Melanie B,"Hillcrest, South Africa",Sep 2011,Was wonderful to walk out of our Hotel onto the Beach.  You can do anything with regards to water sports along the Beach plenty of places offering anything from Jet Ski's to canoes etc so shop around for a good price.  Lots of ladies offering Massages at cheaper prices than the Hotel - very good value for money.  Nice little shops with beverages at good prices.  You can also do a bit of shopping at the stalls along the beach.  Was lovely to see how many Weddings took place.  Only when the wind blows there is no protection.
PatsyDerby,"Derby, UK",Jul 2011,"Super beach - Melia Bali hotel - liked the relaxing atmosphere, friendly staff and hospitality of Bali people.  Prices in hotel are expensive though for drinks and meals.  Excellent meals available outside hotel resorts at 'Bali Experience' short walk away - shops, restaurants, etc.  Loved the beach massage by locals - outside of the Hotel beach area. Must see the island if you are visiting here - hotel trips expensive - hire your own taxi driver/tour operator - just excellent value and a great way to get to know the locals and traditions - at your own pace, in your own time.  Would greatly recommend I Gede Suwarsana Tour Organizer."
Shona_Deb,"Pune, India",May 2011,This is the place where you will find lots of sports activity with very helpful people and nice discounts
rinoromeyn R,"Oslo, Norway",Feb 2011,"The beach in Nusa Dua is not that much fun if you are not in one of the many big resorts. The complete promenade is filled with long stretching expensive looking resorts, which own all the sunbeds. Yes, the beach is quite clean, has great yellow sand and the waters are clear and clean, but there is no atmosphere around this beach. We tried to relax between the two peninsulas, but over there you are only allowed to stay at a small lane, because the rest is owned by another resort. It is funny to drive around in Nusa Dua, because it is totally different compared to the rest of Bali. It is a secured village, all set-up for expensive tourism, with beautiful gardens etc. but it really misses a soul and you feel that during your stay on the beach. As long as you are not a rich person who enjoys all this drive only through Nusa Dua so you have seen it and than go to Pantai Geger (Geger Beach), which is on the side of Nusa Dua. That beach has a soul and great atmosphere."
MADHURKJAIN,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2019,Pristine white sandy beach. Ideal place to relax or swim. Located in the vicinity of a chain of high end hotels. Amazing sunset views
ind,"England, UK",Sep 2019,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn‚Äôt list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we‚Äôre not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of ‚Äúsand on, stress off‚Äù after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn‚Äôt hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you‚Äôll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‚Äòmovers and shakers‚Äô, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‚Äòescape‚Äô and you‚Äôll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I‚Äôll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what‚Äôs not to like?....Indu & Versha."
PrestonGuild,United Kingdom,Jul 2019,"Once you go past Legian beach you are on Seminyak Beach.There are also some high end hotels on the vicinity and I noted that it was less busier here.A nice place to have a stroll, popular with surfers and it was relatively clean."
Aslam_Sherif,"London, UK",Aug 2019,Seminyak beach is nice and clean. I found it some parts is is very busy and loud and other parts it is very quiet.I had an ocean view room at the hotel I was staying and the view was very relaxing.
Sandy Ta,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"Purposely chose Seminyak beach of all places in Bali for my trip as I wanted to learn surfing (first timer) and heard the food/drinks options are great. It was the right decisions. The beach was beautiful, lively but not so crowded. Many drink stalls along the main stretch of the beach (near La Plancha) which also rented out beach chairs for you to sit down and the staff were always ready to tell a tales or two to entertain you. The surfing booths were everywhere but not all of them are reputable so do your research before hand. Swimming is possible but try to void those places with warning flag and those with a lot of surfers."
Mansi Reddy,"Chennai (Madras), India",Oct 2019,"We stayed at the W Bali and had easy access to the beach. We absolutely loved this beach, lots of lovely beach bars with very comfortable loungers, amazing sunsets and a fabulous party vibe at night."
Aloysius170,"Sumba, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"I have been living in Seminyak village for 10 years in 1976, Although I love walking on the beach I heard many time people drawned here because the undercurrent is very strong. It is a black sand beach and when clear it is great for sunset photoes"
Flare,"Helsinki, Finland",Mar 2019,"Dissapointment after Nusa Dua quiet beaches. This beach was a party beach, noicy, grouded and parties all night long."
BA2727,"Guildford, UK",Dec 2019,"Flat busy beach, dark dirty sand.  Just didnt like it.  Water cleanliness quality is meant to be an issue to."
Rie06,"Chicago, IL",Aug 2019,"Very nice beach. I went in the late afternoon, and it wasn‚Äôt very crowded. The beach is very clean, and the water was clear. Nice, relaxing experience. Know that you pay to use the loungers, and there are people selling things like sunglasses and bracelets."
vanessasmith75,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,"Love staying at the beach for just relaxing or chit chat with family and friends. Beside double six area, sometimes i go to seminyak beach to spend time with family or friends. Not really clean beach but is ok. "
2TravellingGeordies,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Dec 2019,Stayed in Seminyak for 5 days. Visited the beach three times and very disappointed with the amount of plastics on the beach..never been anywhere and seen such an amount of plastics from high to low water. Tourists actually walking along picking up all the debris. There are tractors on the beach raking the sand but not picking up and debris. Find it hard to believe that the tourist board/government allow tourists to swim and paddle  amongst this filth. The amount tourism brings to Bali then take some of your tourists money and pay local people to pick up the rubbish... the amount of rubbish on the beach depends upon rainfall flooding the rivers and taking it down to settle on the beaches. Anyone going in the sea comes face to face with the rubbish pity help any other unseen nasties are in the water...... expect a tourism tax to be incurred if action taken to clean up.
Akshat G,273 contributions,Dec 2019,Supposed to be one of the best beaches in Bali - this beach let us down a bit. Water was rough and beach wasn‚Äôt very scenic 
Craig C,"Ashford, UK",Dec 2019,"Not the best beach however well used by tourist and locals, they are making an effort to clean it daily but could be better... many activities available for people to try..."
CopperBeauty,30 contributions,Dec 2019,"The beach wasn‚Äôt too crowded, considering the large volume of people in the area for the new year celebration. Lots of space to spread out with a beach chair and enjoy the gorgeous water and a fancy cocktail."
Catherine Liew,40 contributions,Dec 2019,Went for a walk at the beach to catch the sunset. Don't expect a white sandy beach. It is black sand here. Dissapointed with how dirty the beach was with lots of plastic floating around. 
Stephen C,"1,055 contributions",Dec 2019,Came here to watch the sunset. Camped ourselves at the Potato Head and strolled onto the beach to catch the beautiful endless rolling waves.The volcanic ash sand is very good on the eyes and nice to tread on. The beach was also very clean. The wide open sea was therefore very inviting and it is hard to see why so many enjoy taking a dip in the waters here.Personally I find the beach here to be nicer than the ones in Nusa Day.
P S,"Tulum, Mexico",Nov 2019,There was litter everywhere and hardly any restaurants that were open. Overall not the best beach that we visited during our visit.
Jaya K,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2019,Our visits to Seminyak beach was good. Pleasant and clean beach. It was extremely hot at the time we visited.  
William A,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2019,Great beach to walk and find a cool bar and restuarant. Local shops along the beach with small vendors. Can rent body boards or surfboards all over. Waves are decent and water is nice and warm. Rent a chair on the beach and relax along side the kids selling bracelets to you.
Sara Alure,5 contributions,Dec 2019,better than Canggu. nicer friendly vibes. many nice places around good food good yoga good massage and good accommodations around here 
DJM,9 contributions,Aug 2019,"Seminyak beach is always a fun place to stroll along with friends and family during june to october. We could experience The sun but at the same time the cool breeze from the winter in Australia will blow to the whole of bali, making the weather perfect!! You would also see people run and walk with their dogs. Others would just enjoy the sound of wave with a glass of wine or beer or wiskey. Amazing."
Ross G,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2019,"beers on the beach under a beachbar umbrella, watching the surfers and beach walkers.experiencing the magical sunset.beautiful experiences"
smithtan,12 contributions,Dec 2019,"It's superb with beautiful sunset, it's magical black sand beach. Recommended to you once you visit seminyak bali."
Haileymarit,"Kodiak Island, AK",Dec 2019,"The beach was okay. Stays shallow for awhile but has a big break , so not good for swimming. It was also very dirty in the water and beach. Farther up ‚Äúnorth‚Äù of Seminyak beach google pin is the only section we saw that wasn‚Äôt dirty or littered. Farther down towards Kuta was so cluttered with litter it wasn‚Äôt even enjoyable to walk on the beach. Also a pretty windy beach. Definitely not a picture perfect ‚ÄúBali‚Äù beach , but enjoyable and you can have a great beach day if you make the most of it. "
Tris,5 contributions,Dec 2019,"Stay in seminyak, don't forget to visit this beautiful beach with alot entertains in surrounding. Best recommended beach in Bali"
Ren√© de Beer,5 contributions,Dec 2019,We loved this beach.. Best for body surfing. 6-8 foot waves so not for little kids.. The water was refreshing. The best sunset every evening.
Angelo G,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,The beach was not that packed however it is sad to see the amount of plastic pollution on the shore.  The seating area is adorned with faded Air Asia beach umbrellas and the odd dog or two.  More reason to be careful about where you step.  
Bryan O,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2019,"Seminyak is a niece clean beach, with some good ammenities. You can rent sun beds which are very comfortable all be it a little pricey at AU$10 each but if you were to stay for a day , it‚Äôs good value. The water is good but a fair bit of plastic debris. Watch out getting taxis from here as they try and extract as much as they can. Either insist on the meter or barter the price beforehand."
WorldTravellerOz,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,This is not the cleanest beach in the world but it has an appeal especially at sunset.Lovely walk along the beach here.
Suzenne,14 contributions,Dec 2019,Took a short stroll from our hotel at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak to catch the beautiful sunset. We didn‚Äôt manage to catch the sunrise or chill in the afternoon there but overall is Nice beach with fine sand. 
4Boys,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2019,Love this spot. Great for a night relaxing on the beach laying on a bean bag with music and food readily available 
Jackiefm,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2019,Nothing is better then hiring a sunbed for the day ($5) and taking in the sun and surf. Of course people watching is at its prime!!
Stephen B,"Manchester, UK",Dec 2019,"Beautiful beech with lots of bars, the prices for places to eat and drink were about normal for most places in Bali so no opportunity to snag a deal but none the less well worth going "
kkulasingamk,7 contributions,Dec 2019,Nice wide beach. Can hire deck chairs to sunbathe. Soft drinks & beers may be ordered and served at your chair. Rolling waves. Great for surfing beginners. Clean & cool seawater. Very invigorating.
lily w,Singapore,Dec 2019,"Sunset in Bali is beautiful, sunset view from Seminyak beach is breathtaking! It is one of the must go and see places every time I have a visitor in town, it‚Äôs a signature snapshot of the amazing Bali!"
Kristin S.,"Silverthorne, CO",Nov 2019,Fun to watch turtle release in the morning on the beach!!  We enjoyed renting beach chairs fronting the ocean watching the surf lessons and ability to walk up to grab a water or a cocktail!
Clare S,"Coventry, UK",Nov 2019,A variety of eating places with a mix of street food and table service. The beach is clean and the sea clear.Hot during the day but plenty of beds and umbrellas to hire. 
Davy Boy,4 contributions,Nov 2019,"Shopping in Seminyak I was sweating majorly , wandered down to Seminyak beach and wow how refreshing.  Clean water, nice size surf. The best."
Susan B,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2019,"We spent a few afternoons and evenings down at the beach.  We sat in the beanbags on the beach, ordered some beers and watched amazing sunsets.  We live in Perth and see the sun setting over the ocean often, but this was different.  It was just beautiful.The beach had a great vibe. Loved it."
AndyTen,Germany,Nov 2019,"The beach for me is close to perfect when it comes for a beach vacation.The water is cleaner than at other spots few hundred meters North or South. Good for swimming (look for the red/yellow flags) and surfing.However do not expect paradise beach, higher waves mean water not so clear and water not Caribbean azure.In the evenings there are plenty of beach bars where you can sit with feet in the sand watching the ocean - for every budget you will find something that suits your pocket, style and taste."
Marc W,"Austin, TX",Nov 2019,"We were staying close so hot this beach several times. Nice sand, plenty of chairs and a great sunset. The guys that rented our chairs also had cheap beer, bonus. The water itself was nothing spectacular, big waves so no real swimming just wading. Surfing if your into it.lots of restaurants along the beach too."
Flaves73,"Bendigo, Australia",Nov 2019,"Seminyak beach is the best place to experience a breath taking Bali sunset. The beach comes to life as the sun goes down with live music, bars and seating."
Jignakp,"London, UK",Nov 2019,"Lovely clear water. Very busy beach, so best to go early in the morning,  the water is not too cold. Very popular surfing location to. This beach is not rocky like dreamland beach further south"
fredamy65,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019,Plenty of space with minimal to nil hawkersRecommend if you are learning to surf. Predictable waves and not too big
Andrew O,"San Remo, Australia",Nov 2019,"Went to the beach club to have a couple of drinks to watch an amazing sunset , need to spend $50 Australian to have a day bed which is basically 4 mixed drinks Definitely a must to experience "
Rachael Colette,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"My husband and I strolled along the beach from 4.45pm till sunset at about 6pm. It was amazing! However, we noticed that dirty water flowed into the sea at certain parts along the beach. Although it is only natural, seeing and smelling it turned us off and we did not want to play in the water. Be vigilant to watch where you are walking as well because we found broken beer bottles shards in the sand. Overall, it was a beautiful beach and watching cute dogs run around the beach was a bonus. "
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2019,"Coming here my whole life, it‚Äôs a great beach and it‚Äôs clean. Lots of hotels etc around aswel as beach bars and little warungs. Great for all and also for having a walk with your dog ."
Empressb,3 contributions,Nov 2019,Lovely friendly beach with lots of colourful beanbags in my opinion its more of a evening beach hangout
Paul M,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2019,End the day watching the sun drop into the ocean. Sip on a cocktail spread out on the beanbags. Must do on your Bali itinerary.
Dave s,"Deal, United Kingdom",Nov 2019,"Quiet beach superb for surfing and lazing around,spectacular sunsets and great bars and music.sunbeds a must as its hot!"
Agnes Perez,"Manila, Philippines",Nov 2019,Most stylish and upscale beach resort! We enjoyed the vies and the water! We will come back for sure!
iamkayoh,472 contributions,Nov 2019,Beach is pretty clean except for occasional bits of drink bottles left on the beach. Nice place to sunbathe with a ice cold Bintang or coconut! Beware of stalls charging overpriced drinks though. Check the price before ordering and sitting down at the beach chairs. One of them charged me IDR200K for a coconut!Do look out!
gypsygirl52,"Busselton, Australia",Nov 2019,Staying in Seminyak only 3 Nights so.plenty to see and do.We did manage to get to see the Beach a shirt walk from  Seminyak Square.We did not hire Sun beds could have got them for 7000 each with a little bartering. The Beach was clean not much Surf that day.Lots of places to grab a bite to eat and a lovely place to watch the Sun Set.
Meg,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2019,"The beach had soft sand and lots of beach chairs. There are heaps of restaurants, bars and surf schools along the beach here. The sand gets very hot in the sun, so we went at 8am to swim before it gets unbearable. Lots of street dogs, but they mostly leave you alone.Beautiful sunsets after 6pm, reccomend arriving around 5:30pm to take it all in."
Mark B,"Mosman, Australia",Nov 2019,"I visited Seminyak Beach because it was close to our Villa - but what a horrible beach. Black sand, dogs defecating and urinating everywhere. Rubbish blowing all over the place. I wouldn't go back."
Sanku,"Waidhan, India",Nov 2019,Beautiful beach. One of the Best Sunset View point. Clean beach & Good place to dive in. Lots of beach side Cafe & Pubs are there. These are one of the best Beach Clubs of Bali. Must visit place. 
Darlene K,"Colorado Springs, CO",Nov 2019,"Many beachfront restaurants to choose from  to enjoy watching the beautiful sunset while you eat dinner. It is popular, so you will be in the company of many who are in celebratory moods. In contrast, early morning walks on this same beach are quiet and peaceful."
Elyze,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"We are here to watch the sunset. A lot of restaurants by the beach and a lot of locals trying to sell you things. Nevertheless, it is still a good place to chill and have a long romantic walk with your loved ones."
Palesa,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2019,"Loved it. Absolutely... little to no waves, I‚Äôm happy with the small restaurant there, great service and very friendly"
stephanie C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2019,"We ended up having an evening stroll along the beach around sunset which we thorougly enjoyed.Had we wanted an evening meal,there were numerous well patronised  restaurants from which we could have chosen. The beach was clean and others like us, both locals and tourists were taking advantage of using this lovely spot for recreational purposes."
Max H,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2019,"Reality sinks in on this beach. Plastic, garbage,netting, fisherman's wires and litter everywhere. Dead fish line the beach as well. Very sad to see. Sand is very dark so water seems very dark- barely able to see my feet while swimming next to ramen noodle packets. Sunset is lovely, as it is worldwide. Nice to see the million yoga poses and selfies being made next to the litter. "
Emma W,8 contributions,Nov 2019,Great beach with sun beds these cost approx 100 rupees to hire for as long as you want.   Water is warm but quite rough to swim in.  But an ideal place to spend the day being lazy.   Also ideal place to watch the famous sunsets
Dan A,"Donnybrook, Australia",Nov 2019,"A wonderful place to sit back relax and watch the sun set while listening to great live music.Jus sit back in your bean bag, enjoy a drink, meal or even a massage. Fantastic spot."
MPAINTAL,"Panjim, India",Nov 2019,Beautiful beach clean and lovely water. Nice ambience...then just like all Bali beaches well maintained and managed and peaceful.  
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Nov 2019,"Seminyak Beach is relatively quiet during the day. It's cool, sunny and breezy ambience provides a great place for hanging out, sunbathing and swimming. Surfing is allowed in certain areas of the beach. There are plenty of restaurants/bars nearby so you can relax, have a drink and meals while enjoying people watching or the sunset. "
lucasi1911,19 contributions,Nov 2019,"The only nice thing about this beach is the sunset. Full of rubbish and plastic bottles. In the evening all the beach clubs put on the beach a lot of bean bags, all broken. You can see a million pieces of polystyrene beads flying around and so many cigarettes butts. It‚Äôs really sad as they all end up in the sea..."
Matt B G,"Auckland, New Zealand",Nov 2019,"Great beach at sunset, or any time of the day. There is some litter but they are trying to sort the issue. The biggest issue for us was the shear quantity of hawkers. At one stage whilst trying to see the sunset we had 3 bothering us and whilst they aren't threatening they are persistent.There were signs warning about rips so we didn't swim but it isn't really a swimming beach as there are big waves."
CCarlos75,"Sacramento, CA",Oct 2019,My Villa was a 5 minute walk from Seminyak Beach and I enjoyed jogging early in the morning during sunrise...when the temperature was perfect and beach wasn't crowded. Very clean beach
Regina M,53 contributions,Nov 2019,"Wake up at 5am and walk by Seminyak beach was my ritual during vacation. It was beautiful, only 2/3 people showed up during that time. As the sun goes up, people started showing up for jogging, walking the dog or just hanging out enjoying the beach."
Michael v,"Redland City, Australia",Oct 2019,Beautiful spot to enjoy the sunset on a beanbag with a bevy and some nibblies. Just don‚Äôt use the beach toilet you have to pay to use. Disgusting.
pmickey,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2019,"The beach is very clean , we where here in oct November the flags most days where red and yellow, good to play in the water near shore line , or surf , but not great for swimming, could have been this time of year, but it was really nice sand , and clean and not many vendors asking you to buy something, "
N2N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2019,We just took a walk along the beach and enjoyed the sunset. Definitely great beach to visiting whilst in Seminyak.
Pedro L,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Oct 2019,"Expensive umbrella/chair rentals and signs say swimming is prohibited, although people ignored that restriction.  Still, it was nice scenery."
Tracey R,31 contributions,Oct 2019,beach was beautiful nice breeze from see all day clean and tidy. only pitiful is the the people who sell on the beach dont listen when you tell them no. other than that beautiful clean beach
nonina70,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Nov 2019,You can enjoy by staying at places that have condition minimum order start from 100k..the difference only the place higher because they give more exclusive place
colleen t,"Winchelsea, Australia",Oct 2019,Last time I was in Seminyak was four years ago and I can‚Äôt believe the change in the condition of the beach.Clean and uncluttered!!!Great work to all
John C,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"Great beach, great sun beds  Some surf schools and beach side massage During the day it is quite as the sun sets the place gets busy with some music But the Sunset is spectacular "
Stan S,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,Came here to see the sun set. Beautiful white sandy beach with clear waters. Lovely view of sun-set. There is a swing with the words Petitenget ideal for Instagram. No drinks stalls or cushions littering the beach like Kuta. Less commercialized. One word - beautiful.
jane s,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2019,Nothing better than spending a sunset at the beach. Grab a beanbag a cocktail menu and your in for a great time with friends 
Rodney J,"Neutral Bay, Australia",Oct 2019,"Just beautiful, better than I could of imgined. A great way to walk from the many resorts and beachfront restaurants."
Pathfinder221035,2 contributions,Oct 2019,"Not many beach bed options, but it was quiet when we were there. The current is strong and would not be suitable for young children."
G & H Travel,"Essex, UK",Oct 2019,"The beach itself is okay, the sunbeds are really comfy and you can get two sunbeds for 3 hours for 150k. There are a few nice restaurants. The sunset is amazing though and this is why you come here. It is however quite touristy and the sea is quite rough so be careful."
Anne T,3 contributions,Oct 2019,This beach is not the golden sand with palm trees I was expecting. The sand is fine but the sea is dangerous. The waves and current are deceiving. There are red flags saying do not swim between and the life guards are constantly blowing their whistles to get you out of the water. The waves are  reminiscent of the Posiden Adventure!!!!
PhoenixT,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Oct 2019,"The beach is not ideal for swimming and current is strong and waves can be high plus I believe is not very clean either. But great for sunsets and the atmosphere at that time is so good with bars and beach huts are filled with people and singers, highly recommended for this experience."
Wayne,3 contributions,Oct 2019,Awesome beach. Great to see the beach is swept of litter each morningWould recommend too all. Night music/entertainment and plenty of bean bags to lounge on.
Lorie R,20 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing, vast beach.  Great for a walk, at times the surf is quite high.  Have to get used to the ladies and gentlemen peddling their wares on the beach. "
Lata P,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2019,The beach is crowded but nothing like seeing the sun set in the ocean. Yes of course you will have better choices to see the beach at Gili islands or in uluwatu. But the beach wasn't dirty just crowded.
Frank M,"Glasgow, UK",Oct 2019,The most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. Sit and relax with a cold drink. It‚Äôs awesome you can hire a decked seat or just layOn the beach. Lots of surfers to watch.
Prof. Andrew John y Fernandes,"Valenzuela, Philippines",Oct 2019,"The usual Asian beach with grey sand, warm waters and features a longer sand base. Sadly, quite dirty"
danielle166,"Medan, Indonesia",Aug 2019,It's must to watch sunset here.Sandy beach with whole lot crowd but it's still has its own beauty. Go around 5 p.m. you should go earlier though to avoid traffic jam.You'll see one of the most amazing sunset here.
Jacqui S,"London, UK",Oct 2019,"This is an absolutely beautiful beach to go to and see an amazing sunset, one of the best yet , we even sent friends there and they had the same experience as us, and you also have to try the roast corn on the cob on the beach. Wow"
Barrie Rogers,59 contributions,Sep 2019,"Great place to sit back in a bean chair, take in the sunset and enjoy a cold beverage at the end of the day"
EucalyptDrive,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,"We wanted experience the amazing sunset along the beach, we were not disappointed.People all over the place enjoying the sunset, bring a camera as the shots are amazing. "
David V,"Baton Rouge, LA",Oct 2019,"We just took a walk along the beach.  Was a very gradual slope to the water.  Pretty big waves, surfers there. Chairs and umbrellas to sit on."
cantleyblade,Doncaster,Oct 2019,"Lengthy, clean, plenty of sun beds, umbrellas, beanbags, drinks facilities, surfing facilities.Waves can be very strong, so beware. Invariably breezy, so perfect to get a great tan."
Glen A,11 contributions,Oct 2019,We visited the beach in the afternoon on our way back home and it was nice just to take a stroll in the sand and soak in the beauty of the beach...
Gary B,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,Lovely Seminyak beach with lots of great bars / restaurants to choose from.Within walking distance of Seminyak Square.
RayMads,"South Morang, Australia",Oct 2019,We visited the beach the afternoon of our departure back home. It was nice to just wander and soak in the beauty
James,"Kuta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,Locals so happy and helpful felt very safe for the cost of little money for a cool coconut drink and a Bintang we got to sit in the shade and watch the beach life and shopping close by for bargains ..... so good recommend ..... lots of private cars and taxes to get you back to your accommodation 
Chris G,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2019,One of the nicest beaches you will ever walk upon and the sunset is beautiful to watch from here. Definitely a beach worth visiting whilst in Bali.
sasidar30,"Coimbatore, India",Oct 2019,I guess it‚Äôs the most busiest beaches in Bali... I see a lot of local connect like the Sanur and unlike the nusa dua beach..It‚Äôs pretty hot in October.. so you have to carry what ever is necessary 
Rod W,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"The reality is that it is extremely hotThere's no white sand, it's grey gravel and no real surf.Hence no one is there.Plus the rubbish, everywhere "
Geordie K,"Cavite City, Philippines",Oct 2019,The beach is very popular and a great place to watch the sunset. Lots of surfing going on and you must stay within the flags to avoid the rip currents but it is very safe and plenty of food and drinking available all along the beach 
Gus Dark,Indonesia,Aug 2019,"Geez, they should build big parking building, a Multistorey car park on the empty land near the beach otherwise sooner or later people will come with bad atmosphere, which make the awesome sunset beach fullfilled with negative atmosphere caused by bad traffic around the area. Stop build Hotels or beach clubs here, all stackholders in this areas should re-think again about where Seminyak going in the near future."
Amit Agarwal,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2019,"This is the best I found in Bali, have many restaurants with shisha / Liquor and lovely food.One should try it"
luxurytraveller1964,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,The beach was clean and safe.  Lots of tourists and a wonderful way to enjoy the Bali culture.  Not too many locals looking to sell their wares makes this a relaxing location and perfect for watch the sun set each evening.
ozsarah,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2019,Fantastic beach and a great place to watch the surfers. Great beach lounges so you don‚Äôt have to be on the sand. 
Graham Dinwoodie,"Glasgow, UK",Sep 2019,Stunning beach very clean not to busy plenty to do from surfing to scuba diving and just having a beer and watching what has got to be the most romantic sunset to watch with your wife 
Eka A,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"This part of the beach is flat and long beach. You can do pretty much many activities, surf, soccer, swimming in the ocean, ride, kite flying, etc, etcBefore Sunset, many hotels and restaurants will put a bean bag along the beach and pumping with music. Love it Love it"
Dharmadji5,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"Could not sleep so I decide to take an early walk and catch a sunrise. To my wonderful surprise how fresh air and sandy beach while waiting for sunrise can be rejuvenated myself! There weren‚Äôt many people, but jogger and Jetleg tourist w their selfie mode were a few. Walked for an hour and finally watched the sun cracking the horizon to begin the new day. It‚Äôs plain beautiful thing to start your day in Bali. Perfecto"
Diane K,4 contributions,Oct 2019,Went for the sunset and it did not disappoint! You can grab a bean bag and a drink while you are there too. 
Shanster,"Auckland, New Zealand",Oct 2019,"Wonderful way to spend the day. We had a separate part of the beach due to the Marriott so no crowding, friendly attendant. Free water, lounges, towels, and wifi. Top notch."
MoreChill132,5 contributions,Sep 2019,"Big beach, full of people and buzzing atmosphere. Not gonna lie the sand looked a bit dirty and almost looked like a black sand beach."
al22tecc,Philippines,Aug 2019,"Very long and very wide beach, we strolled along the shoreline and eventually found ourselves where a lot of beach bean bags were placed in front of several restaurant/bars, for the purpose of watching the sunset.  It was very very crowded, and it will take some patience to get an available space.We eventually stayed and ordered dinner which was right after the sunset and it was still a relaxing moment.  After an hour or so, we slowly walked back to our villa hotel somewhere in Seminyak."
"Armando M. frm: Manila, Phil's.","Manila, Philippines",Oct 2019,I can say is this beach is typical Balinese beach. All beaches are similar and good for swimming. A place good for family. 
NZNicky,"Matamata, New Zealand",Sep 2019,"We are staying at the Furamaxclusive right on the beach at Seminyak & today my daughter & myself went for a swim at the beach & both of us were surprised how clean & clear the water was.. in fact my daughter said that‚Äôs the best beach she has ever swam at ( & there are some awesome beaches in NZ)!!Everyone on the beach is so friendly .. yes the hawkers do bother you but that‚Äôs all part of the Bali fun!!Sunset time is just the best!! You can hire sun loungers or bean bags to sit , relax drink a few cold Bintangs & just enjoy a spectacular sunset. This time has made up a very special part of our holiday. This beach is awesome!!"
Lou P,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,you cannot swim here as the sewer outlets are all nearby. also the shape of the bay does not allow the pollution in the water to disperse into the ocean. this is a swim at your very own risk.
Yanis L,3 contributions,Sep 2019,"Very popular beach, full of bars and restaurants, very lively, and not too tacky even if it is far from being an exclusive and stylish place."
Martyn J,"London, UK",Sep 2019,"Very long beach can walk for hours if you are feeling fit. Fine sand all the way.Beds are 100k IDR (¬£6), and bed guys also sell ife cold beers and waters 10k.Yes you get the locals trying to sell you bits and pieces but they never hassle. Just walk away as soon as you say no thank you.With this in mind it's one of the safest beaches I've sunbathe on. We walked for an hour and left our bags, also went for lunch and nothing was touched. Even felt comfortable leaving the misses while I popped back to the hotel. The waves are stunning, especially at high tide. No rocks in the water just lush sand. This beach made our holiday."
Taylor Breaux (Mrs.),"Eugene, OR",Sep 2019,Beautiful beach that is surrounded with pleasant restaurants and nice shopping nearby at Seminyak Square. 
Lesha G,"Durban, South Africa",Sep 2019,Beautiful shoreline. Amazing sunset. You do not have to drive all the way to Jimbaran for a stunning sunset. 
–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–∞–Ω–¥—Ä –§,"Moscow, Russia",Sep 2019,"TL;DR: Hands down the best beach in Bali.Okay, the situation is a bit silly. We came to the Seminyak from the airport at night, didn‚Äôt like the traffic and decided to see all the best beaches first before deciding where to live.So the next day at the early morning we started to explore them (not seeing Seminyak beach first!).Canggu, Munggu, Jimbaran, Dreamland, Melasti, Padang-Padang, Sanur (and some other places along the way) - whole day drive.Came back frustrated at night, no amazing beaches, if you were in Philippines, Thailand, Goa etc you understand, Bali beaches are average at best. Yeah, Melasti wedding pictures are nice, but it‚Äôs not for swimming, living and relaxing.Next day we saw Seminyak beach 100m from our hotel (right at the Ku De Ta).Ocean waves, tender and smooth light yellow sand, wide and bright beach kilometers long.It‚Äôs perfect.Seminyak is the most expensive place for a reason."
Siska B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,If you can learn to say no to the people selling you things while you lay on your subbed you paid $10 for with umbrella for the whole day you will love the beach in seminyak. Restaurants near buy who will deliver to your  day bed ! In all t yhe photos o had seen thought it would be a dirty beach but was lovely even the water was amazing. 
Irena N,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"We stayed at the Anantara hotel. It was fabulous - for service, pools, Buffet breakfast dinner experiences rooftop bar and restaurant. The staff could not have been more helpful or polite or just genuinely friendly and concerned for our enjoyment. "
Asenster,"Burgas, Bulgaria",Sep 2019,"It is very nice wide beach. It is perfect to drink cocktails, watch sunsets, listening live music, sunbathing, eat!"
Farkwad,"Agnes Water, Australia",Sep 2019,Awesome western sunsets into the Water with well priced beers sun beds and restaurants. Great swimming and fun for the whole family. 
Benholhar,"Penarth, UK",Sep 2019,Lovely setting to watch sunset on beach with a cocktail or two. Plenty of choice for drinks and views gets busy around 5pm so find a seat early 
Nick9289,"Castle Donington, UK",Sep 2019,Great time to walk on the beach just before sunset. It is very clean with very nice views to look at. 
Arun714,"Hokkaido, Japan",Sep 2019,"Great beach for sunsets, walks, kiteflying, playing in the sand relaxing on deckchairs and learning how to surf. Not good for swimming."
Louise P,"Cabarita Beach, Australia",Sep 2019,We loved Seminyak Beach! It‚Äôs clean and the water is beautiful. It‚Äôs busy at sunset everyday but there‚Äôs plenty of room to spread out and countless beach clubs to sit and watch the sunset from. It‚Äôs way better than the pictures you see on the internet. Seminyak is a great place in Bali to visit ‚ù£Ô∏è
KGinBris,"Ipswich, Australia",Sep 2019,"Awesome, affordable. You will soon get over the hawkers. Kick back, fall on a bean bag, apply some sunscreen, get yourself a lemon beer, laugh and talk and eat and drink and watch the sunset. You will only be slightly poorer but also a hell of a lot richer. Trust me."
Dennis P,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,The beach is very long  with good waves adequate for both swimmers and surfing.Small sections  are patrolled and while we were there large areas were closed to swimmers due to dangerous ripsSand near edges rather on the heavy and on the slightly dirty side. Sun lounges etc available for hire at reasonable prices. Without these there is little or no shade
MrOyvind,"Newport, Australia",Sep 2019,"This is a tough one.  The black volcanic sand and crashing waves on a beach fronted by fancy beach clubs and posh hotels make you think this is one of those wow exotic beaches.But the water is horrible.  Litter of all kinds (I‚Äôm talking nappies and toothbrushes) are sadly all too easy to find.  The daily raking by tractor does a great job clearing the sand, but does little for the water.Bali is on a long and excellent journey to be plastic free.  Hopefully with that comes a cleaner overall environment that we are all responsible for."
Sheep_green,"Cardiff, UK",Sep 2019,"Seminyak Beach tends to be busier than the nearby beach of Kuta but the break can still be very strong. There are plenty of hotels and cafes offering sunbeds and lots of places to grab a snack and drink. However it is also possible to find slightly quieter areas, with plenty of space for everyone."
Jane M,"Bolton, UK",Sep 2019,This has to be one of the most beautiful sights ever it‚Äôs something every one who visits Bali has to see
Laurin K,"Victoria, Canada",Sep 2019,"A great long stretch of beach, great for watersports and sunsets! Fairly busy as most of the hotels are right on the beach, but a great spot when in Seminyak. Sand is super soft and lovely on the southern section of the beach!"
Jerry G,"Horseshoe Bay, TX",Sep 2019,We visited on September 18th and it was very nice.   Big waves added to the fun.  Nice sand.A great place to visit if you want to get out of the pool and join the crowd of beach people ü§£ü§£
Richard W,"Kingscote, UK",Sep 2019,"Been down the beach a couple of times, lots of waves, ideal for üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, but no good for swimming, üö© everywhere, only got approached by 7 beach vendors while we were there for the 1 hour before we headed back inland away from the ‚òÄÔ∏è. "
Niels H,25 contributions,Oct 2018,"While in Seminyak we spent many hours at the Seminyak beach , great swimming and activities happening everywhere , easy to get a cool beer also"
greatlife64,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,"During my recent stay at Batu Belig Seminyak, we had several opportunities and enjoyed walking the long stretches of Seminyak beaches. Nice, fine sand and easy to walk. Not crowded, unlike Kuta. Particularly enjoyed the evening walk, the beautiful sunsets and just simply watching the waves ... nice and relaxing! "
John W,"Croydon, UK",Aug 2019,Great views and always busy and things to see. Out hotel Samaya on the beach front and we did walk along and saw shrines and restaurants
James A,"Essex, UK",Sep 2019,Less busy than Kuta or Padma - and cleaner too! Great for a long walk towards Seminyak Square. Can‚Äôt fault it
Leicaman8,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"Kuta beach is hectic jammed with small beer stalls , plastic chairs and cheap beer and many hawkers while Seminyak beach has a different feel with more surf üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è schools , more upmarket beach bars with bean bags and Bali umbrellas eg. La Plancha . Less hawkers as well . I recommend morning walk in beach towards Legian and Kuta for people watching and notice the changes as you head towards Legian and Kuta . "
MancJRG,"Warrington, UK",Sep 2019,"Seminyak is a long beach that merges into Legian and Kuta as you head towards the airport.  It's a wide beach with good waves for surfing and body boarding.  Watch out for rip tides/currents and follow beach flags for safe swimming.  The beach is quite coarse at points with broken coral and shells, so wear your water shoes if you go swimming.The beach has a few local sellers who approach to offer their crafts, a simple 'no thankyou' and you are left in peace - no hard sales chat.  There are a few dogs on the beach too but are often searching for shade under a lounger and not approaching people.  My one grievance is there are a few rivers from the town that run straight into the ocean and appears grey and unclean. "
Vishal W,35 contributions,Aug 2019,"This one word describes the beach best. I took a bike from Kuta for a day tour to Seminyak and wasn't disappointed. Lovely, clean beach that wasn't as busy as Kuta. Best part was the evening sunset walk by the beach back to Kuta."
Sailesh D,"London, UK",Feb 2019,"It is a great place to visit. White hot sandy beach all round. Very busy place, Lots of restaurants and plenty to do or just relax on the beach."
Deb321_13,"Bethlehem, PA",Sep 2019,A great beach.  Clean  went for sunset. Was amazing. Can sit in bean bag chairs if you eat or buy a drink. Does not have to be alcoholic. The sunset was awesome!
benny,3 contributions,Sep 2019,Not many people on the beach when I visited.  I‚Äôm not sure if it was because of the wind or because of the black sand.  
dmcallis73,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,Recommend during they day it is nice. And definitely go at night to one of the bats to sit on a beanbag to relax with a drink.
WERUN MARBELLA,"Marbella, Spain",Sep 2019,"If you want a great sunset at the beach, this is the place. I let the images speaks for itself. We came about 17:30 and the sun went down in the most magical way around 18:15. Film of the sunset can be viewed on our Instagram: @werun_com "
chins01,"Brooklyn, NY",Aug 2019,It's a nice beach but great views at sunset but there are definitely nicer beaches in Bali.¬† The beaches over in Uluwatu are cleaner and more beautiful.The nice part about this beach is that it's one long continuous beach. We ended up walking all the way from Canggu to Seminyak and then down to Legian and Kuta.
Granules2013,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2019,"Walked along this beach a few times in the morning, nice to get their early before it gets too busy. Great spot to do a learn to surf class. "
Marjan,"Kuta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,We spent hours just strolling on this beautiful beach and tried some bars along the promenade. Very nice to see sunset also. 
val brauninger,13 contributions,Sep 2019,Long long sandy beach - plenty of places to eat and drink Sun bed prices are very negotiable so haggle hard
Davidgoodkarma,"McAllen, TX",Sep 2019,If you wish to bask in a postcard-perfect Bali sunset then Seminyak beach is where you wanna be! Fun bars and beautiful friendly people make this beach a fun favorite of mine! Traveling half around the world to join my friends on this exotic island is well worth the jet lag... We‚Äôve just arrived and we‚Äôre already glowing in Seminyak‚Äôs golden hour sunset!
Freedom85315,"Tanjung Benoa, Indonesia",Sep 2019,Wow sunset at Seminyak beach do not miss it! So many people such good fun! Felt like being at a hippy festival loved it! Bright colourful bean bags and parasols decorate the beach. Great food and drink and the beach bars (honestly don't bother with the up market bars restaurants you'll miss out on the vibe!) great bands playing and the beach sellers with their sarongs etcetera for sale just add to the vibe! A highlight evening and a sunset that is unreal! Go!!! 
donmalcolm,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2019,"The beaches of Bali are rightly famous for miles of fabulous white sand, surf, and beautiful young people enjoying their holiday.It is obvious by the tractors and heavy machinery parked inconspicuously here and there that a deal of effort is placed into presenting the various beaches in pristine condition each day.The warning flags provide notice to the unwary that swimming can be dangerous in places - as you would expect at a surf beach.The vendors hiring out sun loungers and surfboards seem to do a great trade, as I imagine would the wondering peddlers of beer and ice creams.So, if you‚Äôre young and into sun, surf and having a great day out, the beach is the place to be."
mariasG9650QU,17 contributions,Aug 2019,"Visited in August 2019 and went to the beach in the morning and evening. Always crowded, rubbish everywhere and sewage running into the sea. Wouldn't recommend to anyone, beaches in NZ or AUS are so much better."
lkamphuis,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2019,I‚Äôm not a fan of most Bali beaches - when you have Australian beaches it‚Äôs no comparison but I did enjoy early morning walks along the beach before it‚Äôs hot and the hustle and bustle  of Bali kicks in !Was a great way to spend the day 
Lobinqld,"Hobart, Australia",Aug 2019,Lovely place to stroll along and enjoy the sites & sounds of beach grown micro businesses.   Some great names on these places.   Enjoy the stroll & the vibe
SteveDWS,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019,Water is murky and is actually quite rough in most areas. Lack of bars and restaurant indicates it is not really for tourists. Of 3 days we visited once for 10 minutes. Ordinary. Don‚Äôt waste your time.
San P,"Moncton, Canada",Aug 2019,"Super nice day at the beach, the only downfall was getting approached all the time for renting chairs or buying goods!"
Caitlyn S,10 contributions,Aug 2019,"Nice enough, soft sand, very strong current in water and big dumping waves. In my opinion I would say not safe for swimming, but OK to paddle if you're careful."
ckrken,5 contributions,Aug 2019,"You have to visit Seminyak forget Kuta that has just gone downhill. Seminyak is the place to stay, go to Double Six beach, meet Judi, Lollipop, Ina, Tina, Jennifer, Eric, Milky, Martin and the rest of the sellers and beer boys.  Best place in the world to buy a beer and sit in comfort and watch the world go buy.  Buy your souvenirs or get your nails done even have a massage I can personally guarantee you will get a better deal and treatment from these people than any of the shops, markets or spas that you attend.  We did.  There are so many warangs to get cheap meals, it is cheaper to stay here than any place in Kuta or Legian. Kura-Kura buses run regularly and travel all over the main parts of Bali. I simply can go on and on but go and find out yourself."
Vera Z,"Beirut, Lebanon",Aug 2019,"The beach in Seminyak is amazing especially for Surfers, but not that good for swimmers since it's always high tide. The entrance is free but if you want to sit on a bed you will have to pay around 100K Rupiah per bed if you have good negotiable skills since they can ask for more."
Elenishaz,26 contributions,Aug 2019,Sunset in beautiful Seminyak never disappoint. This is my 16th Bali trip and always love looking across the ocean and watching the sunset
Denise P,"Australind, Australia",Aug 2019,Relax or get surf lessons clean beach very relaxing can get a massage or buy things Small restaurant serving local food beer and food 
Brook R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019,For one of Bali‚Äôs main beaches this is disappointing. Whereas some effort has been made to tidy it up particularly in front of the nicer hotels many people are taking their dogs for a walk and making no effort to big up their poo from the sand so not a pleasant walking experience. Also still many strays despite efforts to collar some of them. There are also a few streams emanating from the town that run across the beach with foul smelling water to paddle through. Not many people sunbathing in it which probably sums it up.
ECB,20 contributions,Aug 2019,Loved the choice of restaurants and sunsets. Beautiful beach with golden sand. Will visit soon. Very romantic. 
dotdim,"Keysborough, Australia",Aug 2019,Amazing and clean beach with great waves.  No crazy hustle here. Hotels and bars right at your fingertips.  Great spot to chill or satin or go for that brisk walk or run
anderssons,16 contributions,Aug 2019,"we moved to the south of bali to see their beaches and was dissappointed. the sewerage from the city flows directly to the beach where most of the tourist swim., we have decided to go on a bar near by and watch the sunset instead which was okay phuket thailand's beach is way more better., "
Stuart W,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2019,"The beach is vast and extends for miles with beautiful waters, lots of bars and restaurants dotted along the shoreline. Lots of surfing. Great place for watching the Balinese sunsets. "
Wang0107,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Our villa is ten minutes walks from this beach so we went there three times with kids. Compared with other very commercialised beach (Jimbaran), this beach is still having a feeling of openness, wildness and quietness. The sunset there are beautiful! "
Kenn Are M,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2019,"We found the Seminyak area to be very accommodating, as when we searched for places, spots we had no trouble finding a good place. Many bars, small shops selling Nik naks and discobars, restaurant etc. On the beach, you can buy sodas, including beer. No hard liquor though. The Pantai Seminyak is an awesome beach, allthough Bali have many of them, this one is greatly sought after by tourists."
Jonnytwosocks,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"After all id heard of Bali, its wonderful beaches, I was quite shocked - ive seen lots better. The sand was dark and littered, and the beach was over loaded with their trades people constantly annoying you. Not impressed at all... im praying Bali has better to offer. "
Tony,"Paris, France",Jul 2019,Very nice place.....not too much crowdy..lot of restos..cafes on the beach..relaxing area. Enjoy surfing practice...
sawhneyjs,"New York City, NY",Aug 2019,The Money Changers here scam you with posting high rates outside their doors. When you give them a  $100 Bill they will keep it on top of the counter and pile up the Indonesian Rupiah bills on the counter. The conversion is approximately 1.4 million and change. This they will convert in 50000 Rupiah notes which will amount to between 28 to 30 notes per $100. They will then pick up the notes to hand you the pile and will CRAFTILY PULL OUT a large chunk of the notes. The bigger the amount the easier it is for them to pull out more notes. An unsuspecting traveler will put the money in their purse or pocket and later realise that they were scammed. In our case we changed $500 and our due amount was 7.35 million. They handed us a shade over 5 million. We realised this when we arrived at the hotel. The hotel staff went with security and he immediately took the local currency back without even counting and handed us back $500. WHAT A SCAM. üò°
MOTASEMAG,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"If you want to walk around And see the city and do some shopping while at the same time eat and have a coffee in a very nice place like an open area in the street, this would be the best location"
Seema G,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2019,Clean and slightly rough sand beach.  Beach facilities are just ok kind of. We were using Marriott beach facilities. 
JVA64,"Beijing, China",Aug 2019,"Beautiful long and wide beach. Best place to watch sunset. However several open creeks discharge raw sewage into the ocean and need to be crossed by foot. Given the purchasing power on this beach, this problem should have been fixed long ago. "
Alicia S,"O'Fallon, IL",Aug 2019,"The beach was absolutely beautiful. My husband and I had an amazing time out there. The only downside, there were no public beach chairs and umbrellas provided for people visiting the beach. "
LRobinson2013,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2019,"Clean, peaceful, and relaxing.  Not a lot of people here so great for just experiencing the serenity of nature and sound of the waves."
connierideout16,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",Aug 2019,"A wonderful stretch of beach, clean and with some waves perfect to try your hand at a surfboard or body board. "
Kerrie Birch,7 contributions,Aug 2019,"It‚Äôs nice to see that they have cleaned up their act, it was so much cleaner and nicer to have that morning stroll. In the afternoon you get a lot of Balinese trying to sell you things that can be a tad annoying after a while. We managed to see a baby turtle trying to make its why back into the the ocean so that was really special. Go early and miss the crowed is my tip."
Roger-North,"Altrincham, UK",Aug 2019,"A beautiful, clean and well managed beach. Very good parking for scooters, and not fat to walk from Seminyak Square. The beach is several km long. Plenty of beach refreshments and food from a wide range of beach cafes, restaurants and bars, all well-priced and good bean-bag seats. The atmosphere moves up a notch once the sun goes down, with live bands and DJ‚Äôs given first place. Watching surfers ride the crested waves is a pleasurable way to spend an afternoon."
Mentari,"Sanur, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Seminyak beach always become must visit place in Bali, with the stunning sunset, black sand. The best time to enjoy is between 4pm to 6pm. "
Msbbel,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2019,Nothing more than a beautiful sunset at Seminyak beach! Arrive at 5.30pm latest and watch a clear view of the sun setting. Extremely vibrant vibe here along the beach with beach clubs and restaurants turning up the music. Expect a lot of people and patience to snap photos with nobody in it üòÖ
Cassandra Silvi... W,"Paris, France",Jul 2019,Nice beach to walk along and watch the waves and sunset. Close to sunset it was a bit crowded but I felt safe and comfortable. Clean sand and nice people.
Jen B,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2019,Sooooo the beach is beautiful but pretty busy. The waves are also way higher than I had thought. It was fun to jump in but only to our knees for safety reasons!
E10ne,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",Aug 2019,"Surfing and surf shops everywhere Great beach, clean and many bars and restaurants, beds available to a fair price "
SmilyBergen,"Bergen, Norway",Aug 2019,"Great sand, funny waves, lovely sunset, not too crowded. Sunbeds costs 100.000 each. Hope to be back!"
quiknett,"Springfield, MO",Sep 2018,"Seminyak is a better location then kita,  for elder people like me , prefer  Semnyak then Kuta too crowded and noisy. Seminyak has a better store  too."
Scott T,"Bangkok, Thailand",Aug 2019,The beach is fantastic. Approximately 100 meters from shore to where the beach ends. A number of beach pubs with live music in the evening.. very relaxing. The waves rolling in add that hypnotic vibe.
Jay Murray,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Beach is a must see - just be ready for the market sellers there - lovely people who are there to make a living for themselves, they go around selling their wares, be polite in saying no - other tourists there just ignore them - which I found was quite rude. A nice ‚Äòthank you - but no thanks‚Äô goes a long way."
StephanieJeffrey,"Winsford, UK",May 2019,Such a stunning beach to watch the sunset. There is a swing on the beach also which is a lovely touch. It was fairly clean and tidy. Lots of bars along the beach and chill out spots 
Timo10101,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2019,"Bali is famous for many things, however beaches and sea swimming is not the best here, unless you're a surfer. The water was cold - expected as it's an ocean, and the sea waves were quite strong and turning any swim attempt into a soft fight. "
Wulan C,17 contributions,Aug 2019,Great spot but overcrowded ..dogs roaming around..cafe s expensive went to Botanica for froze and sangria just behind the beach..
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",Jun 2019,Beautiful sunset!!! Loved watching the big waves crashing and seeing local Balinese families enjoying the beach/offering blessings. Don't miss the sunset - its magical.
holdayluv,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2019,"We went to go to the beach only to find that to get on and off the beach, if you are not staying at the beachfront resorts is a nightmare. You have to walk miles out of your way to get on and off the beach which has open drains emptying into it that smell terrible. I hated walking through the dirty water."
Ruud & Debby,"Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands",Jul 2019,"Go here if you like to enjoy the sunset while having a nice cocktail on the beach. Lots of beach bars and beach clubs to choose from. A bit more expensive then Kuta, but therefore also a bit more stylish."
CassavaHK,"Sandik, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Having been to quieter beaches this was packed and really not that nice. Way too busy, noisy and touts everywhere.  If you like the buzz, crowds then it‚Äôs the beach for you. If you like privacy and peace stay away. Sunset was nice but you can‚Äôt take a decent photo without a single person in it! "
S p,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"I'm writing this review to warn the many people that come to Seminyak beach of the very powerful currents in this part of the beach which could be deadly. Many people have died including my cousin who just drowned 3 days ago getting caught in the rip tide. He was a very good swimmer with exceptional athletic ability, but the currents on this beach are very strong and come all of a sudden. There are many articles on this if you search specifically for it,  but they get no publicity because the big corporate hotels need to keep the tourists coming in. My advice is you can stay in the hotels, but please find another beach to swim in. Please read up on rip tide currents if you do plan to stay there. The site wont allow me to post links to other sites. Thank you"
karlmonty,100 contributions,Aug 2019,Nice beach with some really good pubs / bars along the strip most of my days spent here some really good spots to have a drink an watch the sun go down üëåüëå
EveT205,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,I like this beach. Nothing much to fault but i just wish the washroom can be free and more water points to wash off our sandy feet.
Umang A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,"A other beautiful white sand beach in Bali, bear to city center and party place so sometimes may be dirty "
Razor Ray,"County Meath, Ireland",Jul 2019,Took a walk down seminyak beach with my 2 teenage boys and it was sad to see the amount of rubbish lying on the beach. There  is a stream that flows into the sea there also and it is basically a dustbin with all sorts of rubbish dumped in it which is flowing into the ocean. It is very sad and it is something the Indonesian government needs to address. Aside from that the beach is a surfers beach with huge waves. Could be so beautiful.....
Joanna L,"Davao City, Philippines",Jul 2019,"Such a striking difference from the other beaches.  Seminyak beach has a classier atmosphere, so much space, and it doesn't have the haggling vendors at Kuta beach.  The price to lounge, for food and drinks is much more here but you get what you pay for."
Guillex13,"Mendoza, Argentina",Jul 2019,"Nice beach and large so you could be in a place without others next to you.A black sand beach, big waves, if you like surf that's the location.Big and beautiful sunsets, book a place in one of the beach sand places restaurants and enjoy.For me it's a 7."
Natty,World,Jul 2019,We like Seminyak beach. Very nice beach & clean. Good for walk on the beach. You can spend time long day. Have many restaurants & Hotel. Beautiful the Sunset there...Will be back soon.üíÉüå∫Nattyüï∫üå∫Walter 
Richard S,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2019,Love going to this beach maybe because it feels like I‚Äôm home every time I go there know a lot of people and have good friendships over the years ... restaurant close by everything is busy on a Sunday afternoon 
Brindle24,17 contributions,Jul 2019,We chilled there all day and watched the sunset! Dogs running around was crazy but fun at same time! Watching the surfers is class! People trying to sell you things is super annoying sometimes. Do t by a scarf for more than 50K
Paul P,"London, Canada",Jul 2019,Fantastic sunset . Many beach front bars  and  sitting areas.  Clean for long walks  and did I mention the sunset ? Pick a spot  with your fav beverage and camera ready
thaiteadps,4 contributions,Jul 2019,Acces is easy via the parking lot as there s little access to beaches from Seminyak.Filled up with beachclubs charging high end rupiahs.we strolled further and end up in  The Rose Social which has our fav Frose & Sangria.
Ness,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2019,Gorgeous before the crowds and hawkers get there. Lots of cafes to stop for breakfast along the way and a nice breeze to keep you cool. 
blackeldo,"Kiama, Australia",Jun 2019,"‚Ä¶.This 5km section of the continuous KUTA-CANGGU beach strip rates AVERAGE by Bali mainland standards but BELOW AVERAGE by world standards‚Ä¶.You don‚Äôt come to Bali for great beaches...correction, you may come to Bali to sit on the beach in tropical conditions when it‚Äôs  freezing at home, sipping a cut price cocktail yada‚Ä¶..but the beach will not be whelming‚Ä¶. not on the mainland at least.I‚Äôm a beach blogger with over 3 million hits ‚Äì get back to BALI annually and always make a point of cycling/walking SEMINYAK ‚Äì stayed inland there a few years back. I‚Äôve visited thousands of beaches over 40 years and would not rate BALI MAINLAND‚Äôs best in my top 500. Offshore LEMBONGAN may just scrape in. IN CONTRAST gorgeous and spectacular ARTUH BEACH** (offshore NUSA PENIDA) would make my top 10. Maybe even top 3.But hey, if you seldom see a beach, you may think SEMINYAK the ants pants. As FERRIS BUELLER‚ÄôS bookie never said: ‚ÄúSure beats a sand-pit in south SPRINGFIELD‚Äù.See. what we have here is a long strip of sand where it‚Äôs easy to find a fairly deserted section - or to sit with a crowd on rather swish sun-loubge/umbrella combinations if that‚Äôs your jam. These more crowded parts are outside the bigger resorts (all sized high-end places back the beach along here) + where roads from inland (more accommodation) access the sand.There‚Äôs a gradual change heading north. South end near the big DOUBLE SIX** resort has sand similar to KUTA-LEGIAN: kinda tan-grey (rather than the gorgeous white stuff when I first visited in ‚Äò75). Heading north it darkens somewhat ‚Äì although never reaching the light black of CANGGU BCH immediately north. Most areas are quite wide but it does narrow in sections.Activity changes too ‚Äì the first 400m is a continuation of the crowded KUTA-LEGIAN scene. 3 or 4 beach bars with cushions/small tables on the sand are a real scene around sunset. Moving north it becomes quieter with gaps between crowded areas. The far north can be very uncrowded.TIPS ‚Äì those beach clubs: maybe 4 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019‚Äôs visit saw one with at least 1000 people on the sand!!!! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems high end. Dozens of all budget places within a 10 min stroll inland.- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.- wet season is not the best time to visit ‚Äì lotsa rubbish and dirty storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here (hotels/airlines offer great low season packages) ‚Äì although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).SUM UP ‚Äì an okay beach, just don‚Äôt expect WHITEHAVEN."
327andrer,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Our first visit to Bali and our first outing/sightseeing/exploring adventure started along Seminyak beach. Excellent intruduction to what could be expected of the rest of the islands very busy and touristy beach areas. Holiday vibe came through very strong. Many nice pubs and restaurants along the promonade walk. We walked for what felt like hours and never got bored or felt unintertained. You can rent a surf board just about everywhere, endless watersport possibilities etc etc etc. And then of course the sun-set, when hundreds and hundreds of people descend onto the beach. Great party vibe, sundowners and good music of any flavour. A must experience"
HonestTravelReviews,"Spalding, UK",Jul 2019,"We got a taxi from Ubud to Seminyak, as we have heard lots of good things about it. The beach is lovely and scenery is lovely but has a strict set of rules when comes to where you can and can‚Äôt swim. Most of it is where you can‚Äôt swim, it took me ages to find an area where I could purely swim and not be told I couldn‚Äôt. Me and my fianc√© got the luck of the draw with the sun beds, as we were able to separate ourselves from the crowds and only cost us 200k rph for the both of us. If you don‚Äôt like people in the way of your view, then it‚Äôs not the place for you. As you‚Äôll see crowds of people trying to get ‚Äòthe perfect‚Äô pictures for not just minutes but sometimes hours (clearly Instagrammers and photo-shoppers) and this came a bit frustrating because it made you look as if you were staring at them, even though they are in your way of the beautiful blue sea. I have heard a lot of rumours about Bali having the best sunsets in the world and I can honestly say, that is Chinese whispers, as I have seen better in the UK. "
Alen S,"Berlin, Germany",Jul 2019,Few kilometers long beach. Not so crowded. Waves are good for surfing. A lot of boards to rent. Or you can take 2 hours lessons. Sand is nice white with black patches that comes from volcanic stones.The beach is not of the cleanest but is pretty good.There is a lot of restaurants on the beach where you can chill. Prices are above average. Worth spending some days here.
Swifto,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"Living in WA where our beaches are awesome, reviewing other beaches is contextual!Large sandy beach, lots of local beach bars and options on the beach itself including surf lessons.You will get approached by sellers with everything from ‚Äúgenuine Bali Rolex‚Äù to sarongs and pedicures! but they were always good humoured and respectful with us, when bartering and even when we were not interested. You can hire a sunbed for about 100k each and often bean bags are free if you are ordering food/drink from a beach bar Beach was clean when we were there. Its mostly not surf life saving patrolled and there are signs warning of rips etc. There was often a strong swell although the beach is shallow entry  to the water - plenty of family friendly surf and access, just be mindful Great place to watch the sunset (again in context compared to WA üòÇ) or for a long beach walk on the edge of the water. (Walk from Seminyak beach through doublesix, Legion. And onwards!)"
Peter A,"Somerville, Australia",Jul 2019,Stayed at Pelangi Hotel and Spa which is right next to Seminyak beach. The beach is clean and has some good waves. There are heaps of restaurants and bars along the beach which have either undercover/outdoors  tables and chairs or outdoors lounges and beach bags. A great spot to sunbake and swim during the day. And a fantastic spot to have a cocktail and feed while watching the sunset. Loved it. 
moviegeekjn,"Phoenix, AZ",Jul 2019,"After seeing only underwhelming Sanur Beach previously, Seminyak Beach represents its polar opposite. The sunsets are fabulous and there are many entry points to this beautiful beach with fine sand; it's like I told my traveling partner: this place is like a ""poor man's Maldives.""  This area will be my primary beach area if and when I return to Bali"
Rob w,28 contributions,Jul 2019,Seminyak beach is a great place to hang out for those sundowners after a hard day‚Äôs surfing and watch the sunset with a cold beer or cocktail sitting on one of the many rainbow beanbags!
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,"loved the sunset view ,local food,vibes of the beach..surfing shots....every bit of it...clean beach but crowded....you can spend the whole day"
Deanne,"Coulsdon, UK",Jul 2019,"It‚Äôs a great beach but it‚Äôs packed from dawn to dusk with people it‚Äôs more like Costa Del Sol. There are so many nicer beaches in Bali but then Seminyak is all about clubs, restaurants, bars etc so it depends what you‚Äôre looking for. "
Ben D,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"This beach is similar to Kuta, grey sand, and strange milky creeks flowing out into the water. I would not swim in that. I didn‚Äôt particularly like walking on the sand.Seminyak is to me, a quieter version of Kuta, but with nicer shops, better food, and more relaxed locals and tourists.I love Seminyak, just don‚Äôt bother going to the beach."
Sian F,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Jul 2019,We visited Double Six area of Seminyak beach and everything was very nice. We watched the sunset one night and if you want lounge chairs you have to pay. We paid $20 for 5. There are many bars and places to eat and it wasn‚Äôt too busy. 
Georgia,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"Loads of cool we spots , lounges cost about $2.50 NZ for a day . Bean bags are free as long as you buy food and drinks . Surf lessons cost  are between $20-$30 for a hour and half lesson or $5-$10 for surfboard hire for 2 hours . Awesome music and vibes "
ADL Foodie,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"Beach is great for sunsets, waves were big, san was dirty and stray dogs everywhere. Prefer the Australian beaches! "
globalfoodie87,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"The sand lacks luster, but great to surf...you can access for free if you walk just past potato head, or go through them and order lunch then use the beanbags provided. "
louishems,1 contribution,Jul 2019,"Very clean beach that is well maintained, lots of entertainment options at night. Very busy but yet cozy, great place to relax."
Will_ashcr,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"I have been coming to Bali for a number of years. I always enjoy the ocean and the beaches, and Seminyak is one of my favourites. The beach is long, and the sea looks amazing. However, the issue of plastic pollution on the beach is really starting to get bad. Twice a day we would walk 3 or 4 km down the beach and we would pick up at least 100 plastic straws, empty water bottles, individual mint wrappers, bottle tops etc etc. I implore the local authorities to make more of an effort to keep these beaches clean and plastic free, otherwise tourism will start to decline. Nobody likes to lie on a beach coated in plastic rubbish. Employing some designated beach cleaners is the first step. In summary, it‚Äôs a beautiful beach, but it needs some urgent action to keep it that way. If you‚Äôre on the beach, and see plastic rubbish, be a good person and pick it up."
ross m,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Take earplugs for the loud music in the open bars. The Balinese have no idea when it comes to volume. Volume means quality to them, so be warned. . . "
pc-and-dc,"Hoylake, UK",Jun 2019,"I was disappointed that the sea at Seminyak beach was far too rough to swim in during our visit in June, with red flags flying for the whole week. Not ideal for small children or weak swimmers. Whilst the huge waves looked spectacular, the undercurrent was very strong and many individuals were caught unawares and pulled over by the wash of the waves. There were only a few small and not very clearly marked displays indicating the dangers of the rip tide The warungs at the back of the beach were lively in the evening and a great place to watch the sunset.The litter debris and dog dirt on the beach was not so great. Sorry, Seminyak but you have got to get on top of the beach hygiene. It is a shame that such a lovely beach is marred by this issue."
Lady Bee,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2019,Just amazing. water just great beach is extremely clean.  Very safe. wonderful sunsets.  Good for surfing in the morning huge waves
Ken L,"Northamptonshire, UK",Jul 2019,"Good beach. Sun beds and umbrellas available. The sea breeze keeps the temperature very pleasant. Not too crowded. The waves however are very high, even at a shallow depth. Not suitable for younger children.  Surprisingly few surfers."
spendinheritance,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,WE had a wonderful time here sitting on bean bags watching the sun  set having a few drinks & food so many people on the beach this was something that should be done what a wonderful way to spend the afternoon/evening. Lots of great places along the beach
Emily,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,Great beach frequented only by tourists during the day and locals in the evening. Enjoyed the end of the day with a beautiful sunset and very good cocktails.
Kiwigal2015,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"This looked like a nice beach, especially where they had groomed the sand. The area closer to the water that had not been groomed, had lots of small bits of rubbish (mainly bottle tops) on it. There was lots of sun loungers and drink/food stalls along the beach front. Several areas had ‚Äòsurfing lessons‚Äô available."
John K,6 contributions,Jul 2019,Lovely place to go straight across the small road. Visited a few times good surf waves. And seating for many.
Liv Karin,21 contributions,Jun 2019,"The beach in it self was really beautiful and a perfect place to watch the sunset, chill in the sun or take a dip in the ocean. But there were sellers constantly coming up to us which was a bit annoying. In addition, there were few facilities or other such as that. There were some sunbeds, but no showers etc. The waves was also a bit too much."
Leah C,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019,"Good spot to learn to surf.  Sand is a mix of black volcanic and silica, so looks fairly good and very little rubbish.  Lots of access points on to the beach and variety of pop-up style bars."
ed edwards,Fiji,Jun 2019,Expansive beach that has awful riptides. Lots of umbrellas and and lounge chairs. All are for hire. Swim at your hotel pools.
Finemind1st,"Seattle, WA",Jul 2019,Spent some time in the sun and people watched. Time well spent! There's tons of hotels/bars/restos to get lunch or dinner at when/if you get hungry. Enjoy!
samchy,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019,The beach in Seminyak is okay but there are plenty more that are much better. The beach is average and we only went there for a walk in the evening. There are plenty restaurants near by so a good walk and many places to eat after the walk. 
Lauren01,"Porthcawl, UK",Jun 2019,"We have spent a few days at the beach near Seminyak. The beach is clean, offers small waves for surfing and was monitored by lifeguards. "
flynniesmum,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Lovely at sundown but so many hawkers! If you can put up with trying to relax but be awoken by the locals aiming to sell then youll love it. Great bars & restaurants
Grant B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"A difficult to access beach hidden on the ""other"" side of a number of large villas and hotels.  You can reach it down a path at Ku De Ta or at Jalan Kayu Aya, just along from Motel Mexicola.  If you are of the white Kiwi or Aussie brigade take your sunscreen and pay for a sun umbrela if you intend to spend any time at the beach.I am not a surfer but the surf was quite large and to my untrained eye seemed to be what a number of doctors might order grommets and experts alike to savour.  I presume the waves arose from beach breaks, and on the day we were there we observed a number of perfect A frames."
AliciaCecilia,"Guangzhou, China",Jun 2019,"The beach is long. Connected with Kuta  and Legian and Petinget or something similar . Well is the same beach . It is not paradise at all . You can not swim only if you are a fan of surfing and beach clubs to drink and watch sunset . Of course nice for long walks.  At sunset is lively , full of local people and dogs  .... too many . No very clean . They have to clean every day with machines and full of offerings little basket with flowers . The nice touch is the colorful umbrellas and lounges  to relax ."
Edenescape S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"Relatively clean , good thunderous surf the days we visited, plenty of surf schools , people watching and beach club options . Lovely sunset ....  a loud and busy place "
DianneKamerling,"Cooroy, Australia",May 2019,"Nice beach, with some good bars/eateries along the foreshore, not much surf as such, but great for children to go swimming"
Joyce R,56 contributions,Jun 2019,Pretty beach but as Bali is it‚Äôs not an empty and relaxing beach. Nice place to catch the sunset. Not really family friendly 
Hollie_Mariee,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2019,"Lovely beach with dark sand, we sat at beach bar called Champlung which was perfect for people watching .The sea was crazy and not safe for swimming."
Barry D,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,One of the great places to watch the sunset - suggest you try Taris Bali Bar as the one of the best spots to relax and watch
Scott8446,"Glasgow, UK",Jun 2019,Went here to watch the sunset and walk to a restaurant. Beach was very busy but clean. Had lots of sand. 
Wineglass2000,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"We came here last year and came again this year - bcos of the beach. In the morning,  crashing of the waves have such a soothing and calming effect. You see families enjoying along the beach. In the evening, you see many big, colourful umbrellas lined along the beach and the whole place comes to live with people jumping into the big waves (the beach very safe and shallow - below knee depth for 50 to 80 m from shore). Beautiful sunset and nice place to people-watch trying to take the perfect Ig photos. Really an awesome place to chillax and hangout even after sunset. "
J70mcr,"London, UK",Jun 2019,Nice clean beach with amazing sunsets. Does get very busy at sunset time! People are selling sun beds for the day just make sure you sort a price out and don‚Äôt take the first piece they give you!!
Yasin H,9 contributions,Jun 2019,Very good place for evening ... Good and clean. Cleanliness can be increase.I would like to come again with my grandchildren.
Amazing Lucca,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2019,Nice & clean beach for sunrise & sunset.I'd come back to this place.I love that you can bring your fur babies.
Dee-College,"Manly, Australia",May 2019,"I have rated Seminyak beach 5 stars not because it is a beach where you would like to swim - keep that for the pool at your hotel. But it is beautiful to watch at sunset, to watch the locals playing football on Sunday, to watch the endless parade of planes landing, and for walks before the heat of the day. Good too for surfing, but not for swimming."
jennie157,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Jun 2019,"Beach was lovely and clean and the service great üòä nice clean sand area with plenty of provision of service for surfing lessons, relaxing on lounges and good prices on drinks üòä"
Nailbrush,"Cowfold, UK",Jun 2019,This beach is more for those wanting a quieter experience in Bali. A few music bars compete with acoustic sets along the beach from 5:00pm - 11:00pm but then everything winds down. It‚Äôs a shame if your night is just starting.
Martin W,"Gravesend, UK",Jun 2019,Wide sandy beach and lots of sunbeds. Music systems come out around 4pm in preparation for sunset and an evening meal on the beech or just a few beers 
Judith W,"Oakleigh, Australia",Jun 2019,Walked to beach around 10am as it was windy and the waves very beach was closed for swimming . However we hired a chair each for hour and enjoyed the passing traffic.Had a paddle to my ankles but the undercurrent was very strong.
NisheshV,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Nice beach with strong waves good for surfing. Nice restaurant by beach makes up for good vibes. Must do in Bali. Great massage place by beach
Ruslena,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2019,"Good morning exercise around the block and beach. Unfortunately, the beach is not so well kept except for areas bordering the restaurants situated on the beach. Dogs pooping on the beach are unsightly too. Apart than that, all‚Äôs well ends well."
Nemesis@666,"Doha, Qatar",Jun 2019,The sea was a bit rough but we spent a lovely afternoon there. The sand is dark. It's by some nice hotels and bars. The are no lifeguards around so be safe of you're with children. There are locals from whom you could rent a beach bed for 50000 rupiya. They'll even bring you beer or other cold drinks for a reasonable price. The sunset was beautiful! We enjoyed ourselves. 
Dhanesh Metrani,"Belgaum, India",Jun 2019,"This is a very vibrant beach at Bali, Went here in evening with my wife . The approach road to the beach is narrow , full of cars and motorcycles. Very highly recommended to visit the beach"
Ali Cappa,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,Seminyak Beach has so many great restaurants but sitting on the beach with a Bintan and watching the sunset is so tranquil.  Beaches are as clean as they can be in Bali
guptaeti,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2019,"Fun, clean, serenity.Had lots of fun making and castles with hubby & kids.No water sports we did.Indication to swim only between Flags with red & yellow stripes.Waves beyond that point were rough and risky for non swimmers. "
emilyjp,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Seminyak beach is nothing to rave about. It‚Äôs more of a surf beach, you can‚Äôt really swim in it. Lots of people just chilling and relaxing. It‚Äôs nice for a stroll or to watch the sunset on a clear day"
TJ1,"Johannesburg, South Africa",May 2019,"Looks like any other beach, not the crystal clear and blue green beaches seen in photos. Good to just chill for the afternoon where you can hire sunbeds and an umbrella. Also good walking distance from Seminyak Square and Village "
Geary W,3 contributions,May 2019,"Just returned from a amazing trip to Bali, where during our 14 day adventure we visited Ubud, Sanur, Nusa Dua and Seminyak which unfortunately was the low point of our trip. We had been to Seminyak on a previous visit to Bali and didn't have any problems but this time We fell foul of unscrupulous money changers. They used misdirection and slight of hand to scam us out of approx 1 million Rupiahs. My advice is stick to the main money changers on main roads and always double check your cash before walking away. I went back and confronted my foe's and they claimed that i had dropped the money as I walked away which of course was rubbish, I did however manage to get half of the ill gotten gains back from them when they thought i might have called the police."
PeCi,"Bratislava, Slovakia",Jun 2019,"It has all a tourist needs - little bars and restaurants, surf rentals and of course sun umbrellas & sunbeds to rent for about 150K Rp..Its not as crowded as Kuta, which we personally appreciated."
Penny L,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"We went there on both nights of our trip to chill and to relax. With the second day, we rented two beach chairs for my Boyfriend to suntan for 3hours (@ 200k rupiah). Since the main purpose of our trip was to relax, the sun sand and sea combination was heaven for us. Together with the little drinks and the stars in the sky. With the sound of waves (and of course the music) we had a really relaxing trip. And I‚Äôm missing the beach pretty badly at his moment."
Coenie K,"Riebeek-West, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Stayed in a beautiful hotel,only you realise the beach were not great.Dirty sand,plastic and cigarette buds everywhere. Come on people be proud and ≈∫"
Skhanna441,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018,"Must visit place ,especially for sun set , worth watching. Good place for couples as well as for the families."
thaibanana,manchester,May 2019,"As a keen swimmer I was slightly disappointed that the waves and surf were too strong to go swimming. The beach is large and flat, and you can walk along it for miles. There are plenty of people hiring loungers etc. We liked all the beach bars with their brightly coloured bean bags! At night the beach comes alive, with beautiful sunsets and bands/ singers at most of the beach bars. Very relaxing except for the hawkers of which there were many! Just saw a review below about effluent and can agree - upon walking northwards along the beach towards seminyak square, there was quite a fast flowing creek that stunk. Take care where you bathe I think! There were also dogs running around and on our walks we did pass the occasional dog turd. We did see people cleaning the beach and overall it was pretty clean with just a few trouble spots."
Shelley Mac,5 contributions,May 2019,The beach was relaxing with it's wide sand and good surf. Great that you can walk along the beach for miles and also call in to visit places all along the way.
MarcieBenton0186,6 contributions,Jun 2019,"We came to Bali for beach, but this one is not what we were expected when we booked our tickets to here. Grey sand, rubbish, positive side sunsets are amazing here."
MLandM,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"While walking along Seminyak beach just north of Moonlight I crossed a creek. Brown, raw, stinking effluent was pouring into the ocean right near swimmers and surfers. About 200 litres per minute. That's 10 tonnes per hour. When I asked them, the locals knew but didn't care. It was disgusting. The prevailing current carries it northwards.Be warned. Do yourself a favour, surf Double Six instead."
siongl76,4 contributions,May 2019,This beach is a nice place to chill and recommended for sunset. The sand is fine and suitable to laze around and sun bathing. However it is not recommended for swim.
GlendaNicholson0785,4 contributions,May 2019,"Great place for sunset. Get an cocktail, listen to the bands and enjoy the view. During daytime many surfers, tourists and dogs."
Sharon N,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2019,We are a bit spoilt coming from Australia but it was a nice beach.  Liked the relaxed beach at night. Sit have a drink listen to a band. 
sanjaya,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2019,Try go to this place at sunset and you will be amazed. We have a great time in here.  But will find some other beaches
Ipfreely84,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2019,"One of the best tattoo studios I have been to , absolutely amazing and kind people with absolute outstanding talent , I would highly recommend anyone wanting or looking at having a tattoo done to have it at their shop"
Tya A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2019,"Was here more than 3 times this week. I came here to see Sunsets. There are lots of other people from surfing, football to relax by sitting by the beach. The beach is clean. There are many people bring their dogs here for afternoon walk"
orientdesign,wateringen,May 2019,"in the center of Seminyak and enjoy the sunset on a beautiful beach. It can be super crowded but very cozy. Keep your attention, because if you order a cocktail during the rush, it may be that there is almost no alcohol in it. It happened to us in any case."
Loislovestravelling,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"It is good to visit..... but just the once. To be honest, unless you want to sit and drink, there isn‚Äôt much more to do. "
mkaes,"Luzon, Philippines",Nov 2018,"Great place to watch the sunset, resto bars are here and there, make sure you choose the best spot with great drinks menu and live music, bring your tripod to capture the timelapse of the sunset, make sure you bring enough money as the drinks are pricey! "
Deetee100,"London, UK",May 2019,"This coastline on the western side of Bali, starting from Kuta, through Legian to Seminyak is very heavily commercialised, so the beach is lined with hotels and bars and, although kept relatively clean, is still far from somewhere to relax. There are surf schools along the entire length, then people trying to sell you everything from coconuts to sarongs and hats. You‚Äòll have to venture further away from Denpassar to escape the crowds."
FamilyWillow,173 contributions,May 2019,As usual there were numerous dogs defacating on the beach. It's strewn with rubbish and there is a large drain flowing with poluted water.Don't let the photos cool you.
Erwin,"Ede, The Netherlands",May 2019,During sunset and after sunset on this beach the bars have live music and often 'happy hour' cocktails. Easy to have a few great nights.
MishyTravels,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"This beach is great for keeping active, with flat firm sand perfect for walking, jogging or running.The beach is clean and scraped every morning.There are a few friendly dogs but the area comes alive at night with movies or live music, fairy lights, cocktails and food a plenty.Perfect for singles, couples or families"
Frank G,"West Pennant Hills, Australia",Apr 2019,There is no way I will ever go back to this beach.  It is the filthiest piece of ocean and sand I have ever seen  Authorities really need to clean this up. No thank you.
NIC D,France,May 2019,"nice to go into the sea or walk in the morning or go at the end of the afternoon , to sit on pouf  for the sunset , looking for the "" green ray""( le raon vert;;;¬∞"
Herdiana Surachman,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2019,"When in Bali, me with friends always come to Petitenget Beach to enjoy the beach while waiting for sunset.Different with Kuta where on the bach so many locals sunbed, and in Double Six where so many beach bar.In Petitenget's Seminyak beach you can take your own beach towel and have your own time. Of course, there's still locals try to sell products or food, but it's because Petitenget is public beach but sometime is clearer than the two (Kuta & Double Six)"
Mariatynan,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2019,The beach was clean this time of year. Lots of restaurants where we go. Champlung is our favourite. Balinese are all pleasant.
Matthew D,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Apr 2019,"OK maybe I‚Äôm spoiled a bit by living in sight of a great beach and holidays in the Pacific Islands but I don‚Äôt particularly rate this one. Long sandy beach, not too crowded, some nice beachside bars and restaurants. The surfing is OK (again, spoiled by Hawai‚Äôi and Aotearoa) but not great. Absence of lifeguards and presence of undertow make swimming an issue. Some rubbish- not as bad as Phuket, worse than the Pacific. An oil slick present while we were there. As beaches go, if you‚Äôre looking for a long walk on a beach ((with a reasonable number of people there but not crowded or noisy) with some places to get a beer or some decent food at reasonable prices you won‚Äôt go wrong with this. But it‚Äôs not spectacular and lack of swimming or natural shade that you don‚Äôt have to pay for are an issue. "
badhabbits05,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,"Nice and relaxing sunset drinks you will get hassled by locals selling kites, bracelets and all other items"
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,The beach in Seminyak is not as wide as in other areas of Bali but it is fairly clean and also perfect for a stroll. Compared to Kuta it is also cleaner. Not many people are in the water though.The best part are the sunsets which are simply stunning viewed from Seminyak. Best is to go to one of the beach clubs and enjoy the view from there.
BigMac666,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,Nice beach great for watching the sun set and to people watch. Very big surf comes in here also. Cold Bintangs from 20000IDR!
Ziggy N,"Nanaimo, Canada",May 2019,"The beach we accessed  in behind Discovery Mall. It goes for a long ways.  There are many vendors selling beverages and snacks tucked under the trees for shade. And of course the mall food court.  We had a wonderfully prepared Japanese meal. 2nd floor, other end of mall.  Over looks the street, Opposite KFC  The beach itself is not spotless. I have also seen much worse.  But if you going to be letting kids run around be sure to inspect as best you can for sharp items. There are designated areas for you to enter water.  Mind the yellow and read markers. There were very few people on this beach because it was so hot. Possibly on another day it would of been different.  This day was over 40 degrees and not a cloud in the sky"
Linda D,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,Great place to watch the sunset with your special friend.  Can sometimes be crowded during peak holiday periods. In the same vicinity of the beach are a couple of markets and really nice coffee shops. 
tryasanisca,2 contributions,Apr 2019,"My hotel was near the beach, so I went there and have a coconut to enjoy the sunset. It was fun so many people surfing and enjoy their time"
shirishnv,"Bengaluru, India",May 2019,"Our family of 4 stayed a week in April, just 10 mins walk from Seminyak Beach & visited it regularly. The beach is nice with beach restaurants playing 80‚Äôs music with plenty of beach chairs interspersed with 5 star hotels.  The beach itself was nice & empty as most of the tourists are on the beach chairs. It was really nice to walk on the beach in the early mornings & evenings too to watch the sunset or even to swim in the waves. The sand itself had a blackish hue with fine sand. The famous beach shack La Plancha is on this beach. "
Robyn W,"Fontana, CA",Apr 2019,"Seminyak is not a pretty beach, its dirty.Wild and stray dogs roam and bark at you. There is trash. Definitely not the highlight of my Bali trip. "
Amr77,"Alexandria, Egypt",May 2019,"The beach is huge. Shallow water, nice sand, strong waves. It‚Äôs a perfect beach for surfing & learning how to surf. There are a lot of places that teach you how to start surfing."
jjbaby1,"Buderim, Australia",Aug 2017,"Worth a visit, definitely a tourist destination. Black sand and great surf. Beach filled with locals selling their goods and sun beds"
cavanabroad,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,Would not be back here. The sand is horrible to walk in. Spent about 20 mins here and left. Dog feaces all over the sand. Very bad smell of local waste
Ramsfan158,"Derby, UK",May 2019,"Beach covered in litter, litter in the water too, overpriced sun beds, hawkers.... try somewhere else"
Krossprocess,"Rowville, Australia",May 2019,Literally full of commercial rubbish! The live music venues at night are the only reason to visit this beach mainly because the beach gets raked and the rubbish is hidden in the dark. 
Paul in Frankfurt,"Frankfurt, Germany",May 2019,Pleasant but ... not my favorite... there‚Äôs open sewage and a fair amount of trash that washes up on the beach from god knows where? all sorts of PLASTIC trash is around and incredibly sad to witness. Why isn‚Äôt Bali aggressively working on picking up trash from its once pristine beaches? Non biodegradable PLASTIC shouldn‚Äôt just sit on the beach - it‚Äôs dirty and harmful to the environment. This is what happens when they‚Äôve got 5 million visitors per year ... 
Ryan B,"Camps Bay, South Africa",Apr 2019,"When we went to visit my wife and i werent overly impressed. The beach had quite a bit of rubbish on it, the water was very murky and churned up from the big waves and it just didnt compare to other beaches i have been to around the world."
higgos@gmail.com,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2019,"Seminyak is that little bit quieter than Legian and definitely quieter than Kuta. Mostly high-end resorts so not a lot happening on the beachfront. Most of the resorts have restaurants/bars open to the public, including the excellent The Samaya, so it's well worth a drink or a meal looking over Seminyak Beach. Ok for surfing but the banks never quite form properly so it's hard to find a consistent peak. The quality of the water is hit and miss, use your sense. If it's been raining a lot and there's a lot of storm-water run-off or, (especially) you can see plastic bags, etc. in the water then stay out pf the water for a few days."
ExcitedTraveller1973,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Apr 2019,On our visits to Seminyak beach it was just out from our hotel - Royal Beach by MGallery. It was kept clean and the guys out front selling bintang and soft drinks were all good. Not as many hawkers selling items as other parts of the beach which has its good points!
Maria B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"We are not surfers, but real beach lovers - we would never consider sunbathing on this beach. The sea is quite rough, the beach itself is not very clean. Watching the sunset is the only reason to visit Seminyak beach in my opinion."
Sunshine307,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2019,Seminyak Beach is still one of the cleanest along here.Lots of beautiful cafes and restaurants to relax in and watch the waves or catch a breathtaking sunset while sipping on s cocktail. The beach is cleaned daily here so it is great to have a swim without all the litterüëç
nxtxpxk,"Pattaya, Thailand",Apr 2019,The beach mainly attracts surfers. There are beach chairs everywhere where you can sit and grab some drinks from beach bars. Garbage can be seen in general.
JamesCowcher,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Go running, go for a swim , lie on the beach or drink beer at sunset. It‚Äôs all good. I was staying in the hotel indigo which has direct beach access and beach views from the hotel. I would recommend Seminyak over other beaches."
Astri F,6 contributions,Apr 2019,"I admire sunset in Seminyak Beach. This beach is not a quiet place to enjoy sunset while reading a book, but to catch a beautiful sunset? This is one of the must visit place.I love to see the wave and it sounds so calming. They provide many bean bag there, so you can choose any spot to catch the sunset. For some cafe they need you to make reservation before you come to get the best spot. But overall it was a great sunset.So, go catch your sunset in Seminyak Beach and enjoy the moment there."
1teaspoonlove¬Æ,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2018,Seminyak beach is definitely better then kuta Beach.It's closest if you are around seminyak.This beach is good for surfing for Children and people who are learning.Equipments are available there.Lots of good and beverage stalls around.
naziha m,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Apr 2019,I have seen many sunsets in my lifetime. But the ones I experienced on Seminyak Beach near The Champlung was simply breathtaking. How beautiful is His Creation.
ccteix2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Good because is a good area to stay in hotels ., but it has many bars and restaurants so, many people ... not clean enough but ok. "
Aldona D,Bemtota,Apr 2019,Beautiful beach with the big waves and gold sand. Waves are really very big and it is nice to observe them. People are surfing all the time and have a great fun doing it.It is also possible to have massage on the beach and drink fresh coconut.
merlin03,"Kenilworth, UK",Apr 2019,"The beach is too dangerous to swim in with currents being strong and it being red flagged as dangerous and life guards whistling you out.Raw sewage is pumped into the sea right next to the hotels Massive problem with rubbish, plastic bags and plastic bottles "
Wander265191,"Ubud, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Great for surfing but a little too strong for us to go further than paddle. Keep an eye on children! The tide can wash up a load of rubbish ‚òπÔ∏è but it is soon cleared up.
sudershan s,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Apr 2019,"This is a beautiful beach as good as beaches are. White sands lined with kiosks of seafood are inviting. The view of sunset is superb and a leisurely stroll along the beach is relaxing. I could not go into the water as it was full tide and I am afraid of being drowned. All the beaches are more or less, the same."
Ellen Brandt,"Chicago, IL",Apr 2019,"This is a great beach for adults, but it was a little crowded for us to take the kids, as we had some difficulty to keep an eye on them. You can buy delicious fruits and drinks from people on the beach, which is great way to cool off in the heat."
Argy39,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2019,We walked along here every morning on our recent stay and must say the beach is much cleaner now than it was 12 months ago and a real credit to the locals who make this happen.Lots happening on the beach with many bars and lounges available to have a drink. It can get a bit dangerous in the surf depending on how big it is. Not advised for poor swimmers.
Haldun D,"Istanbul Province, Turkey",Mar 2019,There is particulary very good place evening time . Getting snacks with beer and attending beatiful sunset. Due to tide more space at the beach.. 
Sharon D,7 contributions,Apr 2019,Beautiful beach. Walking with music playing. Had a swing on big swing. Easy walking. Cafes faced beach easy assess. 
Marion S,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Apr 2019,Excellent selection. All food ordered by our party of 8 was really delicious. Great cocktails. Good service. Will go again !!!!
Liane Chacra,21 contributions,Apr 2019,"This beach is fabulous as it is really the extension of Kuta beach and goes on for miles.  It is perfect to walking, but could be a bit of a challenge for swimming, as it is the place for surfing beginners.  This means that the waves arrive High and strong and that the beach is fairly flat which makes it safe for surfing.  If you would like to swim it may be a challenge as it is quite shallow and once you get past the waves, without a board you may be pulled under....not sure it did not try, but loved the walking, preferred to swim in our pool instead."
Okan T,3 contributions,Apr 2019,"I came here for surfing only and as such can only give a review based on that experience. However for the purposes stated above the Seminyak beach was great. A lot of white waves to take, though the currents can be strong. Great sandy beach. No annoying rocks. "
Marcus J,46 contributions,Apr 2019,Nice beach.  Short stroll from hotel. Nice views great vibes and atmosphere relaxing  with a. Cold beer 
FiverACT,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2019,"Not  bad beach, less busy than some of the Kuta and Legian beaches, and to us it was a more relaxed pace of visitor here too.A few of the reviews I've read spoke about the sand quality being better here? We didn't really notice that to be honest. I think we are spoilt with much better sand in Aus, but overall these are pretty great beaches."
Shanta,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2019,Less congested with better sand quality compared to Kuta n Legian which sit on the same stretch. The district itself is more relaxed n fun for food n shopping compared to the chaotic n very commercialised Kuta. 
Alexandra T,"Wollongong, Australia",Apr 2019,"This is my first visit to Bali and we are staying in Nusa Dua so we decided to venture out a bit and have a look at Seminyak- went to go for a walk on the beach and it‚Äôs definitely not the nicest beach to walk onTonnes of garbage everywhere! I don‚Äôt know how people could enjoy it, it makes me sad to see litter on the beach so I couldn‚Äôt stand it The amount of hotels along the beach, someone needs to take initiative and employ staff to keep the beach clean Definitely won‚Äôt be back for a swim at that beach "
NAC88,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,"I will not be going back to Seminyak again, the beach has been totally destroyed. It is covered in plastic trash and filth, which seems to pile up faster than the hotel workers can scoop it up. More concerning is the fact that the run off from the creek that flows into the Indian Ocean at the Pettitenget temple has basically turned into a sewage channel, with thousands of recently built villas discharging untreated sewage directly into the creek. It was raining off and on while I was there, and the ocean was brown and foamy with filth from the run off, and the beach smelly and gross. I was travelling with a few other families, and almost every single kid that went into the ocean got sick, several of them seriously enough to end up at the Bali clinic to get anti-biotics. One kid that was playing in the surf apparently got the brown water in his mouth and was vomiting for 2 days straight. I understand that the water is cleaner down by Double 6 beach and definitely up by Canggu, but frankly, until the local authorities get their act together and start cleaning up the water, I am not going back there for a beach holiday. Seminyak is a good place to go if you want to party in the bars, go shopping, go out to the many really cool restaurants and clubs in the area as long as you can tolerate long periods of time stuck in traffic. It is absolutely the wrong place to go if you want to go to the beach."
micheychris,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2019,"Our hotel was just 10 min walk down to Seminyak Beach.  Minus the vendors trying to sell you items, it‚Äôs a lovely walk/swim along the beach.  There are day beds you can hire.  A line of restaurants both casual and formal for a great view of the sunset.  The beach was clean."
Jim W,"Guam, Mariana Islands",Apr 2019,Waves are a bit rough for swimming but perfect for surfing and the Long Beach run  was absolute perfection.  But...the best part....the sunset.  Get a beach side table for dinner and enjoy the sunset over what I think is a top 10 beach in the world!  
Sashnson,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2019,"Amazing, great vibe, music on the beach, bean bags, great smells, awesome calm crowd. A great place to be at sunset. Eats, drinks and great chill out place."
Rbnwdln,Minnesota,Feb 2019,"We stayed at a beautiful resort in Seminyak and although the resort was fantastic, the beach and sea were quite dirty. The sand was grey with chunks of plastic and other debris. The water was also full of trash. Very disappointing to travel so far and find the beach in such condition.üòî"
SClemens,"Livermore, CA",Apr 2019,Great beach at Double 6. Nice cafe and friendly people. We used the local surf school / board rental which was very fair. My wife like Seminyak over Samir.
Judy A,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2019,"Recently stayed at Double-Six Hotel and was able to see the daily early morning cleaning of the beach by tractor. Great beach for walking, scenic, lots of activity and some great beach restaurants and bars with bean bags to relax in and enjoy the music in the evenings. "
suzannecotton2711,"Leeds, UK",Mar 2019,sea can be a bit rough with large waves and a strong pull  good for surfing   the sea is really warm and clean . beach gets busy on night for the sun set but it is worth seeing.  plenty of bars and seating 
TKSG88,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2019,"Nice clean sand with nice sunset , nothing much to complain about , the corn being sold on the beach taste so good too "
Grace B,4 contributions,Mar 2019,do not buy and drink the cocktails as the will make u very sick.Its Bali moonshine they use.. it smells like fuel They told me its made from coconuts... no its not.It can be dangerous if ur on medication.The restaurants also offer these cocktails.Stay away from them. 
Anupam S,"Shimla, India",Mar 2019,This beach is a good place for strolling. Neat and clean beach. The weather was good in March when we visited there.overall a nice place for peaceful strolling.
asim_chakrabarti,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2019,"Excellent and clean beach..Surfing,  kiting and playing football with local inhabitants will add on extra mileage. "
Cbak748,"Brighton, Australia",Mar 2019,"The beach has brown sand and each morning there is brown scum in the waves and water and I was told it was rubbish. After a downpour of rain the water was littered with rubbish, plastic and other matter. It was awful and wrapped around your legs. I would not swim in it. At night The beach comes alive with beanbags and umbrellas with lights and music, which is very colourful, and turns into bars selling cocktails and beer and watch the sunset. Very pleasant."
cesaralonsogs,"Austin, TX",Mar 2019,"We spent most of our stay in Sanur, but we decided to spend one day in Seminyak. Overall, the beach seem to have a longer sand area than in Sanur with less algae. However, the water in Seminyak was not as calm as in Sanur making it more appropriate for surfing than for swimming. Also, Seminyak was not as peaceful as Sanur. It was definitely worth it to check it out though. "
Christine L,Waikanae,Oct 2018,I've seen a few reviews where the shore has been described as dirty but I found it fine when visiting in October 2018............the sunsets were beautiful - nice long walk along the beach a few days - could stop and hire a lounger for next to nothing along with bottled water if needed.    Crowded at sunset along Kuta area but in Seminyak there were less people.
Aaqarsh Aiyyar,"Chennai (Madras), India",Mar 2019,"Though the shores were dirty, the water was clean. I loved watching the sunset at this beach. The beach was crowded and there were quite a few shops and vendors who were busy taking care of their business. "
The travelling PUNter,"London, UK",Mar 2019,Not what I expected when coming to one of Bali‚Äôs nicest beaches - lots of rubbish and people not a very serene place...
SabrinaCCSP,"Makati, Metro Manila, Luzon",Nov 2018,"locals should be responsible in cleaning the area not just taking care of their business, but also taking care of our nature which help them to earn money for living also tourist need to learn how respect the place and not just throw your trash anywhere. be responsible traveler guys."
pjacw,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"Although this beach is nicer than the beach in Kuta which has litter everywhere, it's hardly clean and I definitely wouldn't describe it as a beautiful beach with white sand as it is often advertised. The water is quite shallow and the beach is wider than many. I wouldn't stay in Seminyak if I was after a beach holiday, but it's ok for a day maybe. Uluwatu is a better place to stay if you want a nice beach holiday."
Lucifer,34 contributions,Jul 2018,"Went to the beach late afternoon for drink and to watch the sunset,very busy lots of people and vendors selling scarves necklaces etc. Nice atmosphere but was told not to order any cocktails as several people had previously encountered stomach problems as a result.Beer soft drinks anything with a screw cap I thought would be fine and so it was.Would recommend it."
leanneandtony,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2019,The beach is fine. The further north u head the less hawkers and people on the beach. There are still chairs and umbrellas to hire and cheap beers to buy
Yagneshchandan,"Pune, India",Feb 2019,Seminyak beach is not much crowded. Its a clean beach where you can relax and also play in water. Good resorts and hotels nearby to stay.
nealeconnor,"Wokingham, UK",Mar 2019,Stunning beach.  Sea was lovely and warm and quite shallow in places which was ideal  for my wife . You don‚Äôt get pestered much by locals trying to sell you stuff and plenty of beach bars for food and drink .
Emvestment,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2019,"This is the place where to start surfing. Suitable Wave (not big not small). The feeling when you stand on the surf also on the surface of the wave, is amazing. RECOMMEND :1. You can find the Surf Lesson at the beach (Cheaper but only teacher no Photographers) or the Professional Surf School with teacher and photographers) by internet (school is near the beach by 10-15 min walk.2. For beginner, the more big board the more easy to stand.  "
dans8448,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"When coming here we weren‚Äôt expecting this beach to be the most stunning in the world but what we did find shocked us! Although the beach is big, with lovely dark sand and big waves it is in desperate need of some environmental action! The plastic and rubbish towards the top of this beach is quite shocking and sad to see! It is clear from visiting Bali that over population and the massive tourist numbers are having a huge impact on the environment here, and it isn‚Äôt hidden away. On the plus, the beach has an abundance of cafes and bars if your looking for lunch or a drink, and it‚Äôs a good beach for a long stroll. The sunsets here are very pretty too. Not for me and I really hope the Indonesian government starts paying attention to their pollution problems!"
Tani M,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2019,"I havent gone for swimming there, but have gone for a walk, sat in one of the many beach side cafes andenjoued a drink along with music and sunset. It will be an enjoyable evening. There will be sellers coming up to you, just say no thank you firmly if you dont wanna buy."
Steven C,Eugene,Feb 2019,"Lots going on, many facilities for food, drinks, and activities. Easy to stroll most areas with some quiet spots and some very active. A great mix."
thomas blaire,"Spain, El Centenillo, Spain",Jan 2019,"we visited this place when sunset time, sunset looks really good from this beach, the beach is also clean, hope to visit this place again"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Mar 2019,"Typical Bali beach really , can get rough and you need to watch the tides for reps etc.Always plenty of activity happening along with plenty of bars and restaurants."
Wayne L,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2019,"Our hotel faced the beach in Seminyak, the beach can be walked on for many ks either way , i e from the airport beach to Changu and looks like one is in paradise.Sand is black , a change to what most of us are used to , surf is spectacular , but dangerous to the inexperienced swimmers.Unfortunately like most beaches in Bali , there is a massive problem with litter and rubbish , the main culprit being plastic of all descriptions , both in the water and on the beach.We encourage people visiting the beach to bring back a plastic bag full of rubbish each time they visit to not only assist with the litter problem , but also to encouragr locals to clean their beaches for themselves and the environment (N B we are not Greenies )"
paulraw12,"London, UK",Feb 2019,"Safe, lovely and with water that is a pleasure to go in to.You can surf though the waves were quiet when we were therePeople are always cleaning up rubbish"

Kumar E,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"Beautiful beach to watch the sunset and chill out. You will fins many restaurants, and along the beach side. I enjoyed sipping a cocktail and watching the sun goes down. So relaxing."
Caroline H,"Alstonville, Australia",Mar 2019,üòé.....was a nice place to see üèñPreferred my private pool and less tourists to be honest üòäüòéüòçQuiet time was all I was in need of for this trip away ‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫‚ò∫
Craig F,16 contributions,Feb 2019,"I understand February is offseason in Bali, however, the weather was nice, surf was up, not too many people on the beach or in the water.  Always lots of available sun lounges with umbrellas.  Only complaint is the very gradual slope of the beach, so you have to go WAY out to be in water above waist level.  Actually, one other complaint and its a big one, the people coming up to you every 5 minutes trying to sell you something.  Just want to close my eyes and chill, right?  Very annoying. Oh yeah, one more thing...walked to the beach from Potato Head and on the way walked through a river of sewer water flowing into the ocean.  Yuk.   But don't think that's super close to the public beach, was hard to tell at night.  Anyway, also have fresh coconut water for sale and showers for use for a small fee.  Great beach overall"
Bas F,"Roosendaal, The Netherlands",Mar 2019,It is a beautifull beach with nice sands and relatively calm des. Many possibillities to enjoy a longer stay here.Drinks and bites available.
Rodney M,"St Peters, Australia",Feb 2019,"The beach is always fun to walk along , I find it best early in the morning or later in the afternoon as it does get very hot .It‚Äôs a surf beach so be prepared for some strong waves or currents and swim where the flags are.There is many spots you can hire chairs or just stop for a cool drink , there are a lot of  Balinese selling sarongs jewellery etc but if you take the time talk to them they do have interesting stories to share .You also are able to grab a massage along the beach and there is no shortage of food . I find the best way to walk down to Legion or Kuta as it does not seem as far compared to walking the main streets.When the tide is out there is some rubbish that you will see and the locals try to clean the beach up as much as possible ."
VWDest,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Feb 2019,"Seminyak beach is a okey beach with a lot of nice restaurants and surfing spots and companies renting you surfing gear, but the beach feels a bit dirty..Not so much the beach actually more the plastic coming up on shore..Everyday I cleaned plastic coming up from the ocean.It‚Äôs so sad what we the human race are doing to our planet."
Olga K,"Moscow, Russia",Feb 2019,"Hello everyone!I want to tell you about Seminyak beach and places I visited near this beach.First of all , Seminyak beach is one of the cleanest beaches but it is not possible to swim there because of waves. For swimminf I like Karma beach or Melasti beach next to Karma. On the Seminyak you can go to Potato Beach Club and have fun there all day from 10am to 1am. Deposit is 1 million for bed. Maximum 6 persons. You can get drinks and food for these money. At night I went to ""Mirror"" night club and ""La Favela"". i liked them and I really had fun there. Night clubs normally close at 3pm there.Enjoy your holidays!Yours Olga Korneva ;)"
Int_Academic,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2019,I've visited the beach many times. The first time I saw masses of plastic particles on the tide line where you might expect to see shells and seaweed.This time perhaps because it coincided with Chinese New Year the beach seemed pristine.  It was clear that this was due to a concerted effort to rake and collect the plastic. Full marks hotels / council i cant express how important this aspect is to visitors. And thank you for the beautification of the roadside with plants. It has made a massive difference.
Jonas W,"Stockholm, Sweden",Mar 2019,"Beach is unfortunately not so nice anymore, lots of plastic and stuff. Surfing is ok still, but the beach is not for swimming due to waves and currents. Beach side hotels and restaurants are not especially nice either; more pricey the just a block above and the value for the extra sea view is overrated. Better beaches just north of.We had one stop there and never went back. "
Aj92,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"Very average beach, thank goodness i don't see much rubbish after i heard there was a ban for single use plastic. It's nice to see the sunset there if you like walks on the beach and have some cocktails in the bars there. Watch out for some dogs that poop in some parts of the beach. Other than that it's good to go early in the morning there as well. If you are going by a motorcycle or car there is parking fee which is about 500 rp."
chrisCullercots,cullercots,Feb 2019,"Really got a shock when visited the beach. Dirty, packs of dogs and sh..... all over the beach, plastic, rubbish, brown sea with rubbish off the plastic, beach bars expensive."
Sunshine619277,"North Shields, Australia",Feb 2019,"Book a restaurant overlooking the beach at sunset... beautiful Italian food at La Lucciola - gentleman need a t shirt, no singlets allowed even nice ones..."
Alex V,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Feb 2019,Great place for sunset view and drink in the beachbars. The beach also good for the middle range surfers.
palanivelan,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Feb 2019,"Not much impressed with this beach, very average and some those in Vietnam or Malaysia definitely will be better choice"
Lynette F,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2018,"A national tragedy to see the mountains of rubbish washing up on to this iconic beach, as tourists lounged on rented beach chairs. What a mess. At each of the big beachfront venues, workers were hopelessly attempting to clear away the relentless pollution. On 25 Dec 2018 the Mayor announced he was banning single use plastics - they are thrown in to rivers by villagers then washed into the ocean during the rainy seasons. "
flipper0211,"Miami Shores, FL",Feb 2019,"The beach area is spacious, theres plenty of restaurant and food stalls along the walkway. The sand is soft and the water was clean. Plenty of good waves for a surfer to enjoy. Good place to spend a few hours."
Eunyoung C,"Seoul, South Korea",Feb 2019,I went to Seminyark beach to see a Sunset. The Sunset was so beautiful and fantastic.I stayed on the beach for four hours.It was an atmosphere of calm and restifulnes.
Aura_Bold,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Very beautiful when the sun goes down. We really enjoy relaxing time on the beach while jogging in the afternoon.
Pepper,"Seattle, WA",Feb 2019,"Huge Beach at low tide. Great for walking. Lots of nightlife but also some easy, quiet areas.  Great places to eat all along the way. Some good beach restaurants - high romance - but some of the places have blaring music. "
shreyashrivastav27,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Feb 2019,"It‚Äôs a beautiful beach with some great food options around it. Potato beach house club, woo bar, sky garden. Upscale boutiques and restaurants. Semniyak beach is good for relaxing, swimming and enjoy good night life "
lorra209,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"We visited a few different beaches during our stay in Bali and were very upset and the amount of rubbish and debris lying around. We took a cab to Seminyak Beach and could immediately see a huge difference from the other beaches. We could tell that a tractor had been over the beach before our arrival. There was the usual umbrella and deck chair crews at the beach and we were able negotiate down from the 200000 IDR quoted to 150000 IDR. The beach was not very crowded. There were the usual peddlers walking up and down the beach and for the most part were respectful if you decided not to purchase. A few were a bit more zealous than the others, but overall a simple no thanks was usually enough. The thing that impressed me the most was at the high tide time, the umbrella traders and their crews came down to the water's edge and raked and removed any rubbish on the beach and then took it away and placed it in a bin. (We had seen a crew on another beach, rake up the beach but then just dig an hole and bury it). It took them only about 10 minutes and small crews were doing it all the way up the beach. The restaurants in the area were a little more expensive than other areas, but still good value in comparison to aussie prices."
David M,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"Such potential for this to be an amazing beach. Instead it‚Äôs full of trash, looked abandoned and neglected. It‚Äôs strange that the hotels and resorts along the shore don‚Äôt cash in on, and look after the beach in front of them. "
Saurav M,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2019,"Just dirty, plain and simple. Sad beach! Nothing more to say, dogs and their owners roaming around, stupid pictures and no shacks! All high end beach restaurants ready to rob u! "
Gibbo1969,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2019,"First time in Seminyak and had high expectations. To be honest we were disappointed, beachfront is dominated by big resorts so there is no beach walk as such . Town has a lot of paddy fields in it so the mozzies were off the charts .Usual mix of good, bad and ugly places to eat but didn‚Äôt love it and will go back to sanur next time"
Adrianfgs,"Shanghai Region, China",Feb 2019,"Seminyak beach is beautiful and the views, especially at sunset, are delightful. However, it‚Äôs best just to admire the views rather than venture into the water, as the sea is littered with rubbish/garbage, which is a massive disappointment! "
Jay S,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2019,"Yes plastics and pollution is an issue. We all know that. We all make our own choices. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this beach. Long and wide, not overly crowded. Didn‚Äôt see much pollution. Enjoyed the sights and sounds. I‚Äôd say this is a must check out"
Jackie A,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,Not suited for swimming due to amount of debris that washes up. Maybe due to time of year. Lovely restaurants along the beachfront area though for sunset if able to overlook the debris
ekapryadi,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,at seminyak beach you can seeing sunset for free or you can drink at la planca once of most pupular cafe in front the beach..
lgcnz123,9 contributions,Feb 2019,"Very beautiful beach amazing bars to sit down and relax at such a great experience. Only downside is the poo, condoms and rubbish that lines the beach where water meets the sand."
Fil Magnoli,4 contributions,Feb 2019,"The local authorities need to do a better job at cleaning up the beach. The water is warm, the beaches are groomed by tractors every morning, but the amount of plastic waste washing up is ongoing. Local beach businesses, wether it‚Äôs chair/umbrella, surf lessons or other Independant rental operators do their best to pitch in throughout the day, but it‚Äôs a bigger problem that needs a relook at how we as a society treat and use products. Good on Bali for eliminating plastic bags from many shops this year, hopefully it has a positive impact on what would otherwise be a lovely day out to the beach."
rene z,"Tamarindo, Costa Rica",Feb 2019,We went for a beach walk at 6:30am and the amount of garbage on the beach was appalling. Cleaning crews were working but it‚Äôs sad to see so much plastic and other types of garbage on the beach. With so much income crom tourism the Balinese government ought to invest in educating people about littering...
T D N,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"This beach is quaint and simple (and a little bit stinky). Don‚Äôt expect much and you‚Äôll enjoy it. It‚Äôs a beautiful walk to La Plancha or similar, yet it‚Äôs so heartbreakingly covered in rubbish and debris. "
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"Hotels offering Western style comfort, restaurants with a bit of everything, disco's with loud bass sounds and amplifiers on the beach (hard rock, hiphop, disco, Beatles and Stones from the 1960s). Lots of cold beer. Not to mention vendors and other local service providers. Great for watching sunsets and having a party.Quite unique are the big waves, but they also carry a lot of rubbish to the beach. A result of a poor waste collection system on the island and of course large industries that wrap their goods in plastic. 80% of the garbage on Seminyak beach comes from rivers that wash it down into the ocean. Especially during the rainy season it is a big problem."
Kyla L,11 contributions,Feb 2019,"An average looking beach that is made to look much worse because of all the garbage washed ashore. They going rate for sun chairs seems to be 200K for two people, which is way more than other places and you don‚Äôt even get access to food or toilets! Would never come back. "
TheMoni17,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,It is a nice soft white sand beach with many restaurants and shacks lined up on the edges. We went there for a stroll with our footwears in our hands but had to be very careful while walking as there was too much waste & garbage being thrown at this beach. I think Bali government should limit the commercialisation here and make strict rules for the vendors and sellers to ensure that their customers do not litter. And should also impose fine on the people/visitors who litter. 
Ferry A,"San Mateo, Philippines",Feb 2019,We went there for dinner. Relaxing and colorful bean chairs all over. Went to a resto with live singers. Friendly staff. We loved their pizza and chicken wings. A variety of drinks too. 
janetlim18,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jul 2018,"Nice beach, worth to go. Will go again. Was great for time lapse video and beach walk. Enjoyed my time there with sunset. "
HayleyPresling,"Wellington, New Zealand",Feb 2019,Beautiful setting on Bali‚Äôs coastline. But sadly there is a lot of rubbish left behind which impacts the beauty. Be weary of the people trying to give you cards for timeshares and trying to get you to go to the hotels with them to claim prizes. This got annoying as there are so many people doing the same thing and some are quite pushy. We walked along the beach once but didn‚Äôt return again.
Ciggie123,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2019,We are staying right on the beach which is lovely just to look at but too rough for swimming most days.  Sand is awful 
Margaret B,"Calgary, Canada",Jan 2019,"At first glance upon arrival walking the beaches from Seminyak to Legian and Kuta and back my reaction was ‚Äúare you kidding me‚Äù. The words that comes to mind were SAD, PATHETIC, A TRAGEDY! In our travels, this is the filthiest beach we ever visited. There were a number of surfers taking lessons and others swimming. If I had children there is no way I would allow them to swim in those waters.  The first couple weeks the beaches were much the same, some days much worse than others. There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions. Sometimes we can be too quick to judge a place. Sadly for some we met, they only had a few days or a week to visit it at it‚Äôs worse."
paul,10 contributions,Feb 2019,Easy access. Lots of seating at bars and restos. Nice for family visits.  Not too noisy and lots of different price offering. 
WarneAu,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,Nice place to spend an evening with good restaurants to choose from and  listen to live music. Clean beach area. Don‚Äôt know how safe to swim. 
Brage N,9 contributions,Feb 2019,"Granted, the weather was bad, but the beach wasn't great.  The sand is dark brown and there are some stray dogs there."
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2019,Visited during my long walk along the coastal beaches of Kuta area. This beach was a bit cleaner than the previous ones but still had plenty of plastic around. Nice area and plenty of places to view sunset in the afternoon.
Leslie L,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,The amount of plastic washed up on shore is horrific. Apparently Indonesia is second only to China for plastic pollution in our oceans. Such a shame.
CharisseThompson,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Dec 2018,"It‚Äôs always refreshing to be at the beach. Great surfing waves, clear water, and warm sand between your toes."
Selena D,"Manchester, UK",Dec 2018,Every morning the locals clean this beach before the tourists get there because it is full off pollutions that comes in from the ocean. It‚Äôs a nice enough beach (after the clean up) but there are better beaches such as Echo beach and Nusa Beach. This beach is perfect for watching the sunset though!
davolitribe,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,"So much rubbish floating in the water........water is beautiful and warm and the atmosphere great, but it's all let down by the floating rubbish and debris in the ocean. Something needs to be done......"
Noelene G,"Epping, Australia",Jan 2019,Nice sunset......but beach was full of rubbish.  Was not nice seeing a man drown and all the tourist just taking pictures.
John and Les C,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Jan 2019,We were in Seminyak in early/mid January 2019 and saw some great sunsets.  Nice to walk along the beach during the day and visit Ku Da Ta and Potatoe Head.
Sammimitch6,"Haltwhistle, UK",Jan 2019,"Wow what an amazing huge beach which goes on forever. You'll certainly not feel overcrowded on this beach! Great for surfing to & lots of bars & restaurants nearby. It was a shame to see lots of plastic lying around on it but there was people there every day trying to pick it up, such a shame our world has let this happen, well done for trying to keep on top of it."
Sue T,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2019,A great place to sit with a glass of wine to watch the beautiful sunset.  Lots of locals will come up and try to sell their wares but they are making a living so I didn‚Äôt find it a problem. Lots of bats on the beach to buy beer. We brought our own wine.
Alexey Ivanov,"Moscow, Russia",Jan 2019,"Been here many times, great sunset many nice cafes along the beach, great place for cocktails and meet up with friends"
Marynik2,"Bathurst, Australia",Jan 2019,"We went for a walk along the beach and it was considerably cleaner than other Bali beaches( Sanur, legion, kuta)I would probably go for a swim too as the water wasn‚Äôt washing up piles of plastic! The beach out the more expensive resorts( legian , oberoi) was pretty much spotless and we only encountered less than half a dozen hawkers along the way. Obviously they pay to keep them at bay. "
Bettina W,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jan 2019,We spent one night in Seminyak and went to check the beach in the morning... we were very disappointed! The water is so dirty that we did not go in...there are great hotels on the beach and waves for surfers but unfortunately the water is dirty and the beach is not that great. There are many better options in Bali
Karen G,Tauranga,Jan 2019,"What a shame that what could be a great beach is filthy. Rubbish everywhere and the main entry smell disgusting. The beach is long and pretty is it went for this. Tourist will be more and more turned of visiting if the local population don't start to take a pride in where they live.  There was no one renting sun loungers, why would you to look at rubbishing washing in and out on the beach. There were a lot of surfers so I assume that's the main draw, however there are red flags lining most of the beach indicating rips and unsafe swimming areas. We only visited once preferring to swim in our villa pool instead."
CapeTurning,"Iisalmi, Finland",Dec 2018,"(written after 1st day, update after that)After starting our Bali trip in Sanur, where the beach was clean, with zero plastic and crystal, still waters, the Seminyak beach DUMP was a shocking experience!A very nice, classic monumental beach, tens of kilometres long, and more than 50 m wide, with this solid, easy-walking sand, BUT FULL OF PLASTIC! Both the beach and the water as well. And small rivers bring sewage, nauseous.Could not swim at all, so ugly! Fortunately we had such a nice villa, we could stay there.About this disaster we discussed for long with our villa manager. Well, he said that the beach is not such all the time, but twice a year. Then there is certain wind, that now started blowin 4 days ago, and it brings a lot of wood pieces and plastic ashore.Usually lasts around a week. Good thing to see, compared to eg. Thailand, was to see, that there was an army of government paid workers cleaning beach, and trucks driving the waste away. On our 1 hour walk I think we saw more than hundred workers on a 2km strip of beach.Still, it will last days for the sea to vommit all the carbage to the land for them to pick up.I asked where is the litter from, and the manager told us, it is from ther rivers, namely Balis own rivers, not coming further away. He said there is a lot going on in Bali to tackle the issue, but the change is slow, and presumed it take at least one lifetime. They do realize that tourists won't come if it is not clean!And, maybe tourists have already started to shun Bali as both in Sanur and in Seminyak it was really quite, the restaurants empty all night etc.?They are banning the plastic straws already, which is a start, but most of the plastic litter seems to be smaller than plastic bags, these everyday wrappers for food. Why do we need to wrap a single sweet into plastic?(updated after the second last day)Well, during the last day, the beach seemed cleaner, the armies of cleaners had succeeded and it seemed less new trash coming. However, when standing in the sea knee deep, almost every wave brouht ugly things to skin...(updated after the last day)The situation got even better, less crap. A New Hope!#hopingforthebetterworld #stoptheplasticpollution"

Stephan S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Dec 2018,"Visited here x2 during our stay, sun loungers readily available and the accompanying service cannot be faulted, you run a bit of a gauntlet as you arrive ( multiple vendors asking you to stay on ‚Äútheir ‚Äú loungers‚Äù when walking was disappointing to see the amount of plastic still even though there has been a push to reduce usage of plastic bags."
Barry M,Siem Reap,Jan 2019,"We‚Äôre here for a week and wishing we‚Äôd researched more thoroughly before booking a villaThe beach is a tip. It‚Äôs strewn with litter, especially plastic. Some hotels make a half hearted effort to clean up the patch outside their property but it‚Äôs token. We took some pics outside the Oberoi, Legian, Ku de Ta. Judge for yourself Worse from a health point of view is the stinking effluent that drains across the beach in several places. A beach stroll means having to walk or wade through untreated sewage.And people actually swim and lay down among this sh:t. Yuk. "
Rian L,15 contributions,Jan 2019,We spent the day at the beach and what a nice place not to crowded and very pleasant. Water was very enjoyable and will definitely go there again.
CiaraG,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2018,"Seminyak Beach is a good place to see the sunset, but cannot particularly recommend it for tourists during the day. The beach is full of piles of rubbish, & there is (as pictured below) rubbish in the ocean & washing up on the foreshore. Definitely wouldn't recommend for swimming, or water activities of any kind! If you're looking for swimming beach, head down to Nusa Dua üèñÔ∏è It can be nice to walk along the beach (if you're that kind of person), & there was a swing set up down there during our visit (Dec 18) for tourists to take pictures with. There are a good number of beach bars around with pools, however these get unbelievably busy & we couldn't even find a place to be served. Overall, a good place to see the sunset, but I'd give the typical beach activities a miss! üåá"
Bhavicp,"Fiumicino, Italy",Jan 2019,"Decently clean beach and quite big. Sand is very very soft (black sand)Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach with pretty good prices for drinks and food.  Around 100k for a cocktail and 80k for chicken Nachos- sitting on the beach on bean bags and live music at night. Didn't seem to be any bugs either, even at 9pm. Must go here for a lovely sunset experience  "
wendy c,barcelona,Dec 2018,"We stayed in Seminyak for 2 weeks during Christmas and New Year. We‚Äôve been coming to Bali for 24 years but always staying in Bali Hyatt in Sanur then to Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua. This time though, we decided to rent a villa in Seminyak, 5 minutes walk from Ku De Ta.On our first day, I ran on the beach. It was DISGUSTING! I saw dogs pooing on the beach, pile  of rubbish so high I thought from afar that  they are piling it for new year‚Äôs bonfire until I got close to it and it was a pile of rubbish. I ran for 5 km and it was just horrifying.  I‚Äôve never seen this part of Bali and I feel so sad that such beach condition exists.Also the pack of dogs that are present along the beach can be very intimidating and very aggressive. Parents especially with small children, Beware!"
haqsta,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,"Please see review of Double Six Beach where essentially say beach is wide and great for walking yet feels a bit dirty with the occasional whiff of sewage. That said (!) it is a very nice walk past all the beach bars at sunset from Double Six right up to La Lucciola The W, Alila and all the great Beach bars around that part. Quite a social walking vibe at sunset"
Teo,Petaling Jaya,Jan 2019,Be sure to come here when you are in Seminyak. It is just within walking distance or you can ride a bike to here. The sunset is picturesque. 
wayne j,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,Last time we were in Seminyak was in 2008 and what a difference ten years make! Could not believe the amount of rubbish on the beach and also what was coming in on the tide! Go for a surf or swim here? No way! Stop consuming people and take care of your rubbish!
Luciana M,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jan 2019,"I was very disapointed! It was the First place I visited in Bali, the beach is dirty, there is garbage everywhere. The beach is not beautiful, I stayed 4 nights in Seminyak, I wouldnt stay there again, I would go to Canggu or Uluwatu in instead"

Jazy1,"London, UK",Dec 2018,"I found the beach unclean.  I‚Äôm use to white sands the whole nine yards.  I can‚Äôt compare it to the Caribbean of course. I do think there needs to be more effort to maintain it.  Definitely the most expensive beach I have been to just to hire a beach chair, more so than Jamaica negril believe it or not. Roughly ¬£12 for less than 4 hours. Ludicrous."

Deanne D,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2019,Nice beach. Be careful where you walk though as there is a large amount of plastic getting washed up onto the beach. This is very sad as apart from that it is very pretty. You can walk along the beach for a long way. There are touts selling all sorts of things on the beach too. Be sure to swim between the flags as there are dangerous bits.
"Theo Botha-chef,restauranteur,hotelier",301 contributions,Jan 2019,"Nice beach to learn how to surf.Its a natural black sand or volcanic sand beach.Problem is,there is just so much rubbish all over the beach.It really spoils the feel and natural beauty of the shoreline .You can rent a surfboard for 50k for 1 hour .more expensive than eco beach where you can get it for 2 hours.Rent sun-beds  for 100k an hour.Loads of bars on the beach to have a cocktail or beer.Kids loved it there.The local ladies sell their chicken skewers on the street.you have to try them.delicious!"

Jared F,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Dec 2018,"Went to the beach, as it was very hot in Bali only to find that the water was cloudy and had many items floating in it."
Kathyboddy,"Derby, UK",Jan 2019,"It was a vile and shocking experience to walk along the beach and water‚Äôs edge, and virtually impossible to avoid the huge amount of plastics, debris and rubbish littering miles of the coastline. Adding to this was the awful smell from the rivers of Seminyak where they crossed the beach. So sad. "
Darren P,MANCHESTER,Dec 2018,"Dirty beach, not great for swimming as lots of debris washing into the sea after rainfall inland. Lots of discarded nappies to walk around on the sand, cleaners were at work but I feel more should be done."
cterrantroy,"Chatswood, Australia",Jan 2019,There are numerous bars that put beanbags out at around 5pn and set up for a DJ or live duo band. It's great to drink and eat with the sun set over the horizon. We do this as a ritual everytime we are here.

Dawsay,"Leeds, UK",Dec 2018,A lovely beach with some beautiful views at sunset. This was our second time there in 2 years but it‚Äôs really gone done hill. We had one big concern with waste and plastic which seems to be an issue with it being washed up.The larger hotel groups should combine to fund a team to walk up and down it daily (perhaps first thing in the morning at sun rise) lifting the waste. Not only would it creat employment within Indonesia it would greatly improve the negative declining image of the beach.
aeroguy65,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Dec 2018,"It‚Äôs sad to see the beach being littered with rubbish! A lot of trash are being thrown on the beach itself. The last time I visited the beach was about 5 years ago and it wasn‚Äôt that bad. I guess with the influx of tourist the beach is now suffering the consequences. The sunset view is amazing, you just need to look up and bypass all the dirt on the beach itself."
manosk1,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Where is this coming from??? Just go close to Mano club restaurant and judge for yourself..The washed out garbage by the currents will still bother you but a lot less..Legian, Samaya, Seminyak beach and other top notch resorts doing a great job to clean the litter,But the smell from the flowing waters direction from the city to the sea is just unbearable. Seminyak beach is wonderful to walk up and down and the sunset is stunning. However, better use the pool of your hotel for a dive...If you‚Äôre still brave enough and want to swim or surf the beautiful waves, better be vaccinated and I‚Äôm not kidding at all.I‚Äôm residing in Asia Pacific and travel to Bali four times per year (I love the place and the people tourist scammers included as by now I know how to protect myself), I‚Äôve reported the issue couple of times to the local authorities and as usual, hope dies last..Happy 2019, guys!"

Magnus,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2018,The beach have plenty of good restaurants and you can rent umbrellas! But it‚Äôs really depressing that the beach is full of plastic. Especially in the morning before the daily cleaning team has been there.
nicethingsinlife,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2018,"For a destination that heavily relies on the beauty of its environment to attract visitors, it's heart-breaking to see the constant piles of rubbish that wash ashore each day.  Despite the daily cleanups that are done by some businesses, the supply of trash seems endless.  This is not what tourists come for but how must it be for the people of Bali? They have to see and live in this everyday.  On land, waste management is pretty inefficient.  This is a complicated problem that requires many different groups doing their part.  Restaurants seem to be adopting some operational changes (like using compostable straws) but much, much more needs to be done here."
Miken2603,"Abergavenny, UK",Dec 2018,The beach is sandy and generally clean but the water does contain a small amount of plastics/rubbish. The water is shallow but quite big and powerful waves start breaking about 30m off-shore. There is an undertow but I only got concerned in stormy weather. Good for body-boarding and learning to surf. . There is a surf school at the beach.

spensterr,"Fort Collins, CO",Dec 2018,Nice beach that isnt over run with locals trying to sell you junk or a quick massage. Much different then Kuta beach in that sense. Good breaks for those surfing and great views for those just catching the sunset.
rameshkanesan,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"Its a great beach, however needs to get rid of the rubbish. They have to place bins at the beach as it is not safe. Broken glasses and plastic. Bali is cutting down 70% of plastic waste. Pls start with the beaches...because its still a great beach."
Ana,"Shinjuku, Japan",Dec 2018,"Dirty, yes, but the locals seem to be doing their best to clean up. I hope the tourists would do their part as well.Also, no swimming allowed except for a small area... although surfers also occupy that part too, so I guess it's not for people who just want to get in the water."
Marj B,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"So we were excited to enter the entrance gate to the beach ready to swim. We saw the nice beach bars and wanted to watch the sunset but was turned off by the smelly sewerage water flowing onto the beach. We wanted to go right towards potato beach head club but couldn‚Äôt cross due to the sewerage water, disgusting.Dogs were around as well as their poop.Shame it could be really one of the best beaches."
Philippetravel,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2018,"What a Great waves.... Great surf... Great beach, This used to be...Now a plastic dump...Every wave brings New Floors of plastic!Spent a lot of time in the traffic jam toGet toThe beach...And then you spent your holiday on a dump...Stay at home, forget about This paradise iT used to be...Now it‚Äôs nothing more than a totally wasted beach.... full of plastic...To swim, is impossibleWithout touching plasticWith every movement....Avoid This place..."
Hiyas,Atlanta,Dec 2018,"Frankly disgusting.As some reviews have mentioned, the beach is a litter box . We saw stray dogs pooping on the beach and one dog with owner just covered his dog's poop with sand. Yikes! Some unleashed dogs are also aggressive and start barking at passersby. Huge plies of trash mostly plastics just left on the beach."
E9837BUjohnl,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2018,Beautiful beaches and load of beach bars. Good food at your fingertips would recommend to any one traveling there 
Sangeetha S,"Bangalore District, India",Dec 2018,This beach is something we saw on our last day at Bali and it was beautiful!! So bohemian feeling with surfers and colourful bean bags music and the beautiful skies!! Was gorgeous!! 
Douglas G,"Isle of Portland, UK",Nov 2018,"There is a point where you can get onto the beach without going through one of the many hotels that dominate the beachfront.  Head for Seminyak hotel and there is a point where there is a large scooter park and some limited off-road car parking.  Walk through the gateway onto the beach.  There are lots of sun beds in both directions with large sun umbrellas presumably for a charge.  I wanted a long walk and turned right( north) to head past a few of the other hotels that all front onto the beach.  They all look good hotels.  A few beach vendors but not too annoying! Very long shelving Sandy beach out to rough breakers.  Good for surfing but not my sort of seabathing, too churned up and no visibility, snorkelling forget it.  However not to be churlish you can walk for miles on nice sandy beach with blue skies üòÑ so nice to look at but I will be swimming in the pool.  There are a few points where water is flowing off land to the sea which was a bit whiffy!  Not sure what water quality standards are but would want to check before I went surfing.  If you look to left at the entrance point to the beach there is a narrow promenade walk (lol) guess what it‚Äôs full of scooters, endearing the way they use the pavements so look out and give way because they won‚Äôt!!! Along here there are a succession of beach bars and restaurants.  I wanted to give a 4 but went for a 3 purely because I like clear seas so maybe this is just me being picky because I had a lovely walk and the beach had been cleared quickly after the storm this week, so top marks there OH well, perhaps I will give it a 4 üòÑüëèüòÑ"
MPandu,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Sunset view is wonderful, and the wind breeze is very relaxing. There are just too much plastic here that some points are unwalkable."
vickew2016,"Middle Swan, Australia",Dec 2018,"We stayed in the month of December and found the beach full of rubbish and vegetation which washed ashore each day. However early each morning teams of locals arrived and cleaned it up, taking away loads of rubbish. So by mid morning the beach was all clean and beautiful again. One local did say that this only happens at this time of year because of the prevailing winds. "
DebsMmm,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2018,a beautiful place to sit and watch the sunset each day with a cocktail in hand.  So many places to choose to sit and listen to different musicians and have a snack and drink.
Sick B,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2018,There is rubbish everywhere and it is used by the stray dogs and cats as a giant litter box. It's not the most inviting of beaches. You are better off enjoying it from a distance at one of the many resort's that overlook it.
Williemac32,"Thurso, UK",Nov 2018,The beach is an awesome place to see the sunset. The beach is clean with various sections renting loungers and providing cold drinks/food. It also has various surf schools /rental of boards. Beach is well flagged showing possible rips. Surf can be quite wild depending on the weather.
Rina Cannon (N√©e Purba),"Chennai (Madras), India",Dec 2018,"Visited Seminyak Beach for the first time. Clean beach and good for relaxing. During this period or December, the waves is pretty high. Not good for swimming but perfect for surfing. "
JohnDaglas1,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,Great for a beer at beach tables. Awesome sunset - a must go avoid many restaurants ECT. SURFING dudes that set up tables & chairs in Afternoon amazing. Also Sun beds at reasonable prices
Maryyum N,"Cleveland, OH",Dec 2018,"The beach would be the perfect place to spend your day.  Unfortunately, there is trash everywhere and it ruins the mood. "
LUCY,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2018,Nice place to spend time with friends catching up the sunset. There's a lot of restaurants and cafe. Just pick what you like and how much money you wanna spend.
Mark and Mikaela,"Vientiane, Laos",Dec 2018,"Touristy, lots of people and nice little food stalls but it‚Äôs a shame that the stretch of beaches are all polluted with rubbish! "
Sachin0408,"Pune, India",Oct 2018,What might have been a wonderful beach in the past is currently in a sorry state of affairs. I have heard from so many friends that Seminyak was once a beautiful clean and clear beach but when I visited in October it was far from the truth. Human beings would never learn to behave and very soon this entire planet would turn into a pile of garbage. I felt sorry for the beach.
grey_hare63,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"I've been to Seminyak beach over the past few years and it has always been reasonably clean. But in my latest trip it was in a horrific condition with plastic and rubbish strewn across the entire beach for as far as I could see.  We went into the water and were surrounded by thousands of pieces of plastic wrappers and other rubbish!  It was brushing against our arms, legs and body! I wonder if this is a seasonal problem or permanent problem?  If the latter, then this will be the end of Seminyak beach as we know it... a very sad state of affairs."
Vicki W,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Dec 2018,We went their yesterday and the thing thst hit me straight away was the rubbish. It is disgusting. I was horrified. How can a beach like this be so iconic. I walked Into the water to my ankles and got hit with rubbish and walked straight out again. I am not interested in swimming with a heap of trash.We were at the far end and I thought may be it gets better further down. Nope it gets way worse. There are literally piles (like 20 feet high) of rubbish on the beach. Not just one pile but several. Are they relying on people being too drunk to notice that this beach is a rubbish dump.This is disgraceful. There were a few tourist (me being one of them) cleaning up the rubbish on the beach. That is not my idea of a day at the beach. Get your act together Bali if you want tourists to continue coming. 
Mintra,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2018,"This beach is disgustingly dirty. I stayed in seminyak for 5 days (first time in Bali) just walking distance to the beach and was extremely disappointed. It‚Äôs a combination of people littering as well as the sewage or river water getting dumped right onto this beach. Had to walk on the sand with shoes on and when I decided to put my feet in the water I was splashed with trash and rocks. Pick a different beach to go to like Ulu Watu, much cleaner. "
Pepperpot,"San Cayetano, Spain",Dec 2018,Beach is not nice it‚Äôs full of rubbish that they try to clean every day by hand and one digger. The waves are massive only fit for surfing. Going in the ea your legs get wrapped up in plastic bags and othe washed up rubbish
Vijay singh R,"Chandigarh, India",Dec 2018,"crowd is limited as compared to kuta beach, drinks are nice, clean beaches, superb view at sunset..."
Martin W,"Gravesend, UK",Nov 2018,"A really nice beach which they work hard at keeping clean. After an overnight storm lots of waste was washed up on the beach, which was cleaned up by the hotels and bars.From 4pm bean bags and sound systems come out so you can relax and watch the sunset. "
Cynthia A,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"Exactly, just another beach. There were pieces of rubbish along shoreline but this is a common sight of marine debris nowadays. The beach benches are rented for rp75000 per bench per hour. "
Elin N,"Oslo, Norway",Nov 2018,"The beach itself is sandy, fine and miles long. Not very suitable for swimming. Perfect for new surfers and bodyboards.A sunset beach - late afternoon restaurants and bars along the shore, makes the beach into a bar-street.Be aware of the tide ! Some places plastic and other garbage can drift in to the beach, due to current, wind and tide. Please bring a bag to help Seminyak a clean beach. Some of the sunbed owners often help to clean themselves üëç Possible to snorkle some places very close to shore. In all a superb beach, even if it is difficult to swim there.  "
Dom N,25 contributions,Dec 2018,Nice beach with ample facility by the beachside.Good subset view. Specifically give a try to la cuciolla and Kuta de Kuta .
Linda G,"Hornchurch, UK",Nov 2018,Our hotel was opposite the beach so literally left the complex onto the beach which is a lovely beach both day and night. Many bars have live bands in the evening so great to sit and relax of an evening after spending a day doing nothing 
hamishb866,"Wichian Buri, Thailand",Nov 2018,"Really poor.Rubbish all along the beach,plastic,needles etc.Even when swimming you could feel plastic bags etc wrapping around your feet.Sunbeds expensive."
MegzNoel,"Coolangatta, Australia",Dec 2018,Probably one of the cleanest beaches I've seen on the island. There's also some swings which are food for photos.
Renno2355,"Liverpool, UK",Nov 2018,There are a number bars on the beach serving food which was excellent and cheap as is the beer Bintang.We walked from Butabelig beach to Kuta beach some 10 miles round trip. The beaches were full of plastics and general rubbish. I also picked up a light bulb and glass brown bottle which I dread to think what injuries they would have caused.The sea is quite rough with warnings of strong currents and red flags.
Damian S,"Victoria Point, Australia",Nov 2018,"Wife loved it.                       Said would recommend a look! Got drinks etc brought to them. Would go back for a look, but cant control the weather "
Paul H,"Garstang, UK",Nov 2018,"A very nice walk from my hotel to the beach, access is a bit limited, but once you are on it, a vast expanse of sand. "
Caroline East,"Berlin, Germany",Apr 2018,Sea is quiet and beautiful. Great for beginners. It's safer to crash on the sand than on a rifs. Miss it.
Elaine,104 contributions,Aug 2018,Long sandy beach that had many brightly coloured umbrellas and lounge areas to enjoy food and drink on the sand.  Lots of Lots of live music around. 
Jessie W,50 contributions,Nov 2018,Seminyak beach has more restaurants along the beach. We hv made right choice to stay at seminyak. Quiet and nice place
Michelle,"Brandon, UK",Nov 2018,Black sand that sticks to your feet. The amount of plastic and rubbish washed up on the beach is absolutely horrendous and upsetting. I cleared rubbish up on numerous occasions.  They should employ people to clean the beach often to keep it clean. The sea is too rough to swim in but ideal for surfers. Has the most amazing sunset and is very popular for that. 
Roy F,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,Went to the beach via Ku De Ta in the morning for a walk when there is less crowd. Nice view of the beach and sea.
Lin09,"Bromley, UK",Nov 2018,"Very disappointed.  The beach is large and plenty of good bars and restaurants with bean bags to sit out on, eat drink and watch sunset.   BUT there is so much plastic rubbish washed up with the tides. This gets cleaned up, often with tourists helping. But the plastic and rubbish on beach is a huge problem  and not a pleasure to walk through to get to the sea. Something needs to be done as this is not going away "
hornet450,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2018,Walked down to the beach to watch the sunset on Sunday. Hundreds of locals were there too. Really nice atmosphere & shared the sunset with local families enjoying an afternoon off.
Mikesgirls5,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"Wow Seminyak is a wide, long, colourful beach with big wakes for surf üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è and for the young at heart. Loads of people especially for sunset üåÖ. Lots to see and do would recommend to see and experience it."

foodcrawlph,"1,536 contributions",Nov 2018,"Coolest, hippest, and the busiest part of Bali. Searched for a couple of accommodation options and chose to stay in Seminyak. Land transfers can be easily rented to any point of destination. Transportation within the area ranges from motorbike, GrabCar, GoJek, or the common Bluebird Taxi. We booked a decent hotel close to the beach. There are a lot of stores, restaurants, and specialty shops around. The beach provides a panoramic view by sunset and surfers flock in for the tide. "

Christie And Steve,"South Fremantle, Australia",Nov 2018,We love it down at Seminyak.. lots of places to choose to eat from on the beach and nothing beats a Bintang on a beanbag when it‚Äôs beaming with sun outside! Good surf for beginners too üòä
Swift D,13 contributions,Dec 2017,If you like surfing this is one of the beaches to come to as they have nice size waves you can hire a chair for 50 bah for the whole day they they have a variety of restaurants within walking distance as well.

jody262016,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Nov 2018,"At this end of  the beach it was great, take a towel or hire a day bed. Cold drinks available from numerous esky set ups and sellers are there if you need sarongs etc go and watch the sunset it is amazing"
Tim O,"Spokane, WA",Nov 2018,"Seminyak is nice, but it is equally as busy.I am glad we stayed in this part of town as it seemed like a great bargain, but when we come back, we may go someplace more quiet and relaxing like Sanur."
SeanIFN,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,Good location for people who likes nature and would like a romantic walk with their significant half. Also great place for a swim and surfing although there are better beaches for this purpose.
Gwendoll,"Pitt Meadows, Canada",Oct 2018,"My first impression of Seminyak beach was simply: ""wow"".We went on a day that would be classified as an overcast but yet the beach was filled with people. Luckily the beach stretched on for miles on either side so there was plenty of room for everyone. I did not rent a lounger as I only planned on staying for a couple of hours but upon talking to the locals they were very friendly and the rates were reasonable to rent loungers.The sand on this beach is like no other, it is so soft yet sticks to your skin like paste. The beach was very clean and the water very refreshing. It was fun to watch surfers try to catch a wave."
Alexandra C,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Marvellous beach, dark sand, amazing mood. We went to a beach bar who had coloured umbrellas with lights that offered a whimsical surrounding. I felt safe also. People are very friendly."
Sylvia K,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2018,"Visited the beach after my visit to Petitenget Temple as it is just across the carpark from it.The beach reminded me of my uni days when I visited Mandura, Australia during summer.The sand is black and fine and hence, when you attempt to walk along the beach, it is advisable to walk bear footed.  It is rather safe to do so.If you intend to swim, you have to do so in the safe zone (between the flags).  The waves are crashing and therapeutic."
mariaom1523,"Birr, Ireland",Oct 2018,"An amazing beach which stretches for miles. Everything for sun lovers, surfers with superb schools, beach attendants, lively bars, toilets and showers . Sunsets glorious and attended by thousands of people from all round the world. Superb experience. Fine white sands and warm ocean-what's not to like?"
markbutt62,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,excellent local bars and restaurants along beach for all day sun baking to afternoon drinks while watching the sunsets or settle down for dinner at one off the bean bag restaurants
Guni G,"Tay Ninh, Vietnam",Oct 2018,Large beach with overwhelming sunset. Enjoying cocktails fron the pub on the beach and we all know that live is too short to stay at home. 
Deb davies,"Chepstow, UK",Nov 2018,Spent most time at double six beach it's beautiful stunning to sit relax and watch the sunset üåÖ just be aware of then selling you things on the beach that can be a bit of a pain  other than that. It's  lush 
Robyn F,"Newcastle, Australia",Oct 2018,I was impressed that a tractor cleaned the beach up to Legian each morning. The surf schools were always busy with lots of laughter. My husband enjoyed a surf while I walked along the beach warding off a few beach lounge sellers along the way. A nice way to start the day. 
Rachel G,12 contributions,Jul 2018,"This beach is great for surfing and watching beautiful sunsets. We had a great time surfing and lounging on beach chairs. However, it is incredibly busy and isn't overly blue or beautiful."
Nicolas D,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Nov 2018,The large waves make this beach great for Surfing rather than scuba diving or swimming. The beach is quite long making it a place for walkers and joggers. Please like this review if you found it useful. 
mjwnjw,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2018,Great beach to visit to sun yourself - people watch - have a Bintang - even do a spot of shopping ! Not far from Seiryu Villas so we walked down each day ! 
Sonia L,Butler,Oct 2018,Nice clean beach for a morning walk one side is full on bars/restaurants the other a lot quieter with mainly smaller  resorts.Lots of surfers & swimmers.
Howard M,66 contributions,Nov 2018,Dirty volcanic beaches. No cleaning. Over commercialised at sundown. Prices at the beach bars were more expensive than in town but still cheap compared to England. Worth paying a bit more to sit and watch the sunset with a chilled Bintang. (Local beer)
Alaa Hafez,Egypt,Nov 2018,It was a beautiful beach.. but a little bit boring ... But it was clean and the scene was very nice ..‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Rosscodad,"Northamptonshire, UK",Oct 2018,"It‚Äôs a busy fun beach, but well looked after. Don‚Äôt go if you are looking for peace and quiet! Surf looks great, and plenty of places to hire boards, eat, drink etc. It‚Äôs colourful! Loads of sun beds to chill out on  for the day..... gets really busy around sunset, sit back on a coloured bean bag, and absorb the spectacular sun set. Great atmosphere... with beer in hand...and lively way to watch the sun go down. Definite ‚Äòdo once‚Äô when you are on Bali! "
Helsie111,"Toowoomba, Australia",Oct 2018,Watch beautiful sunset on Seminyak Beach. Bring towel to sit on. Real Bali feel with the umbrella on the beach.
David W,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",Oct 2018,Clean beach. Not overly crowed except at sunset! Lots of surfing places to choose from. Unobstructed beach so you can run/walk all the way to Kuta beach. Lots of restaurants/bars offering places to sit for the sunset. Definite recommend. 
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"Beautiful but busy beach. Good to relax or surf or just a beach walk. The main entrance is at jln Dhynapura where you can find a lot of restaurants, pubs, bars and shops as well as hotels. Always a pleasure here."

Warwick S,"Lane Cove, Australia",Oct 2018,"If white sands, light breeze and gentle surf lapping your ankles is your vision then this beach may not always be for youGrey sand, a pounding surf and polluted shore greeted our first look You can hire a bean bag and watch the island sunset with a beer or visit one of the many hotel bars and clubs that line the shore It is busy and if you want seclusion this area may not be for you, however if you join the crowd , grab a beer you will fit in "
Sam W,"Goulburn, Australia",Oct 2018,Full credit to the locals here. The beach has really been cleaned up. A pleasant place to walk and relax now.  Well done 
Russell T,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2018,Relaxing on beanbags on the beach with music drawing a delicate background to the sound of breaking waves. Attentive staff providing food and beverages at our whim. I was so chilled I couldn‚Äôt feel my pulse.
susieque29,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2018,"Sad that such a long and stunning beach is so filthy. The sewerage that flows in to it from the is smelly and disgusting. Further along the beach, in front of Ku De Ta, the sewerage doesn't flow, but plastic cups and straws mix with the offerings on the sand. You have to dodge the plastic in the ocean. It's great to see the sunset, if you look past the rubbish."
nic0laf0x,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2018,good for older children playing in the water & flags available on the beach for swimming in. Water relatively dirty compared to what we are used to in NZ
CumbriaChevalier,Cumbria,Oct 2018,Lovely setting whether through the day or especially at sunset. There are opportunities to learn to surf or sit and relax with a beer and food. There are lots of beach restaurants offering good quality food and drinks.
Phoebe N,18 contributions,Jul 2018,Best spot to see sunset. There are lots of beach bars along the beach. You may grab a drink and relax by reading a book while waiting for sunset. There are also beach activities available.
lochiezacharyash2018,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,It is not the nicest beach in Bali. The east side of the island has the lovely beaches but not the sunsets.  It has black sand and is very smelly.

Haqibarra,6 contributions,Oct 2018,"Best spot to see the sunset. You can start beach acivity when you came here, u can chill with your lovely friends too, so many beach club there."
Annie K,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"Dropped off at the beach by courtesy vehicle attached to our Seminyak accommodation. There were pay for toilets nearby however  no changing sheds apparent.  Eventually I paid an attendant  for a toilet and changed in that.  Felt that a beach of this size and popularity  should have free  well signed changing  areas located at intervals along the beach front for beach goers to use.  Also ""Surfers Only""  signage was clearly  apparent on the sand along the beach and indicated to me as a visitor and  other beach goers  that there were no actual  areas that that the swimmers could go without sharing the water space with those surfing.  .  This is in fact  a safety hazard and appeared to be the case along  the entire  length of the  Seminyak beach where the surf is rolling in.  In the end - unable to find an area free of surfers and surf boards  we ended up just  dipping in the shallow areas and   swimming in an area that was utilized by a few surfers and then out of nowhere  a group  arrived  with instructors who were all   learning to surf because no areas had been cordoned off for just swimmers.    Not happy about this as an accident could have easily happened and we felt restricted in this beach/water situation."
Stockholmer_67,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2018,"This is not the Maldives or the Caribbean. One does not go here to swim in the sea, but it is great for surfers."
Trek802064,14 contributions,Oct 2018,"Views of the sun setting in the horizon was magnificent to experience.  Coupled with the atmosphere with crowds of people flocking the beach locals and tourists alike. All across the beach You See stretches of bars, restaurants and cafe, with outdoor settings.  At night time the beach lights up with live bands and music catered for most senses.   Disappointing to see plastic and rubbish littered across the sands though. Effluent from nearby streams are washed out to see so stay away from these areas.  Other than that, youll have local hawkers looking for a sale. If you catch there eye they will hone into you and haggle you to buy their products.  Not just one but a flock of hawkers will surrounding your location causing frustation and potentially ruining your peaceful place. I learnt to say ""no thank you"" in Indonesian - tidak terima kasih which they acknowledge more than saying it in English. Try it and see. "
Margaret O,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2018,"Worth a visit, I wandered from my hotel and explored the beach I was just having a quick look so I did not rent a sunbed. I did have a lovely young coconut to quench my thirst. As soon as I sat down I had ladies approaching me to buy their wares. I thought it a good time to buy some gifts for fellow work colleagues. I got a quick massage which I think I paid too much for. As I walked along the beach I could see people horse riding, having surfing lessons, and many colourful beach bars. I was at the beach mid morning. Worth a visit.   "
KwH819,"Northamptonshire, UK",Oct 2018,"This beach is fabulous with very colourful beach bars.Always wear flip flops though as the sand gets ridiculously hot!The tip i would give is stick to where the Air Asia umbrellas and loungers are. All the beach bars there have toilets.Passed that it is cooler and hipper but the beach bars don‚Äôt have toilets and the public ones are closed!Lovely chilled atmosphere with beanbag at the bars, which has no charge unlike the loungers. Just have to drink and/or eat."
LavishLady,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2018,Beautiful beach that stretches for miles and becomes very colourful as the sunsets with a hedonistic crowd and beautiful bean bags and umbrellas. The sand is yellow and the waters are a dark blue which can be wavy and rough but still very pleasant and great for surfers. I had three people massaging me on the beach for a few pounds it was amazing!! Lots of beach vendors but they actually had some lovely jewellery and art work and they are not forceful at all. Enjoy very much it‚Äôs the life :)
msizemore88,"San Antonio, TX",Oct 2018,Beach is great clean from debris and trash...waves are great. Good for surf or swim. We had a great time
corgi47,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,"Seminyak's vibe is hipper and cooler than Legian, and in particular, Kuta. It's very chilled and relaxed. The beach clubs are all pretty good, if not a bit same-same. The beach is lovely but the sand is darker than expected. Sunsets are amazing."
Sonica2012,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,We went to beach around sunset and must say the view is to die for. the sand is so good on the feat and pictures came out just perfect. the beach is quite clean and hav resturants to chill

joycewalesengland,WALES ENGLAND,Oct 2018,nice beach but the waves were high and we had a red flag each day You have to barter for the price of the chairs as we got it cheaper the second time we went
Kimboc34,"Neath, UK",Oct 2018,"Enjoyed our days by the beach watching the surfers tackling sometimes crazy waves... beach is very clean & the beach sellers very friendly & accept it when you do not wish to be bothered. Make sure you negotiate your price for sun beds & umbrella.At sunset grab a beanbag & a Bintang & watch the sun go down, absolutely amazing & well worth doing..... "
Brent K,16 contributions,Oct 2018,"It wasn't a clean beach at all. Water from waste pipes were running straight into the sea. It smelled like the drains if Seminyak in most parts. Worst of all, used plastics (and condoms unfortunately!) were to be seen on the water edge. If it wasn't for the muck, this would be a fantastic beach. Sunset was gorgeous but we won't be back."
Christine S,"Seoul, South Korea",Oct 2018,"My expectations were low due to several reviews of the beach being unclean, but I found it very clean. Didn‚Äôt swim in it though. Nice to walk along."
priti sahay,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017,"While Bali has various wonderful beaches, we felt Seminyak beach offered a perfect blend of beauty and fun. There were so many nice restaurants with romantic ambience, good music and good food. There were bean bags on the beach and you can spend hours looking g at the ocean. It gave such a surreal feeling. There are good places to shop also around the beach. Our best evening in Bali was on the Seminyak Beach without a doubt. "
Taylor H,"Gilbert, AZ",Oct 2018,"Seminyak Beach is beautiful to look at, especially at sunrise. However, waves were very strong and difficult to swim in. Plastic was littered throughout the beach, stray dogs were everywhere doing their business, and it constantly smells like an outhouse. There are much better beaches in the world to visit. I guess Bali doesn‚Äôt have them. It‚Äôs too bad they don‚Äôt care more about their environment. "
JohnPaul78,"Swindon, UK",Oct 2018,Went here from the hotel was told it wasn't far so decided to walk rather than take a taxi. It was about 40 mins so not too bad.Beach is lovely but it was quite rough as the red flags were flying. But we enjoyed our stroll up and back in and out of the water. 
Sonia G,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2018,Surf spot during the day yes but it‚Äôs a Great place to watch the sunset and have a drink!must be visited !
Ozmurt,"Warrnambool, Australia",Oct 2018,"Very hot and very dirty, only positive no hawker but no shelter unless your at a motel. Try another location. "
Brandon C,15 contributions,Oct 2018,Bali is amazing. I would definitely recommend anyone to travel there. The people and the food are wonderful.  The price is very affordable too.
V3AS,"Kanpur, India",Oct 2018,"I loved staying at the Seminyak Beach area. The beach is clean, the shopping  is interesting & the pubs are very lively. The place has loads of resturants serving mostly all international cuisines. "
Ghumakad Geetika,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Oct 2018,The beach has a beautiful horizon sunset. The waves in morn us very strong. Not recommended for swimming.  For surfers excellent beach
Henwoods24,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Oct 2018,"Busy, rather dirty, full of umbrellas, and far too many people and motorbikes. It was exactly as we expected, as we have travelled throughout Asia before, but certainly don‚Äôt visit Seminyak expecting a great beach. "
Elmo3168,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,"Nice sunset view at this location. Great for a visit. There are many restaurants along the beach , great for enjoyment"
CharlotteKirsch,"Reading, UK",Oct 2018,This isn‚Äôt the most idillic beach you‚Äôll ever see during the day. Just like most others and nothing special but during sunset it tops all other locations! Absolutely amazing. Sitting on the beanbags on the beach is just incredible to watch the sunset. 
marga,"Tenerife, Spain",Oct 2018,I spent two night in Seminyak close to the beach...If you are here you have to see sunset on the beach It‚Äôs really wonderful and you can see perfect 
glowworm27,Scotland,Sep 2018,We were a bit disappointed by this beach as there's a lack of sunbeds or outlets. The water is also really choppy so not recommended for swimming as there's often red flags up. Legian or Canggu are better for chilling.
Rob L,13 contributions,Oct 2018,Awesome beach with really helpful locals ensuring that if it is pampering you are after then you are in the right place . If you want to surf then you are in the right place also. Win win. 
djula1991,"Beijing, China",Oct 2018,The beach is clean and there are lots of waves for surfers. Surfboard rental is also available. Overall good for afternoon relaxing 
Sylvia DrSoul Fernandez,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Oct 2018,"This is a great beach for walking and jogging for it has sturdy sand and it has a lot of space! The small waves don‚Äôt seem good for swimming but ok for just having a dip in the water when you get too hot. Many nice shells to pick and many Beach chairs to pay for, restaurants and amazing sunsets!!"
CSJFR,"Ronse, Belgium",Sep 2018,I have no idea anymore wich beaches we have fine but we stayed in Seminyak and we did every beach. They are all a bit different but all good. We loved Manu beach house.
Pamela K,"Boston, MA",Jul 2018, Highly recommended- great beach without the crowds.  Waves and tides can be very strong though so stay aware. 
Wael D,4 contributions,Jul 2018,"This side of Bali Island is well known for Kite Surfing and Surfing generally due to high waves and strong wind.The Water is not clear and the sands are dark ""more like Mud""."
Westade75,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2018,Probaly would want to be a competant swimmer before you took a dip... Also make sure your injection and imunisations are up to date as the water looks pretty dirty...Not as hectik as Kuta though.. Not as many hawkers harrsssing you to buy junk either. 
ronster68,"London, UK",Sep 2018,A great beach which is perfect for long walks or even runs.The times I visited the sea was perfect fir surfers due to the waves and probably not too good fir swimmers.This is a very popular beach for people to watch the sunset and wow they are amazing.There are a number of bars and hotels to choose from should you wish to sit and have a drink while the sun goes down.It gets very busy. 
A7079CEjanes,"Worcestershire, UK",Sep 2018,"This is great beach but its mainly used by surfers as the waves are large.  All the time we were there, its seemed to be kept clean.There are lots of great bars to watch the sunset, the only downside was the hawkers trying to sell you stuff. A few of them would not take no for an answer.   I managed to go horse riding and its a great beach for this, its long and wide with lots of room."
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2018,Nice beach bars and restaurants along the beachNice place for dinner while watching sunset.Not as rowdy and dirty as Kuta beach and Legin beach
Scozziegirl,"Bassendean, Australia",Sep 2018,We walked here from our hotel for our first look at the beach in Bali. The seas were high and the beach was quiet so we had a easy walk from Ku DeTa up to Petinget beach and back. 
rolandlinda1,"Atenas, Costa Rica",Sep 2018,"This is a really beautiful beach, but waters are rough with big waves.  Consequently this beach attracts mostly surfers.  They do have nice lounger chairs that you can rent and people watch.  "
Escape683290,3 contributions,Sep 2018,Sat at Franks Bar on the beach had many bintangs...dinner next door at beach hut to watch the sunset What a wonderful experience met many new friends....
KapitiKiwis,"Raumati Beach, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"We went for walk along the beach. Grey sand, heavy seas for this time of year but clean. No shells. Not worthy for return. Great view at a distance."
Vinay S,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018,"Seminyak might comparatively be a quieter option among the ones you have on the stretch that includes Kuta and Double Six, but it can still get pretty crowded. Reason for that could be the fact that it has fantastic waves for those who seek to surf, and lets you enjoy one of the most majestic sunsets in the region. With an array of bars and restaurants facing the sea, you get enough and more places to just sit on a beanbag, gulp your beer with delicious starters, and enjoy the sunset. But with all those people and each restaurant playing their music, it can get a bit buzzy."
Amo572016,"Margaret River, Australia",Sep 2018,"We went to view the sunset on our last evening in Bali, and it didn't disappoint.Lots of people but it didn't feel crowded at all. "
Bridget R,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,It has the most amazing sunsets and best place to have a drink and some food on the beach whilst listening to music. Later in the night either a dj will play or live band !! 
Irene A,5 contributions,Sep 2018,"We stayed near the Double six beach, the beach is pretty clean compared to Kuta. The best is when you swim at the indian ocean while watching the sunset. And of course coconut water."
bffbpoole,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2018,This beach is clean and has many fine places to dine and drink all at a reasonable price we have always enjoyed this beach for all ages 
tommymoir,40 contributions,Oct 2017,Not my favourite beach. I found it  bit of a nuisance to get there first of all. What i found was a beautiful looking beech.  What i missed was natural shelter trees etc. I wad also warned of the potential rips in the area maybe that was why there was not many people in the water.  Sorry looks lovely but i prefer Kuta
TraciePAustralia,Australia,Sep 2018,"The waves were huge great for the surf lessons(even they waited til later when it calmed) we saw several rips so not for the little ones. We tried to relax on the lounges and have a Bintang and a swim but we were hassled that much buy the local wares we gave up and went back to the hotel pool. At night it's a fantastic spot to relax in a bean bag and listen to the live music, have a meal and watch the sunset. "
Rahim Y,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2018,"Very relaxing. A place your should at least spend a few hours, sit + drinks + have a meal + enjoy the sound of the wavesNight is perfect. Afternoon will be too hot. "
Cornelius,United Kingdom,Sep 2018,"Nice beach to have a early morning walk on, good for sunbathing & activities rest of the day, decent choice of beach bars and the likes, would recommend."
Deb A,queensland,Sep 2018,"we stayed at seminyak and in the afternoon would go to the beach for a couple of bintangs and watch the sunset and we found this great bar called sunset hut run by Duncan and with the help of Frankie and Rodney what a great crew, and they are well traveled so knowledgeable of bail and many other places plus they are always keeping an eye on things, whilst we were there they saved 2 kids in a rip. Highly recommend it is just opposite jayakarta resort facing beach just to your left."
Endru_06,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2018,The place that you can see sunset while dringking you beer. Very relaxing. will go there again soon...!
Julie S,19 contributions,Sep 2018,"It's very relaxing place to while away a few hours, bean bags under an umbrella with a table and table service,  amazing staff and the pizzas a fairly good."
MaraMara M,"Belgrade, Serbia",Sep 2018,"I‚Äôve never seen such big waves in my life. The beach is endless and has a lot of nice cafees.swiming is almost impossible, not suitable for little children and children without adults. I haven‚Äôt seen not even single lifeguard and currents are pretty strong and waves pretty big."
Barty,29 contributions,Sep 2017,"We had fun here.....the beach is clean enough, not as busy as Kuta, beach sun chair & board rentals are not at rip-off price. The only gripe is the peddlers approaching you at times. Recommended "
Tony W,"Orpington, UK",Sep 2018,The beach is long and fairly wide so is generally not crowded. The sections with sun loungers are busier but still ok.  The only really busy time and at sunset when hundreds visit to see the sunset. The tide has been rough whilst here so not able to swim from the beach. 
Veronique V,"Voorburg, The Netherlands",Sep 2018,Not a place if you are looking for calm and silence.Always disturb by people who want to sell any kind of things.The beach is really dirty and definitely for children.
teckjong,"Melaka, Malaysia",Sep 2018,Very crowded beach. Not like what we imagine. Views were blocked by sea of people and their ongoing activity.. 
Ren1211,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2018,"A nice spot to come and hang out, it's not the best beach in Bali but it is still beautiful and still a beach."
colleengiddings,"West Sussex, UK",Oct 2017,"Lovely sunbeds and very cheap for whole day and get a parasol too, lovely cold beer and coconut milk ice cold, loved the locals selling their wares along the beach made some lovely friends especially Wayana and Ellie sea is bit rough but still went in."
Christopher M,5 contributions,Aug 2018,"take a stroll along the sea, see kite flying, ride horse back, surf, eat and drink, comfy sun loungers (haggle for a deal) a great way to pass the time and get a tan"
JoLloyd,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2018,We came down several times to have a Bintang and watch the sunsets.. turn right instead of left and have better views of the glorious sunsets without the crowds :) Cheap beer and free views! 
SummerPoka,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2018,"This a beautiful beach with some of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen, but don't expect to be able to swim as the waves are very strong. Unlike other reviewers, I found the beach very clean, there was no littering at all during my visit in August.I stopped at the beach twice, once at sunset to enjoy the view and relax at one of the beach cafes, and it was perfect. The second time, I tried to swim and sunbathe and things were not ideal as the sand is black and tends to get very stick and hard to wash off, and the ocean has very strong waves.So if you go for sunset and evening vibes, not for swimming, you will be very happy."
Deb K,"Glenelg, Australia",Sep 2018,"Seminyak is good any time of the day, but from 4 p.m. onwards it takes on a whole new vibe. Lots of beanbags and umbrellas along the beach, out come the horses for a sunset ride. Chiringuito and La Plancha are great places for food and drinks. Chiringguito has the best wood fired pizzas, and nice clean toilets."
Chrysantha F,2 contributions,Sep 2018,Nice beach very safe beautiful view to see the sun setting don't need to Go to uluwatu you can see the sun setting from the beach
Ssmmiejay,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,"Seminyak Beach in the dry season is very clean.  Compared to when I went in January when there was rubbish all over the beach, this time I went there was none!  Make the effort to go down there before sunset and pull up an beanbag to soak up the sun, beer and sunset.  I even saw lots of people swimming!"
tonysyd274,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2018,On our last trip 3 years ago we remembered the beach and ocean being really dirty. Now it‚Äôs looking great and a beach you can happily grab that surf lesson or sit an watch an incredible sunset at one of the bars 
sab93924,"Warrington, UK",Sep 2018,"I wish I had known that it would cost to rent the sun beds every day as I would‚Äôve planned accordingly. Average price that people say is 200,000 but we haven‚Äôt paid above 100,000 for two. We have found that outside Capil Beach is the best spot as such and if you come later in the day the guy will give you a cheaper price than the rest! If you rent a sunbed you can use the toilet inside the restaurant as well. We also learnt to surf with these guys who are a right laugh and we both stood up first time There is lots of surfers and areas not suitable to swimmers along this section of the beach so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend to weak swimmers or young childrenThere is heaps of plastic and rubbish along the length of the beach, very sad to see! We have spent time out of our day to clean up "
Alaksander,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2018,"The beach is nice to walk on. the smooth white sand, nice sunsets and dotted with luxury resorts. However at the end of the beach before Legian beach or Double six, there is a smelly sewage that is hard to cross. We had to walk back.."
Swarnima V,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2018,"Perfect place to enjoy the sun, sand and the weather. We went in the evening, it was a 10 minute walk from our hotel- had a nice long stroll by the beach. It‚Äôs very clean and well kept  Sunset at the beach is a must watch for all visitors of Bali ... shacks here are nice ! U can try la plancha food and music !! "
Steve T,"Midland, Australia",May 2018,We from West Australia go up here and always ask why don't they clean the beach? the views are breathtaking and people are nice just needs a government to get in with the right equipment and clean the beach every day and not dump rubbish in the ocean. Why they don't look at fixing this has been the question fro 20 years.
Andhika K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2018,"As a local tourist,Bali is my fav place to escape from the hectic life of Jakarta, so I prefer to stay near the beach and not in rush to visit many places. Seminyak beach is my fav to spend the time and enjoy the sunset. It has magical view to see when the Sun sets with the red and golden sky.."
Neil3333,"Yeovil, UK",Aug 2018,"Great for surfers, not good for swimmers. We found the beach to be very polluted! walks on the beach included stepping over dirty nappies! not the idillic beach it could be"
keys4321,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2018,"Not overly crowded, beautiful beachfront, clean, all in all a great place to hangout with friends or just alone..."
Katia K,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2018,"One of the most beautiful sunsets you can see in Bali is on the Seminyak beach. And if you like to enjoy sunset with a cocktail in your hand, there are plenty of bars with comfy bean bags. The atmosphere is great here! Although very crowded as this is a popular spot in Bali, so be prepared and come a bit earlier It can be nice during the day as well, not a typical ‚Äúwhite sand blue water‚Äù kind of beach - but you can practice surf or have lunch while watching huge waves."
Slldcl,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Seminyak beach is clean, safe,  water clear and warm. Sand is darker than the white sands of Australia. Lots of restaurants are lined along the beaches, many with bands or music playing. Very family friendly, not too many hustlers."
radwas473,"Princeton, NJ",Aug 2018,We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids visiting from the USA. We loved this beautiful sandy beach. Walking distance to everything. Great waves. We had a blast!
ngj4,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2018,Family with 2.5yo toddler. It's ok for lounging around but not that good for children. Parts of beach close to fancy hotels are manicured otherwise rubbish in others. 
Debbie R,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,Perhaps we are a bit spoilt but we found this beach a bit disappointing with harsh black sand and lots of people.
DrNitinPuri,"Jalandhar, India",Aug 2018,Its a average beach with lots of pubs/restuarants on it. Beauty of sea is like any other beach. Sandy beach where some time can be spend
p4pranjal,"Surat, India",Aug 2018,This beach is a nice place to relax. White sand and a great sunset to watch. The water current is high so it is not advisable to go for swimming. I saw 3 people drowned in the sea. but there are life guards who saved them. Take care of kids and not let them go un attended in the sea. Overall a good place. 
Raag7,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018,Beautiful and clean beach. Good place for surf . Lots of bars good beer and cocktails vibrant beach umbrellas.
amtraveller_50,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018,Grab a bean bag and enjoy the sunset! A relaxed beach. Perfect for walking along. Great surf and lots of places to eat and drink.
Adelaide_Cat,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2018,A beautiful but busy beach with lots of great beach bars offering a nice relaxed vibe for some sunset beers and cocktails.
JonNewport,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,I have been coming to Bali for 35 years and today the beach was the cleanest I have ever seen. We walked from the temple near Laluciola to Jl Melasti and the beach was very clean. Congratulations to the beach staff for a job well done.Terima Kasih
JennyWilson0403,12 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach was ok, nothing great, and there was a fair amount of rubbish on the beach. They tried to cover it out by taking it out with a tractor I think, but as the day wore on it just all came to the surface of the beach. There are loads of nice beach bars and restaurants all the front, where it was nice just to relax, have a few drinks and some food."
Princess Leia,"Pyeongtaek, South Korea",Aug 2018,Seminyak has a lot of Bars and restaurant along the beach and its nice to just hang around and relax ... Clean and good for Surfing too ...
Alaa Gamaleldin,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2018,Good option Enjoy the nice views during sunset Suitable for coming early or at sunset Sandy nice beach area 
luisa25,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,This was my third time to this part of Bali and the cleanest the beaches have ever been! So nice not to dodge rubbish on our morning strolls.
Emma H,"Birmingham, UK",Aug 2018,This is a very busy beach with bars and restaurants all along the front with great menus. Although it‚Äôs busy it has a buzz and plenty of beds to hire. The sunsets here are also beautiful.
drshefalijanak,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2018,"We stayed at The Oberoi ... which is right at the Seminyak beach... clean, nice beach... watching sunset was so beautiful and serene! Kude ta and The Potato Head are the highlights on the beach!!"
Jimmy N,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Take the time to stroll around the village after being on the beach. Some good eating places there‚Ä¶Loved the Greek restaurant on the main drag..
Carla F,30 contributions,Aug 2018,We had never seen waves like we have in Bali. We liked the beach was lovely to have a walk along and watch the surfers.
Brooke E,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,"Seminyak beach is a typical tourist beach which it slightly quieter than Kuta. We happily spent the day there renting sunbeds, and checking out the bars along the beach, definitely caters for all budgets. The beach can get extremely busy at times especially around sunset time. The sunsets were beautiful. As mentioned in pervious posts rubbish can be an issue. "
stephenbH4999ZR,"Australind, Australia",Aug 2018,"Love this beach great surf, great people, great food. If you just want to sit & watch the world go by this is the place then top it off with an awesome sunset, you just won‚Äôt go wrong!"
Carol O,33 contributions,Aug 2018,"Lots of activity on Seminyak beach. Chairs and umbrellas to hire, drinks and ice cream to purchase, surf lessons etc. or just soak up the sun and read a book. Easy to get to, safe for swimming and perfect for early morning beach walks and sunsets"
Nick M,Brit in Copenhagen,Jun 2018,"Magnificent waves, ideal for surfing, but be a bit careful with the kids, the sea can get pretty rough. Plenty of good beachside bars and we were surprised how clean the beach was in June. "
default230820183,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2018,"Yes it‚Äôs slightly crowded, not so quite like Canggu or Nusa Dua. But, you can catch one of the most surreal sunsets from this beach. I was chilling on the Double Six Beach in Seminyak, had one of my best sunset experiences here. Well yes took advantage of the crowded places and met a lot of people, made conversations and learnt so many things on travelling and exploring Bali and more. It‚Äôs definitely worth it. "
snowges,112 contributions,Aug 2018,"Can't say I am an expert on Bali beaches but this is a nice beach. Not too crowded, no boats and a nice place to jump in.Awesome sunset...and isn't that what sets a beach aside?"
739Paul000,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2018,We went from Sanur to Seminyak initially for a couple days. it took 2 1/2 hours to get there its about 20ks. Check in to the medium priced city centre hotel which was ok? Then went for a walk on the beautiful beach NOT it was absolutely full of plastic right up to the high water mark. popped into a beachside hotel KU DE TA was the name. Talk about embarrassing. gangs of precocious teens spending rich daddies money on expensive drinks $20 a pop. Whilst teasing and laughing at the local beach hawkers. Needless to say we checked out the next day and went back to Sanur's pristine beaches and genuine people
CheshireIanc,Cheshire,Jul 2018,I found it impossible to swim due to the overwhelming plastic pollution in the sea. you were also battling with the surfers encroaching on the swimming area
Doubleo03,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Great busy beach but the water is a bit tough great for surfers Lots of great restaurants to choose from too 
Kiwi traveler,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Aug 2018,"Seminyak beach is a nice long sandy beach, you just have to get used to being hassled to purchase things, and being asked every couple of minutes. But it‚Äôs a great beach to relax on a lounger and read a book. Beach has huge swells so is great for surfing."
Jan L,"Ghent, Belgium",Aug 2018,"It was a visit not with friends but with adult kids ... but since that option did not show, I consider my kids to be friends. The beach is lovely. Large, windy, high waves, not too many people. Just the right place for a beach walk. Or a sunset picture. You do not go there for swimming or sun bathing."
Malarchy,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo",Jul 2018,"Seminyak Beach is a long strip of sand on Bali's west coast.  It is largely a yellow sand beach but not especially fine.  The waves are not huge but do much more than lap at the edges so the area attracts bodyboarders and the like.  The beach runs for quite a while so it is worth picking the right spot.  A good option is in front of Ku De Ta as it seems to be a bit cleaner than some other parts.  Sunbeds are available but are quite pricey, it is just as easy to use a towel instead.The beach does have a fair few people but nowhere near as many as crowd into Kuta.  This is not the leisure of isolation but equally is not overcrowded.Cleanliness is always an issue on Bali beaches but it isn't terrible.  Seminyak beach around Ku De Ta is in reasonable condition.There are hawkers on the beach but aside from being intrusive they are not overly aggressive.The beach itself is not ideal for sandcastle making but for splashing in the waves it is a really fun place."
Noel H,4 contributions,Aug 2018,Very nice sunsets.....great people and food..beach very nice for families and surfers......very close to hotel...so walking was easy..
G8814TXandrew,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"We found the beach to be dirty, & not an enjoyable experience, beaches outside resorts appear to be tidier"
Ankita A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,"Centrally located in bali, this beach is ok if you'd like to watch the sunset. However, it is quite crowded (mostly with Australians holidaying) and you would not be able to spend much time in water since seabed is really grainy. I even got grazed by a couple of pretty big stones while in water.One advantage is that it is situated right opposite Ku De Ta beach club so you can swim/ relax/ watch sunset/ drink/ eat all in a couple of hours."
Ccordo1,Montreal,Aug 2018,"Long coastline to walk along. Some areas have more waves than others. Unfortunately there is a bit of plastic litter as well.Lots of people, but you can find some quieter zones.You can easily find chairs and parasols to rent.Restaurants are nearby."
Ingrid T,12 contributions,Jul 2018,Great beach to sit and soak up the rays and atmosphere or watch the kite flying and people watch. Close to the shopping centre and great eateries. Good walk along beach to Double Six Beach or even further to Kuta Beach. 
John G,72 contributions,Aug 2018,"The beach itself is great, especially if after some waves....but it really needs looking after...I picked up broken glass on 2 occasions, and the amount of plastic waste coming on shore is a very sorry sight ...apart from myself and one family I saw picking the litter, I see no other effort generally...It‚Äôs all of us‚Äô problem and we need to take collective responsibility for it :-)"
Nigel M,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2018,A massive beach that gives you the best of everything. Areas around the bars tend to be busy but walk along the beach and you will find quieter areas. The beach was clean and the waves were good without being dangerous
Tomas141,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Very clean beach with good long views and nice fine sand. Swimming not really possible as it‚Äôs too rough and has strong rips. You can splash around in the waves though. 
Sanjeev Ohri,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018,spent a good time here with my child who is 5 years and he played so much with the sand. outlets are good and beach is very clean. no matter how much you play with the sand you never get it home as sand doesn't stick for long
adm12017,"London, UK",Aug 2018,"This is really quite a nice place to visit. I'd recommend getting here an hour before sunset, finding some bean bags at one of the beach bars and ordering some drinks and appetisers to watch the sunset.It's a nice vibe and most of the bars are either playing Balearic beats or have live acoustic musicians going on.It does get busy, but it's nicely chilled out and an enjoyable way to watch the sunset.There are lots of vendors walking past trying to sell you trinkets, but they aren't pushy and a gentle wave off sends them on to someone else.Plenty of places around for food and drink too."
Roger J,34 contributions,Jul 2018,Very very busy and vibe is great...lots to see and do. Try to stay close to the beach so that you can walk to the beach. Lots of cool bars along the beach.
David B,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2018,"I didn‚Äôt find much to enjoy at Seminyak Beach. Murky water, rubbish everywhere and crowds of people wandering around taking pictures of said water and rubbish.There‚Äôs a few beach clubs along the way which serve food and drinks to you while you sit on bean bags facing the water. Might be better if the view was good."
6419,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Nice clean beach, many options for light lunch and a beer on the beach. The restaurants have clean toilets, so a family day out is good. You can bargain for the sun beds and even book by the hr so don‚Äôt pay the initial asking price.Life guard on duty, watch out as the sea has a strong current."
Magdalena K,"Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka",Jul 2018,"If you‚Äôre surfing, but still learning how to catch a good wave, it might be interesting place for you. If you‚Äôre looking for white sand and crystal blue ocean, Seminyak won‚Äôt be amazing for you... nice for the sunset though."
Linda N,5 contributions,Jul 2018,Would be nicer if the hawkers left you alone .. they tend to hound you relentlessly .. maybe thats just part of Bali I dont enjoy
Richard S,"Leicester, UK",May 2018,"Lovely sandy beach however, there are stray dogs that roam free along the beach and do their business on the sand so you do have to be careful where you're walking... The beach is packed at around 6pm when the sunsets but when we went for a walk down the beach around 6:30ish there is a marge amount of litter that people leave behind, tourists and local people seem to thing it's ok to leave the bottles and plastics lying around for the tide to come in and wash it all out to sea. That was the disappointing this as we were expecting a beautiful beach which is was until sunset, it was just a shame that people couldn't do their bit to help keep it tidy too..."
brancolyn,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018,"This is Seminyak, it is busy and there is lots to look at.  The beach is not beautiful, and we did not swim here, although others were surfing.  You can see that it has rips, so be careful.  Lots going on here, great place to grab a drink at one of the restaurant/bars and watch the sunset.  Black sand, and a little polluted."
Lligla,"Walcha, Australia",Jul 2018,WE love being on Seminyak beach--waves are  huge so need to be careful and be sensible! It's great to walk along before breakfast or in evening. always quite a lot going on as well. Not so sure about the wet season though.
RobsterWirral,"Cheshire, UK",Jul 2018,What a truly charming place. The people are so friendly. The bars are great the health food shops amazing. Highly recommended for all ages!!!
Sid,"Navi Mumbai, India",Jul 2018,"Not might impressed with this beach , too crowded and not very clean , especially if you visit the other beaches in Bali "
David W,30 contributions,May 2018,When on holiday in the area we regularly met up with friends and family on this beach which is just wonderful - easy to get cheap beer and food on the beach or very nearby.  If in the area a must visit.
A Swede travels - √Ñmma,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2018,"Nice place, love it! Right now the waves are too big to swim in but still Nice to be at the beach anyway. "
Gill Smith,30 contributions,Jul 2018,Definitely visit double 6 beach. Day time. Sit and relax.  Night time. Spectacular views music great friendly atmosphere. It really is just amazing.
tim6091,"Vancouver, Canada",Jul 2018,"All the beaches we went to in Bali were quite dirty, there were people constantly cleaning, but so much plastic and garbage in the morning."
sammieb42018,"Ballina, Australia",Jul 2018,I live in a beautiful location in North Eastern NSW where we have beautiful beaches.  I didn't go to Seminyak for the beaches.  Nice to walk along and sunset dinner or drinks though.
bob764,Switzerland,Jul 2018,"A may sound like an old record but this beach is not what is used to be. Obviously a great place to spend the day since its so crowded. I you rent a surf board or body board make sure you rent an instructor with it, unless experimented. "
Rawinia H,"Bicton, Australia",Jul 2018,Loved the Beach at Night.. It‚Äôs amazing sitting there under the umbrellas with a bottle of wine and food...Great place to hang out and watch the sunset..
josephine,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,all the beaches in Bali are very beautifulSeminyak beach is located next to Double Six Beachhas its own beauty while enjoying the sunset
markhoman1962,"London, UK",Jul 2018,"This is truly a beautiful beach, on our current family holiday of SE Asia we hired a private villa very close to this beach. Myself and wife had a morning run each day along the beach, it was beautiful. After breakfast the whole family would go back to the beach for sea swimming and surfing, with the super soft sand this beach has everything. As with most beaches the terrible waste washed up on the beach was evident to see, however there were local groups who regularly worked in groups to clean the beach (well done to the locals doing your bit for the environment) "
Parabroad,"Portsmouth, UK",Jul 2018,"Arrived at the beach on our first night after dark, no idea or concept what lay in front of us! We ate at one of the beach places that had bean bags on the sand whilst we listened to the live music. Nice and sandy beach and seemed clean.Next morning we came back down to spend the day and were welcomed by the most amazing surf and sandy beach! Miles long with plenty of space.We hired a couple of sun beds (haggle- we got them down to 100,000 rupees for two for the whole day).Stay till the sun goes down, the colours are amazing!Watch out for the stray dogs though.Great beach."
Ralph S,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jul 2018,"Nice beach to surf and chill. Have some drinks at one of the beach clubs or even better, stay at one of the 5 Star hotels and enjoy the beautiful sunsets."
escapewithkitty,"Western Australia, Australia",Jul 2018,kites snax sunset surf offer of massage and sarongs galore... sunset is the best time to grab a local snack as home chefs head sown to catch the locals & families as the enjoy the sun going down 
jackie77w,"Coventry, UK",Jul 2018,We went to the beach for the stunning sunsets and located ourselves at the Potato Head Beach Club. Extremely clean but many pedlars which is off putting
Skin197,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Sat on loungers under an umbrella cost was IRD 150,000 included a bogey board. Annoying people trying to sell you stuff like bow and arrows, fake watches, hats, kites, sarong. Smell from nearby river awful! Safe beach for swimming compared with Canggu and white not black sand "
MeryemBagis,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2018,"Best beach in Kuta, sunset is wonderful, very clean area. At night, there will be enjoyable parties at the beach."
Neil D,459 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach has a good selection of bars at the top of the beach. These bars put out bean bags for sunset. The food at these bars is a bit higher prices than off the beach.There are plenty of sun beds available anytime of year, even more at high season. The sunbed sellers also rent surf/boogie boards and give surging lessons.A direct route to Seminyal beach is down Jalan Campung Tandak. "
virtueleighanne,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Something to remember , sitting in the bean bags on the beach amongst hundreds , watching the sun go down. "
BillyTokyoist,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2018,"If any chance to stay beach side at bali for surfing , shopping , enjoying world cuisines that I believe Seminyak is best area to stay... can find quite or noise at around and walking relax less then kuta area..."
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2018,"Lots of bars, restaurants and clubs along this stretch of beach. A good place to have a few drinks or dinner while watching the sun go down."
krenaningtyas,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2018,Ambience is different from Kuta Beach. This beach is located in the luxurious Seminyak area which is offered a new style of enjoying Bali beaches. 
Laura199472,"England, UK",Jul 2018,"The beach goes on forever, its very clean, the sea is warm and very wavey - too strong even for surfing throughout our visit. With very strong currants also.Price of sunbeds vary along the beach, and there are not many places to get onto the beach from the road.The beach isn't crowded in terms of people sitting on it, but there are always hundreds of people walking along the beach. "
Around the World,"Berlin, Germany",Jul 2018,This part of a long strip isn‚Äôt so developed even the beach road is full of branded shops nobody needs. We came across of one of the beach clubs and had a break for a drink. There are only tourists sitting with a smartphone and taking selfies and staring on it. Creepy & funny at the same time. They pay a lot of money to fly thousands of miles and end up in one of the beach club with their smartphones. I feel it‚Äôs so boring and after the drink we left. So Seminyak beach is more for overdressed tourists which forget to shop at home or believe that branded stuff is cheaper here. And along the beach is like a canal. Very smelly and not nice. 
_richnolivia,"Wairarapa, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Seminal beach is very clean.  The people that sell goodies on the beach are Lovely they take no for an answer.Visit Sally or Kites they will make up brackets and necklaces to suit you.Security guards are very friend along with Balinese people always smiling.BEAUTIFUL sunsets to see. 
Colincfc,"Maidstone, UK",Jul 2018,"Loungers on beach pretty expensive 300000 for 5 hours prepare to haggle as they start around 600000, turtle came ashore near us which made our day prepare to be hassled all day by sellers generally the same ones you told 5 mins previous,  "
Teresa M,16 contributions,Jul 2018,We really enjoyed the beach at the Ku De Ta end and really loved Ku De Ta and the facilities. Would definitely go back.
Logan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2018,Clean beach . Beside kuta square. Alot of dining areas. Beach activities.. good waves for surfing . You are able to rent a surf board
rahulladhad,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2018,A nicw beach. Unless nusa Dua beach which is white sand beach this beach is a black sand beach. A great place to learn surfing and located near to market area. Best time to visit is early morning by 8:30.
srmurray2015,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Lovely beach lots of lounges for hire. Plenty of great little bars for Lowe cost eats and  drinks . Becareful in the surf it gets very big and rough . Nice spot to watch the sunset with a beer or cocktail 
Brian A,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018,Great place to get away from the bustle have a cold beer and watch the sunset. Not too crowded compared to Kuta. Lots of places to get cold drinks good prices and many types of food available also good prices. Easy enough to walk to the beach from many hotels or a cheap taxi ride.
Sunny C,"Sunbury, Australia",Jul 2018,"Beautiful sunsets with friendly locals.We stayed at the Breezes Resort & Spa which was in short walking distance to Seminyak Beach.  The beach is lovely to walk along, but I wasn't enticed to swim.  My husband ticked off his bucket list item to learn surfing.You can hire a shaded deck chair for 50,000IDR - depending on your negotiating skills this could be for a couple of hours or a whole day (depending on demand as well!)Great beach for long walks as you can stop for refreshment at plenty of places along the way."
Gokul M,"Toronto, Canada",Jul 2018,Found that the beach was not overcrowded. Overall quite neat. Enough vendors around if you want to grab a bite or drink. Had a great time at the beach. Waves were quite intense which made the experience all the more enjoyable. 
rnbstone,"Zushi, Japan",Jun 2018,"My family and I wandered to the beach via Ku De Ta and paid for a couple of chairs, umbrella, and boogie boards (I think we paid 150,000).  There were not many people on the beach, as it was a weekday and it was later in the afternoon.  If you go, expect to be hassled by the wandering vendors.  I must have been asked 20 times if I wanted to buy a watch, sarong, kite, get a massage, or have my hair braided.  It gets annoying when you're trying to close your eyes and rest.  While the beach looks nice, the smell is more of a port a potty.  I kept looking for canals of water pushing raw sewage into the ocean, because that's what it smells like.  My whole family noticed it, and eventually we left - not staying for sunset because the smell was just terrible."
Cams R,290 contributions,May 2018,"I‚Äôm more of a white-sand-beach-kind-of-girl but I actually enjoyed seminyak beach. It‚Äôs a surfer‚Äôs haven I guess. Coz of the waves. Good ones. I found the sand a bit glittery and shiny (though it‚Äôs brown/dark) so I enjoyed walking, enjoying the sun and the wind. It‚Äôs not too crowded compared to Kuta. A lot of people offering umbrellas and beach/lounge chairs but it‚Äôs pricey and you pay per hour. I suggest you bring a mat or beach towels instead of paying for those chairs. "
Alex27,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Send is volcanic, sea is wild and not good for swimmers. You are better to stay in resort and just look into the water. Good for walking and you can jump into many different beach clubs for a drink. "
Paul F,"St Peters, Australia",Jul 2018,"Wandered down for a few hours on the beach with the family. Nice surf, clean with lots of beds and sun lounges quite cheap. Not too many people bothering you for cheap trinkets either."
Ani C,52 contributions,Jul 2018,clean.  good sand and surf.  location is good and parking for scooter.  food handy. hawkers leave you alone.  recommend. 
Adam S,12 contributions,Jul 2018,"Brilliant large fine sandy beach where you can come to see the famous sunsets. Though you can swim, the waves make it conducive for surfing. Great for people watching as you relax with a drink in one of the bars or sun lounge hire spots. Great to just walk too."
EricaAnders,10 contributions,Jul 2018,"Lovely wide beach but can get crowded, quite a few people trying to sell you all kinds of products and/or services. "
Feevh,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2018,"Best sunset of Bali! Many different restaurants with good food! We could even watch WK matches on a big screen on the beach! You can rent sun beds and parasols! Furthermore, you can rent surfboards and get surf lessons! It‚Äôs a lovely beach and it‚Äôs haves everything! "
Shauna F,40 contributions,Jul 2018,Quieter than the main beach if you go north. Plenty of offers of sunbeds and more willing to negotiate. Cafes nearby and a lovely evening vibe with bean bags on the beach!
Dhugh70,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2018,The beach is great for walking along. It us windy which makes it pleasant. I did venture in for a dip but I came out stinking. This may have something to do with sewage system near the beach. There are many hotel restaurants to stop and have a drink or meal.
Krista D,"Gaborone, Botswana",Jun 2018,"I have been coming to Bali on Business for years and one of the trip's highlights is the blissful moments where I can walk the Seminyak beach! Although the sand is not white but more volcanic black it is not as black as other beaches in Bali.  I enjoy the short motor bike ride to the beach where I park it. I then walk for about 45 minutes towards Batu Belig Beach where I dine at Warung Pantai, a superb and very reasonably priced beach restaurant. I enjoy the sunset there, usually order grilled Mahi Mahi with Salad and steamed rice or vegetables spring rolls, fresh squeezed lime juice, have a great cup of Bali Coffee before heading back by night towards Legian beach. At night there are very few people on the beach, it is cool and all the night lights of all the beach venues are so pretty.  The authorities/ residents have really cleaned up the beach a lot and this year I witnessed very little litter in spite of the fact that by day there are people in abundance. Walking the beach at different times you will see the hoards of sunbathers by day, resident expats walking their dogs, children playing, oldies walking, local balinese with their families, people making offerings, people doing yoga, brides and grooms having photo shoots on horseback or in the waves....you will see so much as you walk this beach.  Depending on the time of the day the sea will also have a different beauty...sometimes calm & blue, in the evening navy blue with golden  reflections of the sunset, all the spray of the rolling waves catching the beautiful sundown rays."
605jacintam,7 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach along the Anantara stretch is quieter, less crowded. You can walk for miles with the waves just kissing your feet and the wind blowing. Not much bother here from people peddling their wares."
coralreef59,"Berkhamsted, UK",Jun 2018,"Seminyak beach is probably one of the best I have ever seen. There is miles of golden sand and clear blue water.It seems to be quite popular for surf boarding and we saw people having lessons.There are quite a lot of beach clubs spread out along the beach all serving food and drinks. We ate and had drinks at a very relaxing beach club (the name escapes me) which was on 'potato head' beach. There were bean bags parasols, a small swimming pool with a children's area and a dining area. This place was so chilling, it was hard to leave.The sunsets on this beach are beautiful."
ferspratt,"Seattle, WA",May 2018,"Walked to this beach everyday while in Bali. Visited during early morning for less crowded, but sunset was a great time to visit and share a cocktail."
Wish M,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"Bali my favorite place on this earth, I‚Äôm feeling so happy and relax, take your time and have a great holiday"
Marlucia2015,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jul 2018,"I liked the food very much and the waitress kartika is so nice , it‚Äôs a really good Indonesian food."
Sean H,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"I tried hard to ignore the plastic Bags, rubbish and pollution but there‚Äôs so much. The locals just don‚Äôt seem to care which is such a shame.Apart from that it‚Äôs a good place, there‚Äôs bars for Africa in the Legian area and overall it‚Äôs a good spot. I just wish the local govt would clean it up!!! "
RachelIddon,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2018,"Great waves, huge pull out to sea though so you have to be really careful with younger children. Cheap rental of sun loungers and surf boards. One warning if you buy anything from one of the beach seller's do it from a fixed one (there's plenty of little stalls) other wise they will all not leave you alone, we felt quite harassed at one point and we just all got in the sea to hide lol!! "
Just Sonia P,"Isle of Man, UK",Jul 2018,"a little cafe 20 min walk from beach , i thought name was Canteen as the wifi password was this. its not the clean canteen restaurant its a small wooden seating area cafe. lady run it she from Tawain, she stole from us & over charged 3 times the actual.priceworst place in seminyak so AVOID here or youl be robbed. cafe is within the streets on my upload"
Dolo999,Solugh,Jul 2018,Great beach for activities like surfing. A lot of boards to rent and teachers who can show you surfing. Not expensive. Great bars and restaurants where you can hide if you have enough of sun and buy some cold drinks and cocktails. Great place for sunset view and chilling with live music every night. Really highly recommended. 
Lily S,5 contributions,Jul 2018,"A highlight of my trip to Bali would have to be having sunset drinks on Seminyak Beach. The live music, comfy beanbags and good location are amazing. The beach has an assortment of restaurants catering for everyone.The beach itself is quite nice. The surf is popular and many tourists hire day beds on the beach. I would recommend a visit to Seminyak Beach!"
romerroow,18 contributions,Jul 2018,Pay for 50k for long chair seing sunset is not expensive at all..Love the beach!! Can do menicure and hair do with local people üòä
donliew,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2018,"The entrance of this beach is right next to Ku De Ta Club. Rental of twin deck chairs is Rp. 100,000 for 1 hour or Rp. 150,000 for 2 hours."
sssssssk,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2017,Nice beach to walk.  Some people do surf and body board.  Water is gray.  Lots of seller come but don‚Äôt bother once refused.
Zoe W,"Birmingham, UK",Jul 2018,This is the perfect place to watch the sun go down. It is very popular with locals and tourists alike and you can see why. It is clean and very pleasant and perfect for a stroll
Lovise S,17 contributions,Jul 2018,Good for chilling on the beach while enjoying the sun. The water was cold and a lot of waves. Close to some good restaurantes and the shops
Frida A,6 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach is a one of the best beaches in Bali. The beach is one of the cleanest in Bali so the water is good not slot of garbage in the water! Nice waves and good for beginner surfers. The negative thing is that some of the people who wanna rent sun beads (especially the ones near the entrance to the beach) will try to take over prices like 100 k for one sun bead but if you walk a bit further you can get one for 50 k. There are also people who will try to sell things to you, some of them are nice and will take no for an answer and some won't and can get rude and nasty with you (especially men who try selling you paintings, don't know why)."
Andrew C,"Geelong, Australia",Jul 2018,"OK, you're in Bali, of course you want to visit the beach. Well, once you've arrived and ""experienced"" the local culture (ie the incessant touting for business by every stall-holder, vendor, taxi, massage parlour and anything else that can make a dollar, you might think the beach offers a degree of solace. Think again. You are accosted by sun-lounge and umbrella renters, surf lessons and personal services, some of a VERY intimate nature and all along a beach that whilst comprising of sand that is, in places, blacker than most (after all, this is a volcanic island), does contain a fair amount of rubbish, so watch your step!"
Daniel J,15 contributions,Jul 2018,"Visited the beach all most each day , it‚Äôs a great place to relax and unwind or go for a long stroll, you can also learn to surf which for someone who has never tried was a bonus. This is not the type of beach you would expect as it is a surf beach and the waves are quite high but it was impressive seeing the surfers catch wave after wave. There are places to eat along the beach but never tried any so can not really comment on them.  We used the beach to walk back to our hotel fromBoth Kuta and Seminyak square .The down side was lots of dogs running wild doing what dogs do and lots of hawkers selling souvenirs but guess they are only trying to make a living. "
Phil B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Two streams pouring their fetid bile onto the beach makes you think twice about going for a swim. And then there is the rubbish, plastic, dropped and ignored. While hotel staff meticulously sweep  fallen leaves, plastic chaos reigns but metres from their doors.  Change will only come when tourists fly over Bali or the powerful demand change"
MichelleESydney,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018,This visit to Bali we found the water clean and as usual and beach user friendly we as a family had surfers and a young child so we used the beach to surf morning walks and runs along the beach 
Sandy851,"North Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Unfortunately this volcanic ash beach is terrible. There is dirt flowing down tiny little streams from building sites to the ocean. The ocean itself is not clean and if you happen to put your toes in and think the water looks clean, just view it from on high from a hotel room and you will see the pollution. The surf is dangerous with huge currents."
Luke T,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2018,"This beach is out of this world. Stunning views, clean, great selection of sun beds which are also reasonably priced. Only beach we visited in Bali simply for the fact we were so in love the moment we found it."
SMYTHTRIBE,"Perth, Australia",May 2018,We always at least once a trip visit the beach for a late afternoon walk! Generally the tide is out and it‚Äôs less busy. The kids love looking for hermit crabs and splashing about in the shallows.This trip the beach was cleaner than we‚Äôve ever seen and we got watch a beautiful wedding. Plenty of places to grab a beanbag and a drink and meal! 
goddessofwisdom,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2018,The water was clear the weather beautiful. So many fish and crabs and water pools. A delight to relax.  
Rajesh C,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jun 2018,"For someone from Chennai, this beach wasn‚Äôt something to write home about. Pretty small beach. Short walk to the sea. Can become dirty. Didn‚Äôt seem like a place for offshore activities - these are in other places in Bali. OK for just relaxing and sitting in the sand. Quite frankly, found nothing of interest in the beach. Which is both good and bad in its own ways. "
Ellac10,"West Yorkshire, UK",Jun 2018,"The beach is huge, so it doesn‚Äôt feel crowded even when it‚Äôs busy. However, the sea is very choppy and not recommended for swimming in! Good for surfers and some nice restaurants!"
paceinyourface,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2018,"Tepid Indian ocean crashing onto the long sandy beach, always a pleasure.  Sure it's busy, but it's fun and relaxed.  Plenty to do and to look at.  Need to be a little mindful of the rip ...but it's well marked.  A great, fun and safe beach!"
Sonica A,55 contributions,Jun 2018,Wish there were shacks with food and drinks... we could spent longer time there. It is possibly the most beautiful beach we saw!
Vlad GR,"Chisinau, Moldova",Jun 2018,"I saw the pictures and reviews for this beach which in reality is nothing like this, it‚Äôs and average beach and if you will get lucky you will be able to swim, i was unlucky, good for surfers."
sabrina s,18 contributions,Jun 2018,beach drink sun nice vibes... all in one place: seminyak! you find the best hotel and place to eat there and wide nice beach. each restaurant has a very comfy puff chair where you can order food drink or only chill! they put some nice music around 5 that makes everything more exciting .i loved it!
jtaylor946,"Guangzhou, China",Jun 2018,"We came here a few times during our 6 day stay in Seminyak. It‚Äôs a great place to relax and watch the sunset. I enjoyed body surfing here as the waves get pretty big and the current is strong. However, you need to be careful; especially if you are not a strong swimmer. My boyfriend ended up in the hospital after nearly drowning when he went body surfing. "
Vickster,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jun 2018,"Not the best beach I've ever seen, but it was a great place to watch the sunset. The beach is a hive of activity during the day with beach chairs and umbrellas as far as the eye can see, surfing lessons, beach bars and beach sellers. If you like walking do yourself a favour and walk along the beach to Legian rather than taxi. It far quicker and way more pleasant üòé"
kaiwen_leow,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2018,Absolutely gorgeous during sunset. Just be there at least half an hour before so you‚Äôve ample time to take photos of the sun setting plus do some shopping from the peddlers at the beach - some lovely necklaces and bracelets.
Geir P,3 contributions,Jun 2018,This is the right place to be if you need good food and a drink or more üëçA lot of bags to relaxe on too
483paulan,"Illovo, South Africa",Oct 2017,Wonderful place to rest and relax after an emotional journey to Jakarta and other sites in Bali. Found a nice spot and rented and all-day bed at the beach to rest and relax with a good book.  Food comes to you and the beauty parlours as well. But it is never when you want to have their services. Quite annoying to have vendors hoovering around you until you purchase something and they are happy to leave. But others follow.... 
Pennart,"Dunbogan, Australia",Jun 2018,"Seminyak beach is littered with trash. We went here to beach comb and walk what we hoped was a beautiful Balinese beach. Within metres of stepping onto the beach you are surrounded by plastic of every type,dead animals, syringes and all manner of garbage.  What humans have done to this place is shameful and dangerous. I'd gladly pay a little more in an entry tax if it to be used to clean the beaches. Do not go and certainly don't take children to the beach. "
janehJ1516EJ,2 contributions,Jun 2018,Great barbe corn and Bintang.  Nice walk on beach taco van outside flash hotel.quieter than legian and easier to walk to through nice shops
mnicolas,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"The beach is nice if you like sandy beaches that don‚Äôt dive off into the deep end too soon! It‚Äôs a good long stretch of about 5 or 6KM making it ideal to make long beach walks on.It is however incredibly busy and polluted here and there where you see dirty water coming from inland go out to see on a few spots near Canggu and Seminyak too.It makes it not so nice to swim in unless you are a long wat out from the pour out points, it smells there too!The water and the waves are very nice though to boogie board or surf on. For swimming be careful with the strong currents as they can be deceptive. You will see red flags with do not swim advice and it‚Äôs best to heed them.Lounging and relaxing on the many caf√©‚Äôs and bars along the beach is particularly nice close to sunset!"
veronika papp,"Chichester, UK",Jun 2018,"nice beach which was short walk from our villa, i saw that you can rent chairs or cabanas and buy drink, the waves are quite big and we prefared the beach club"
Zannaone,21 contributions,Jun 2018,"This was the best spot for enjoying the water.The sand was pure and the beach was clean, but a bit crowded.We absolutely loved the water here. Small, but intense waves makes it great fun in the water for playing, swimming or even surfing.So far this is one of the best beaches we've seen in Bali.The beach is pretty lively, if you don't like the crowds, you won't enjoy it."
PPranav1980,49 contributions,Jun 2018,"Gets v crowded at times. Post 10 am is betterMany surfing schools - didn't try this time but on my list for next tripThe F&B on beach is avg, better to go elsewhere"
matsa58,"Sollentuna, Sweden",Apr 2018,Several good places to eat and drink on the beach. Several excellent hotels with different type of services to be used. Service people cleaning the beach all day long.
Claire R,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2018,"Visited for a special birthday.Beach is fab, the waves are great fun. The traffic in Seminyak is unrelenting, whatever the time there is coming start flurry of scooters and cars through the narrow streets which makes journeys long.The people are friendly everywhere and all times felt very safe. Lots to see and do and as everywhere is resonably priced all the family can participate in lots of activities. If you want a relaxing holiday though this isn‚Äôt the area to stay!!!! "
tanveer1987,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jan 2018,We went to this beach around evening time. The beach looked deserted and not particularly clean. We spent 10-15 mins here and returned. The journey back was fun as the entire stretch has eateries and massage parlors
ikhajuria,"Udhampur, India",Jan 2018,"Excellent beach to be ..!!! Must goNice and comfy sunbeds ,Good waves to surf .January was a perfect month to be their..."
Nancy S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,One of the nicest beach to visit in Bali. Good place to chill while waiting for sunset with many cafes near the beach.
widyalin,"Mildura, Australia",Jun 2018,"Either just sitting all day on the beach or going there specially to watch sunset,you might want to bring a book with you to make it much better. love it"
jean_leemans,"Antwerp, Belgium",May 2018,Every night the beach was very crowded. The sunset is wonderful.At day it's a surfer's paradise. Loved that beach!
Heather J,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018,We stayed for 2 weeks 12 minutes walk away from the beach at Kudeta Beach Club. Each time we came out on the beach it did not cease to amaze. We walked in the shallows most mornings and evenings and it was clean....so much cleaner than the very public beach of Kuta (Legian) which we did once at the end of our stay. In Seminyak there seem to be more expatriates who live in the area and try to keep this beach clean. One would see them walking along picking up bits of rubbish (not that there ever was that much to pick up). I enjoyed the beach at low and high tide and anywhere in between. Also the beach sellers (which we met near sunset) are a friendly bunch.
matthewoliver0101,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"Seminyak beach is unlike any other beach. It is clean, and well taken care of, and there were many unique places to go to enjoy the view of the sea."
223jennim,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"It is a lovely beach for a stroll of a evening, it is not so crowded and always a friendly face. it is a beautiful beach."
brandon_hughes,"San Francisco, CA",May 2018,"Even with a little rain one morning it was great to people watch before or after it is crowded.  Some friendly faces, playful dogs, horizon views and a gentle breeze are all par of the enjoyment."
AndrewYew,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2018,The beach is beautiful but increasingly there is more trash. Generally there is less touts here than Kuta Beach. There are more and more restaurants at the beach nowadays.
Tim M,"Wakefield, UK",Jun 2018,"A great beach for a long walk! Spoiled a little by litter is some places (and the odd broken bottle) but a great beach for walking, paddling or just sitting and sunbathing. Some places to try out surfing and overall the beach is reasonably quiet"
Shirley6352016,"Birmingham, UK",May 2018,"We visited this beach twice and, while it was good for sunbathing, the waves were very strong so we were not able to swim. It was great for surfers !"
xilouie,"London, UK",Jun 2018,We are appalled at the lack of respect that people have for what drives people to Bali island in the first place.  My wife and I spent 3 hours picking up debris of the beach rather than swimming.  We found syringes / diapers/ plastic bottles / wrappers/straws etc...  A young lady was sunbathing next to a dead rat and didn‚Äôt even know it.  I hope that tourist and locals can all leave the beach in better care than when they arrive.  It‚Äôs a beautiful place but needs tighter controls in managing this national treasure!  
ultimatelife1,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2018,"We love coming to this beach, as it is quieter, not so many hookers!  Good lounges to rent.  Fantastic beach, one of the most popular.  Absolutely amazing sun sets."
Nancy S,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2018,Walks by the beach here is a must! And don't miss out the beautiful sunsets. They are the most beautiful sunsets that I have ever seen. 
eatsleeptraveller,"Central Russia, Russia",Jun 2018,"Nice beach for swim and relax with white sandy, cool for sunset. A lots of restaurants and hotel surrounding to visit and stay. Worth to visit and so fresh air"
Akil H,"London, UK",Jun 2018,"Really nice beach, you pretty much have to order and pay for a sun bed to enjoy though because the sand isn't deep enough to lay a towel down on"
Junteng 63,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2018,"We rent a tent with 2 chairs and the price are 300k IDR. We manage to nego it to 150k IDR. Beach with nice view and windy. In Bali , u have to visit the beach"
Intoshmac,"Maitland, Australia",May 2018,Nice clean beach. Not overcrowded . Lots of restaurants to get food or drinks. Lots of umberellas and lounges for only $10 a day. Great value . Not many sellers on the beach.
JoaoG-Bali,Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo-Guerrero,May 2018,"Amazing cocktails at the beach and seeing people walking by at sunset time. The vibes here are amazing, you can def feel the happiness in people!"
Leanne K,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2018,"Loads of places to eat and drink along the beach, most places have free wifi. The surf is rough, the beach is clean! Some people say its dirty but Ive been told it may look like that because of the black sand. Great spot to eatch the sunset at 6pm."
Jessica C,11 contributions,Apr 2018,"Hawkers aren't too aggressive here, and while vendors have established price cartels, you can knock 5,000 rupiah (about 50 Aussie cents) off a 30,000 beer on the sand."
Paul S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2018,Great beach for walking running in the morning. There is not much chance of getting a good walk or run on the pavements in Seminyak. But this beach provides great access to a run to Kuta(10km) turnaround. Just be prepared to get your feet wet
supneet,"Manchester, UK",May 2018,"Nice food, loud music... only till 12pm, food served till 12pm. But they do allow u to enjoy the beach on their sandbags till whenever u want .... fresh air and the night beach walk is what I loved about Bali "
Jenny S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"A very huge beach with white sands that easy for swimming or just walking along. Lots of sitting area for rent paid to the locals, no place to change or clean up though. The best way is to stay at hotels that offer beach club and shuttle, or even better in front of the beach"
TMBom,"Mumbai, India",May 2018,"After The Jimbaran, Seminyak was the next best beach we experienced. As I mentioned earlier also that if you plan to stay in Seminyak you must stay at the beach front or close to the beach. It is a very lively area , shopping pubs and restaurants: nice place the stay and move around "
David F,38 contributions,May 2018,"A bit dirty and overcrowded. Came here for a long walk and to watch the sunset on a beachbag. If you're staying in Seminyak, I recommend coming for one day but then hiring a driver to take you to other prettier, cleaner beaches. "
sofy,Indonesia,Mar 2018,Best beach with wonderful sunset. Me and friend enjoy the sunset at la panca which is good and delicious food
The Anxious Traveller,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2018,"Seminyak beach is a nice beach but not amazing by any means. Expect black sand though . You can get cheap cold bintang from the guys at the top and rent beach chairs for 100,000 rupiah . There are many sellers up and down the beach . Wasn‚Äôt to busy in the month of May . "
Alyshia L,"York, UK",May 2018,Lovely beach but you can not swim on most of it. Sea is generally quite rough and dangerous. Lots of people selling things such as fake glasses and bags. Lots of little huts to purchase drinks. 
Disha V,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jan 2018,"Not your typical ""relaxing"" beach. It's a typical city beach. Pricy, dirty but with good dining options."

Graeme R,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",May 2018,Great place to finish the day.Plenty of entertainment and characters. Sunsets are postcard quality.Plenty of options from blankets to bean bags or day beds to relax on  with drinks and friends.  
JojoBreda,"Breda, The Netherlands",May 2018,Beaches are not the most beautiful in Bali but for sunset it's a must do to sit on one of the many bean bags and watch the sunset.Bit cloudy yesterday
PratikDShah,mumbai,May 2018,One of the good beaches on the offer in Bali while they have many. overall the beach is good to hangout during the day expecially for the couple.
Emma Hamel,"Montreal, Canada",May 2018,"A lot of bar and restaurants around beach side, good place to see the sunset and have a beach walk, different than Kuta beach that has to many vendors, must visit while in Seminyak Bali."
Evyenia W,30 contributions,May 2018,We tried to catch a sunset but it wasn‚Äôt much- the kids had fun running along the beach! Lots of cool restaurants and bars. 
AzianMatey,"Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Philippines",Apr 2018,Seminyak Beach is a long stretch of grey sandy beach situated in an upscale and private neighbourhood thats famous for its fabulous sunsets....
spuggy_10,"Peterlee, UK",Oct 2017,"beach is not the  cleanest, water can be very rough, but warm when you can use it, no facilities on beach for food/drink etc but can be bought not too far away."
Travelswithmyfriends,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,I had read the reviews for Seminyak beach but was pleasantly surprised. The water was lovely to swim in although caution is needed as the waves can be quite strong and only a small section is partrolled. Beach beds and umbrellas can be hired and cold drinks also on offer at reasonable prices. Most of the sun beds belong to the upmarket hotels along the beach.  A few hawkers but they are not particularly aggressive. The sand was clean and free of litter. The occasional horse rider along the foreshore is a real treat. Beautiful place to pass the time and watch the sunset. 
Debbie O,9 contributions,May 2018,Lovely well kept beach with lots of amenities.  Sunbed hire cheaper if u walk up to double six part of beach. 
CazzieCakes,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2018,"Asia and Seminyak Beach in this instance is drowning in plastic and it is disturbing as it is disgraceful.If your happy to swim amongst plastic straws, food wrappers, plastic tubes from toothpaste to skin bleaching cream I could not recommend this beach highly enough:( Bali has lost it for me as the pollution is now out of control.The lack of infrastructure and us bargain hunting holiday hounds have taken its toll.I‚Äôve been going to Bali for 30 years and seen it go from sublime to submerged.What a shame :( "
Imogen S,14 contributions,May 2018,"I prefer being here in the late afternoon/evenings, just to sit and watch the world go by, happy on a beanbag, I also bought some cute treats from sellers here! I didn‚Äôt swim, but it‚Äôs just so relaxed. My fave location on the beach is the b9b bar :)"
KenSSnavely,"Los Angeles, CA",May 2018,"Seminyak Beach is great for walking in either direction. Surf lessons, not crowded, great photo opportunities, the Bali clouds as a back drop. And sunsets are a time for people to gather and take lots of photos. "
David S,"Bendigo, Australia",May 2018,Plenty of places to eat or you can just stroll the beach and watch the sunset. Plenty of hawkers trying to sell you many things that you possibly don't need but it adds to the atmosphere. Visit the beach for a sunset if you have the time.
friedrice4,"Paynesville, Australia",May 2018,"Spent 7 days in the area, we enjoyed Legian beach much better, more lounges, friendlier bar owners, music playing with much better atmosphere. Seminyak beach had darker sand than Kuta and Legian and also had fresh water drains flowing into the sea, this may be the reason for the darker sand. Much more enjoyable at Legian and only a short walk down the beach."
Baz M,"Calgary, Canada",May 2018,We stayed at the Marriott which was very good but the streets are busy and noisy. The restaurants are a bit rough but down on the beach is really nice.The peddlers get really tiresome.We won't go back to Seminyak but at least we saw it and it was good way to start to our 3 week vacation. Go to Ubud instead.
Riggerswollongong,"Wollongong, Australia",May 2018,The beach itself is quite littered with cigarette bits and general rubbish. It's a great location with plenty of bars and restaurants right in the beach and a really good vibe. 
Dinks599,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"Great beach for all of the family if you like waves , which my 3 kids do. Plenty of  sun lounges to chose from for a cheap price.Don't pay anymore then IDR100,000 for two lounge beds. That's about Aud $10.00 ( Aud$5.00 each lounge.)Cool drinks not far away and plenty of shopping options passing you by ( literally üòÉ).  Sandy beach and very clean.They also have flags set up showing were its safe to swim."
Peter,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",May 2018,"It is a beach.The sea is most of the times to dangerous to swim in.Surfing yes.A lot of trendy places to have a drink, lay down, some have a pool.Very nice warungs for local food, not expensive.Popular is watching the sunset.Sitting on the beach on a beanbag. "
xrs1976,"Hobart, Australia",May 2018,Went to Potato Head beach club and watched the sunset. Drinks were about average Australian price. Great atmosphere! 
Rod P,"Redcliffe, Australia",May 2018,"Whilst the sand is not pure white by any means, this beach is cleaned daily and all rubbish (if any) removed. Deck chairs abound, and when the surf is ‚Äúup‚Äù, it is ideal for surfing."
Stanleyctan,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2018,The beach is too busy and crowded. Prefer Nusa dua & jimbaran better. Tried the water sports and that was it. 
Christine G,"Deux-Sevres, France",Apr 2018,Long stretch of good sand.  Sea is not generally recommended for swimming due to the surf waves but there are some safer areas under surveillance. Fabulous sunsets .
Joslyn Gardiner,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2018,"The beach at Seminyak is black sand, small waves and lots of rips.  However, it is an amazing place to watch the sun go down, to sip on a cocktail or two or simply lounge around on a very comfortable bean bag.  You have to visit, so go between 4 and 7pm... the most action and great for people watching! "
Oldboganbull,"Pambula, Australia",May 2018,"Very safe surf beach, clean by Bali standards but water quality not the best. A great place to watch the sunset whilst enjoying a cold and very cheap Bintang from a bean bag and having a neck and foot massage. The street / beach sellers are everywhere but not too aggressive and it‚Äôs fun to barter with them ( you can offer low prices without offending them) and sometimes pick up a real bargain. If you frequent the same ‚Äúhosts‚Äù on a regular basis they will treat you like royalty and remember you for years. Certainly safe for all the family."
blue_wahine,"Redondo Beach, CA",May 2018,"When you walk through the entrance, past the parking area, and over the bridge, there are women who try to sell sarongs and bracelets.  I have no use for both, so I did not purchase any.There was even a man selling canvas unframed paintings for 800,000 Rupiah, which he claimed he painted and ‚Äúused to have a shop‚Äù in Seminyak, but he sold it.  Beautiful beach to watch the waves, and lay out.  I rented a beach chair and umbrella for 50,000 Rupiah ($3.50 USD) which was a deal, as when I was in the Caribbean, the Beach Chair and Umbrella rental was $25 USD and you must order expensive food off their Menu, like a $15 cocktail and $25 hamburger, so this was a bargain.I was there about 11:00am, with hardly anyone on the beach.  An hour before Sunset, many people were coming to the beach. Kids playing soccer on the sand. Everyone there to watch the sunset.  I probably had about 3 different vendors come up to try to sell, but none were persistent. I politely said no, and they walked away.Beautiful Sunset views."
Tambonz,"Waipu, New Zealand",May 2018,However the street hawkers on the beach do spoil it a bit .... Beer ? Chair? Jewellery? Sunglasses? Rings ? etc
GeoffC5,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2018,"The beach sand is grey with dirt, but still really popular at sunset, with the beach crowded, especially on the week-end and around Full Moon time"
Lindsay P,"Tauranga, New Zealand",May 2018,"A large expansive beach which has a very gentle gradient into the sea. Excellent for families to swim or those that do not like large wave activity. Can get very busy with many holiday makers enjoying the area. Lots of people surfing ( or trying to ) which was at time a good laugh. The beach was relatively clean with very little rubbish which was pleasing to see. The hawkers weren't bad, a few of them, but no trouble. A very good beach to relax at."
Nat C,28 contributions,Mar 2018,"Walked off a hangover whilst my friend slept hers off!! Very nice clean beach. I didn‚Äôt get harassed much by the sellers, there were lots of surf lessons available, restaurants and bars were set slightly back from the beach so as to not ruin the peace! "
Sara L,"Leamington Spa, UK",May 2018,"It's a beach, it is clean and ad you'd expect has a good selection of lounger for the day. 50,000 seems to be the going rate. Some do towel hire too.The hawkers are there but not intrusive.  You will pay a bit of a premium for drinks the closer you are to the big hotels but the warungs rather than the beach huts offer better value and reasonable food. Try cantina to the right of W. Has a decent toilet too.Watch the current, it is strong and swim only where there is a lifeguard.  "
Di B,26 contributions,May 2018,"It is lovely being near the beach and viewing it from restaurant decks etc but I did not like being on the beach so much. We are spoilt in Australia, beautiful white sand so the dark colour was a little strange. I did not enjoy swimming as there was quite a bit of rubbish in the water"
Gary B,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,nice beach to chill and plenty of places to get a drink or food . water sometimes a bit rough but clean and surf ok if thats what you want or hire surf boards even lessons available 
ShellsBellz,"Wilmslow, UK",May 2018,"Visited here April / May 18, and was pretty disappointed.  The sea is very rough and no good for swimming.  There was a lot of rubbish washed up on the beach. In our 10 day stay we only went to this beach once as the visit did not inspire us to come back for a 2nd visit. In fact struggled to find a beach in Bali that impressed us....can't beat the Caribbean for me!"
Kevin V,"Albany, Australia",Mar 2018,Nice beach to watch the sun go down. Can get a bit polluted throughout the year. Too many hawkers pushing their wares. Wouldn‚Äôt swim here...but that‚Äôs just me. 
ranjeetspecial,163 contributions,Apr 2018,Seminyak beach is ahead of Kuta and Legian beach and have some of the world's top hotels with private beaches. I stayed on Legian beach area and used to run every morning to Seminyak beach.
pvs867,"London, UK",Apr 2018,We stayed close to the beach at Petitenget and found it refreshingly uncrowned with huge stretches of lovely sand. My Partner lives to body board and the waves here were perfect for this
Barbara L,12 contributions,May 2018,"Great sand beach: take surflessons, buy fresh coconut drink, surfboards for rent.Relax ia only thing you have to do."
Andrea  P,San Diego,Apr 2018,"Maybe it is because I live close to the beach in Southern California that I was so disappointed, but without any emotions and just being realistic about what I saw - the beach is full of trash, rough sand and huge crowds. The beach side hotels are a turn-off, much better to stay away and close to Eat Street. I would not put a foot into that water."
Berenice N,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018,"With a couple of Bintang Beers and spicy burgers, we relaxed on comfortable cushions with other travellers, tourists and families and enjoyed the lively music provided by a variety of musicians. One of the pleasurable experiences, after eating and shopping, that is on offer in beautiful Seminyak, Bali."
buddyrogers32,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,A magnificent place to swim Mostly very clean ocean If torrential down pour then the sewerage can infiltrate the water - not good at allIt‚Äôs a tropical island though Very peaceful Waves perfect Well policed with surf life savers No sharks No jelly fish Have fun and enjoy the morning walks at 6 sunrise with all the tourists and locals and families 
MrsLudlow,Fort McMurray,Apr 2018,"Seminyak beach has the potential to be one of the best beaches in the world- but I was shocked at the amount of garbage and litter. It was truly heartbreaking to see- also almost all of the bars, restaurants and vendors on and near the beach use plastic straws, plastic bags and single use cups which is absolutely insane given the state of the beach. They should really put a ban on plastics in the area and put an effort in to clean the beach up. "
James S,"Sapcote, UK",Apr 2018,"Really liked this beach, was beautiful and peaceful.Not too busy or too many posers about.Some lovely vendors to, if you give them a chance and get talking to them.The sea was good fun, big waves but felt safe mucking about. üëçTasty snacks and cold beers available just over the bridge üëçThis was the section of beach by a temple and the mexicola bar "
madre&padre,Montenegro,Apr 2018,Good sandy beach with waves. Many restaurant and beach bar is on the beach. Beach is hughe and not crowded. You can hire or find for free sunbeds and umbrella (if you order drink from beach bar)
Cityboytraveller,"London, UK",Apr 2018,Good destination for a few days if passing through. Local government together with hotels needs to try to tackle the issue otherwise people will stop coming.
James K,9 contributions,Apr 2018,"The beach at Seminyak is much preferable than Kuta. Seminyak is a bit quieter and the people who are at Seminyak seem more international and discerning. The gentle rolling waves are ideal for beginner surfers and it is also good for swimming. Just a shame a bit the bits of plastic floating in the waters. Really sad to see. I picked up them myself and disposed of them in the rubbish bin and so did a few other tourists. If we all do that at the beaches in Bali, we can try to beat the plastic pollution problem.Oh, the sunsets at Seminyak are a sight to behold! Grab a bean bag and a drink and drink it all in."
jbmb1982,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,"Pleasant beach for a walk . Cleaner than we were expecting. Over-all  worth a visit but unless you like big crowds on bean bags and constant interruption by touts, you will probably only visit once.Cafes and bars dearer that in town and not as good. We went once for a daytime walk , and once for a sunset. After that , we had no reason to return.Its a personal choice."
Mishmashoflife,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2018,"This place has views that are priceless however the beach was dirty and rubbish blowing all around you, people constantly badgering you selling their items was a pain and not the best place we felt for safety. View yes beach no it was nasty ,who goes to a beach to pick a spot sitting there with rubbish at the side of them. We chose here for our wedding vow renewal and were very disappointed, don‚Äôt bank on this place for a wedding shot there is so much better places then here in the hills by the rice fields Bali struggles at best.We had to clear rubbish first as there was no gaps on the beach as there was already rubbish there and strangely enough a person came along to pick it up removed leaves from the trees that had fallen on the beach and left the rubbish go figure very odd. The view yes but just to get this shot alone yep we had to turn in to rubbish collectors before our wedding vow renewal not ideal but we had flown so far it was poor to say the least not a great start for a special day. "
K D,"London, UK",Apr 2018,Loved this beach. It has a nice vibe to it. It‚Äôs peaceful and the sunset is amazing. Colourful and unique. 
JR_Essex,"Chelmsford, UK",Apr 2018,"This is a great beach for walking however it is not without problems, mainly cleanliness. Most of this comes from offshore so is difficult to control and the hotels try and clean their part. The other issue is dogs messing on the beach. In Bali dogs are free to roam and you have to treed carefully. Sunsets are fantastic however."
Richard B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,"Seminyak Beach is particularly great in the afternoons as the day cools as it can be a bit of a hot place, don't get me wrong you can hire lounge chairs and umbrellas, cool drinks are never to far away. I particularly like the beach for it's beach break and good surf, I surfed Ku De Ta (in front of) and Seminyak beach in from of the temple, both spots are equally as good, most prefer to surf in front of Ku De Ta. Seminyak beach is extremely  popular at sunset as the view is breathtaking. At night time the restaurants and bars along the foreshore have bands and live music. There is always a buzz of life at Seminyak beach from the colourful people selling their wares, offering massages and all the beautiful life interactions. Definitely a place to visit and relax at.."
Clark Kenneth,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"i call this So-So Beach, because for me its already to crowded and it's make the sea water become dirty, but the view was Amazing when we chill and 'sunset-ing' "
Gastronoman61,"New York City, NY",Mar 2018,Dont understand what tourists see in this foul smelling and overcrowded beach. THis used to be a great spot 20 years ago but has deteriorated to such a point that I wouldn't even walk my dog there. One can see seweage water being pumped onto the beaches and frankly some of the worst eateries and bars in the area. Stay away if you're looking for a white sandy beach.
Taufik N,Indonesia,Apr 2018,"Seminyak Beach reckoned as best place to enjoy sunset. It is the same coast as Kuta Beach with wider sand bed line for evening walk. thin sea water over the sand create wide mirror effect. during visit it was bit cloudy, yet still able to got few minutes of sparkling golden sunset before covered by lower cloud."
ahmed a,50 contributions,Apr 2018,Amazing sunset view can be witnessed from there..Close to city centerAlwys busy placeMust go place
annabelle54321,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2018,"Good beach Good for boogie boarding but strong under current so swim near life guardsLots of places to hire beach beds, boogie boards and surfboards Bars all along which aren't as cheap as other places but the sunset view is worth the few extra dollars per beer"
Gladiator-Joe,"Kuta, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"Seminyak beach is a great place to swim, surf and most of all watch the sunset. There are a number of bars that have live music on the beach, recorded music and you can chill out sitting on a bean bag, drink Bintang (or any grog you like) and watch the sunset.Great for singles, couples and families. A must to visit when in Bali, in particular the most popular outdoor spot is La Plancha. Get the at least an hour before sunset. The only negative is the non-stop approaches by street vendors trying to sell you anything from paintings to hats. Just in gnome them and enjoy the location. They soon will leave you alone."
kurt J,New Zealand,Apr 2018,"Came here to watch the sunset. The beach is full of people, DJs, live music, merchant sellers, multiple beach venues with alot of hotels having little beach clubs. Find a spot and enjoy it on beanbags and table service.Time your moment and you can have that perfect beach sunset photo."
Steve,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2018,"My wife and I were at a wedding at a beach resort, beautiful sunset, but there are no golden sands, its nothing like our beaches in Australia!"
kashimastarlet,"Ubud, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"A nice black sand beach, beautifully maintained. I hung at the hotels pool and later ventured down to the beach to relax in the sand during sunset. This is not a beach for relaxing and swimming. It has a long shoreline and beautiful waves. The lifeguards are very active and the beach goes on for miles!"
Shaun T,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Apr 2018,We had a great stay at the White Colonial Villa in Seminyak. We were here last 10 years ago and wow has it developed but in a positive way. Definitely trying to keep class and an identity. Really enjoyed being in the hustle but being able to hide and chill out in the villa. 
Jagmeet S,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2018,a short walk from Seminiyak main street off KU DE TA .Disappointing as rather smelly and water is dirty.OK for a quick photo session but not earth shattering s it is hyped to be.
Germaine T,Malaysia,Apr 2018,"We came here two days in a row just for the sunset, best time to start at the beach is about 17.15pm local time where the sun is not too blinding to walk down the beach. And subset is about 19.00ish.. during the month we were here which was April, there wasn‚Äôt any large crowd at all so it was peaceful according to our driver the peak season is from May onwards. The beach was huge, lush sands but mirky water of course. Don‚Äôt expect blue or crystal clear waters.. lots of happy dogs running freely at the beach. Only thing that was a turn off was there was a dirty river of water flowing from one of the hotels in the middle of the beach straight down into the beach waters. It was so smelly and awful sight that the hotel‚Äôs dirty water was flowing towards the beach waters. You wouldn‚Äôt miss walking through it as it is a huge opening of water flowing down through the beach. But just don‚Äôt think of it and it will be fine!"
gavinpinion,"Warrington, UK",Apr 2018,"The sunsets on Seminyak beach are amazing! The sea is calm with an occasional wave the surfers try to catch. The off-putting smell of the surface water running from the village is a little off-putting at times if you are walking the length of the beach. There are some fantastic restaurants and bars along the edge of the shore. If you are getting around by taxi be careful - please ensure you use a ‚Äòblue bird taxi‚Äô and ask for the meter to be put on. The taxi fare from one end of the town to the other is approximately ¬£1 - ¬£2. Other cabs try to copy the blue bird company by calling themselves ‚Äòblue biro‚Äô, of ‚Äòblue taxi‚Äô but they are very very expensive."
Yagneshster,"Ahmedabad, India",Apr 2018,I visited this beach yesterday and im happy to write that you must visit this beach. Beach is clean and has a splendid sunset view in the evening
travelbug733,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,"As always here the water is polluted with rubbish, feacies, the beach is polluted with rubbish. It‚Äôs packed with drunk tourists who piss in the sand. There are several homeless wild uncared for starving dogs roaming the beach it‚Äôs very upsetting. If you are on the beach or at a beach bar you will be constantly harassed by hawkers trying to sell you things so it‚Äôs definitely not peaceful or relaxing. They sell lasers to anyone so there are tourists shining lasers up at planes flying in and into other peoples eyes and also poor dogs eyes. I stop a few kids from doing that and told them off their parents were blind drunk and careless.surfs okay you can catch great waves early morning and view some nice sun sets in the arvo. See for you self."
bibiranum,"Garut, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"4.30pm just perfect, u have 1.5 hours to swim, playing with the sands and waves a little bit and watch sunset with ur fam. "
Tech B,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2017,"This is a nice beach to relax and rest and enjoy the beauty of the sunset. The beach was very clean and nice , kids enjoyed lot."
Paul v,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Apr 2018,"All people are relaxing at the beach club, but if you just put down your towel it is perfect.Clean, nice water and yes a lot of hawkers but hee sometimes you need to eat and drink :-)"
The Walking Critic,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"I go to Bali a lot and yes, you can get rubbish washed up all the beaches but not this time. Spotlessly clean, quiet and a great place to hang out and suck up the Bali vibe. There is ample to do from lazing around to surfing. "
karan,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2018,A very quiet scenic and clean beach. Sea beds etc are available on rent for those who wish to use and enjoy it.  
UpInTheAir23,San Francisco,Apr 2018,I went to this beach the first week of April and it was nice! no plastics or trash on the beach as others wrote. I was on the part of the beach right in front of the Potato Head Beach Club. I would definitely go back and the sunsets are amazing.
Islam M,10 contributions,Apr 2018,It is one of beautiful and quite places to watch both sunrise and sunset. Good place for beginners to learn surfing.Nice and cheap food and drinks provide by the small restaurants on the beach side . 
natasha r,"Emersons Green, UK",May 2017,This beach was lovely that had a turtle sanctuary on the beach which was fantastic...there are little ice cooler box bars which are very welcoming one in particular was one called jimmys bar which has free WiFi which is always a bonus...all in all great experience. 
cirque,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"Not as crowded as Doublesix but Seminyak beach is the place to go for quiet time enjoying yourself basking under the sun, you can also view some surfing activities too. "
Kat S,"Bairnsdale, Australia",Apr 2018,"We ventured to Seminyak beach like all tourists to see the Sunset. The Sunset was stunning, so worth it. The beach itself is dirty... rubbish from people everywhere - did not swim at this beach. Brown dirt sand with rubbish sitting on the shoreline. Same at Legian and Kuta all the way along that coastline. Such a shame this place is marred by rubbish from human use."
Pricie1,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2018,Do yourself a favour and call Made when you holidaying in Bali. Best driver we have ever had and we have been a few times now. Made speaks great English and knows the areas and customs / history very well. Made has many contacts in Bali so is a wealth of knowledge. Easy to contact through messenger so organising all our transport requirements was a breeze. Thanks Made! I have taken a photo of Made‚Äôs business card for your reference. 
venonsim,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018,Nice Beach with stunning view! Definitely a must visit for anyone of any purpose. Sunrise or sunset is a must to see. 
Na Tone,42 contributions,Apr 2018,I‚Äôll give it 3 stars because it‚Äôs nice to hang out but there are better beaches to go. With clear water and white sand for example. 
andyst81,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2018,"This beach at sunset is a real highlight of Seminyak. There are a lot of people, but the vibe is super chilled and there are some really nice places to sit, eat and drink.A must do at least once for everyone in the area."
donnat_11,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2018,A little disappointed with Seminyak Beach after Kuta.  No chairs on beach or options to have a cool drink while you watch the sun set.  Every man and his dog there.  Nothing spectacular about the sand or the water.  Creek running into the beach made for a not-very-pleasant ambiance.
burygirlkeeper,"Bury, UK",Apr 2018,"Lovely warm clean water, opportunity to hire sun loungers and surf boards. Lots of bars and good music, cheap and expensive food options."
tonysprings,hartlepool,Apr 2018,Lovely beach to walk along and lay on but always barter for a sunbed. Very clean and good for swimming or surfing....well worth a visit...
Kaehto,Singapore,Mar 2018,"While I agree that this could be a beautiful beach to watch sunsets - this is the definition of dirty... Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. All you ever dreamt of in terms of plastic waste is available, yoghurt cups, plastic bags, syringes. And of course many other things like bottles etc. More than high time that local authoritiues (""guided"" by the Tourism stakeholders) take decisive action."
vazr2016,"Lisbon, Portugal",Apr 2018,"Specially between October and March this beach is very dirty, full of locals selling things and eating. It‚Äôs not a good beach to catch sun "
Tania P,18 contributions,Apr 2018,Beautiful sunset at Seminyak beach. Plenty of restaurants and bars along the beach. You can grab a drink at la plancha and watch the sunset.
Maya Renoir,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018,"There is so many little bar around this beach it is amazing. It s cheap and you can find live music as well. Less busy than Kuta which is good. Perfect place to relax and have a bintang, "
craigeyles62,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,Without doubt the best food I have eaten anywhere in the world and what about that sunset over the Indian Ocean
chattam2013,"Canberra, Australia",Apr 2018,Beautiful walk along the beach in the mid morning whilst the tide was out.  Lots of bars and cafes on the beach with plenty of seating and umbrellas.  
Will H,27 contributions,Apr 2018,"If you like beaches and have the slightest bit of humanity DO NOT GO HERE!!The beaches are disgusting you can not see the sand through the garbage! Like i said in previous posts i travel world wide with work and see much poorer places then Indonesia but I have never seen so much plastic on a beach in my life, it was heart breaking to see!If you like hippy/back packing vibes them come here, otherwise stay clear it‚Äôs disgusting, no culture no nothing as offensive as this is to say, tourists (mainly Australians) have done what the British have done to parts of Spain, ruined it!If you like culture and history move around Bali, yes it fine to be based here but you need to travel around"
Jon S,16 contributions,Apr 2018,Awesome place to go for a run while in Bali! At times it can be hard to find a place to run in Bali by this beach is perfect ! 
Patricia S,158 contributions,Mar 2018,"We stayed in Seminyak, I love the hotel where we stayed, loved that the beach is a great place to watch the sunset but....the water is sooooo dirty. I didn‚Äôt even want to get my feet wet. I love the beach, but the water was so dirty I just swam in the hotel‚Äôs pool which I normally won‚Äôt do because I prefer saltwater."
dfect24,"London, UK",Apr 2018,"Firstly I‚Äôd like to say the surrounding bars and rental places are all really nice, friendly and very affordable. It‚Äôs just a huge shame that the swell of the sea seems to accumulate so much rubbish onto the beach. Surfing wise it‚Äôs great for beginners, lots of long white water waves to practise on and get your rhythm. It‚Äôs nice, but there‚Äôs far nicer beaches around Bali."
Jacquie B,"Neutral Bay, Australia",Apr 2018,Although the locals rake up the mess everyday the beach is dirty. I would not take my grandchild in the water there. The sunsets are fabulous but the sand is black. 
Peter T,35 contributions,Apr 2018,A nice beach with a lot of bean-bag bars. We went here one night to see the sunset. Truly amazing. A must-do when in Semniak. Not sure how the beach is during daytime. Not the cleanest beach in Bali. 
LauraDragon,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,"The beach has potential but the garbage it is a turn off. The water is blue, the weather incredible, the sand good and then you see the waist and you want to run away! "
Annaexe,"Manchester, UK",Apr 2018,"Not a kind of beach you‚Äôd go to enjoy during the day neither for tanning nor for walking, but it was nice to watch sunset from the bars nearby "
hopefulalice,"Hope, Canada",Mar 2018,"I was super excited to spend a week in Seminyak - until I hit the beach. Disappointing! Garbage is everywhere (if ANY country wants to know we need to ban plastic bottles, go to this beach!) - dogs run the beach (and with dogs comes excrement) - and it was very crowded. I did not enjoy swimming in garbage nor could I stomach walking around so much waste. It is so sad. Such beauty being destroyed by so much trash. If you are a beach person, or just enjoy a clean area, AVOID THIS BEACH!"
Judyannechan,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"The sand is darkish, very fine & it sticks to you. Our hotel had a water tap to rinse your feet off before walking further.  In front of our hotel, the Alila, the beach was clean & you did not get pestered to buy things.  The waves were quite high when we were there, the red flags were up.  Yes, there are noisey Clubs which can disturb the peace of the beach.  I guess it depends on where you are on the beach.  The sunsets are indeed beautiful.  I found that early mornings on the beach were nice."
syams_arief,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"SEMINYAK BEACH not really into my fav beach in bali. Nowdays this beach too dirty to swim, sometime you will find the trash from visitor who visited there. "
Maharsh S,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2018,"Okay to maybe spend an hour or so sipping a beer at this beach. It is not very clean and very crowded generally. It is a regular beach with no real beauty as such to enjoy. When it comes to Bali, there are far many, many more beaches that are much better."
Michael A,"Istanbul, Turkey",Apr 2018,Plastic everywhere. In the evening singers on the various bars bellow to out be heard adding to the chaos. 
Rohit S,2 contributions,Feb 2018,"This is one of the clean beaches in Bali . There are various cafes and restaurants in the vicinity and on the beach. Many hotels and small shops also adjoin the area . One will find peace , luxury and privacy at the same time here. "
slippery35,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"There is nothing better  than kicking back on a beanbag, sipping a cocktail and watching the sun go down."
Natalie C,"London, UK",Mar 2018,Lovely beach to walk down. Good views of the sunset but a shame about all the rubbish that was strewn about. 
Kurt K,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2018,I had very minimal expectations when I arrived in Bali. The condition of the beaches are disgusting to say the least. Don't expect a lovely holiday sun baking on the sand! 
Jane-Louise B,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2018,This beach has to have the best sunsets anywhere.  Each night there were different colours and its great to watch from the beachside cafes with a drink in your hand.  Take  heaps of photos as the colours are amazing
Julie L,27 contributions,Apr 2018,"I love that place sinces years, that‚Äôs why I would like to highlight the fact that Moreno and more plastic is found on the beach... not a big news but I hope things will change for the best. First time I was going with a kid and to be honest it s not the best side of the island to go if you w not to go on the beach, the waves are too strong."
TimandVal,"Berwick, Australia",Oct 2017,"Seminyak beach.It's a beach.It's darker sand due to volcanic activity It sticks to youThere are facilities at various points but not well managed.The food is ok at various points if you like pizza.At night there are bands playing and comfy places to sit which is the highlight.You can sit on it, it's a beach.For once I preferred the pool which I don't very often do.  Can't put my finger on why, perhaps it was a little too grungy, and I like grungy.Better beaches;CreteCorfuFrankstonWhitsundayHamilton islandLake PattersonBondiCarrum Kos- kardamena Zante.The list goes on.....  it was a pretty average beach I feel."
Kinnjall,6 contributions,Mar 2018,Must visit once during your stay in seminyak or Kuta. Nice place to spend your evening. Should reach there by 5.30 to enjoy sunset. Have a couple if drinks there by beach. I love it. 
Phil1999,U.K.,Apr 2018,Don't bother filthy dirty piles of rubbish stinking stream only seen one please worse that was India what a shame went to bech club instead.
Huntley U,59 contributions,Mar 2018,"We had some drinks in La Plancha while watching the sunset and i also did my early morning walk in double six beach. I walked for 45 mins and i saw garbage ( plastic cups, straws, cans, toothpaste case, toothbrush, pet bottles and cover, rubber sandals ...) all over the beach. "
Holly,"Vancouver, Canada",Mar 2018,"I wanted to love this beach, I almost always choose the ocean over a swimming pool. Our hotel was directly in front of it, but I opted for the hotel pool 100% of the time for swimming & relaxing. I loved watching the surfing and everyone enjoying the water, but there was so much plastic and garbage on the beach it was unfortunate and made me not want to spend much timethere. It was certainly pretty from afar & very popular with locals and tourists alike. "
SJKcat,"London, UK",Mar 2018,"We have visited Seminyak beach and were really horrified by how dirty it is and the amount of plastic all over the beach. It‚Äôs so upsetting to see piles of plastic all over the shore. I just wanted to pick it all up, but there is so much everywhere  it would not have made a difference. There are some lovely bars to watch the sunset from, however the view is ruined by the amount of plastic everywhere all around you.We didn‚Äôt ever see anyone cleaning up the plastic at any point. We have seen many beautiful clean beaches in other parts of the world so this was a real shock. I would not visit this beach whilst it is in this mess.Something seriously needs to be done about this situation and the poor environment :("
Belle C,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Mar 2018,The beach has black sand and has quite a lot of rubbish on it. There is also rubbish I. The sea and it is very choppy so not good for swimming but good for surfing 
Danny C,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Mar 2018,"Sadly the beach has been used and not maintained, the rubbish is piled at the back of the beach and the sea is full of old plastic bags etc and who knows what else. The sufers seem to like it due to the high waves but for general swiming and bathing i would advise to choose another location. I also think the locals and goverment could do more to help clean up the beach and surrounding areas. We moved on after a short stay and will not be returning."
vanness77,37 contributions,Mar 2018,I usually go to the beach club but walking along the Seminyak beach is a great experience for me. Better come in July-August though. 
Kellie G,"Hobart, Australia",Mar 2018,"I've been here a few times, and while I love the little beach cafes and seeing lots of people walking and the locals, it's not a beach I would swim in. There's a lot of rubbish along the waterline. Dogs doing their business in the water... Pretty at night with the cafes and beach seating, well worth the look. Great for long beach walks. Lots of swim schools, but again, I wouldn't swim in the water. "
sashasen,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2018,I used to visit the Seminyak beach especially the private beach of Marriott ... the beach is clean and so is the water ... something that cannot be said about its counterparts in Kuta ... it is not tio crowded unlike Kuta and Legian and has a classy feel to it ... Overall a nice experience !
Man571,"Hyderabad, India",Mar 2018,"We spent about 4 hours during sunset at Double dix beach . Beach is great with medium waves for kids .   Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach , they offer bean bags to relax  while eating with live music and flood lighting right until midnight . "
travelerFlorida_USA,"Pompano Beach, FL",Mar 2018,"The beach in Seminyak was a bit disappointed as although sandy the water was not very clear and the beach had a lot of debris around. We were told the beach is cleaned every morning and the plastic bottles, wrappers and other debris is brought in by the current. Every afternoon, people gather at the beach to watch the sunset. There are many bars and music. The big is quite long. "
MihiAHerbert,"Gosford, Australia",Mar 2018,Our experience at Seminyak beach was good. Friendly people offering you a Bintang and surfing lessons.
Freddy S,"Terrigal, Australia",Mar 2018,Great spot to sit in bean bagd and watch sunset whilst drinking Bintangs.Only down side is rubbish left on beach
Dagalong,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,The night life on the beach is amazing.  The food was great and the atmosphere impossible to fault with all that goes on.
Kaztravels74,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2018,"Walked from very clean Double 6 to main Seminyak and it was filthy, covered in rubbish and barely anyone on the beach. We couldn‚Äôt get off quick enough and the taps we found next to the beach weren‚Äôt working (to wash our feet). Yuck. No vendors selling their wares on the beach either, that says something."
Laura L,20 contributions,Mar 2018,"You just can‚Äôt keep up with the Indian Ocean trash, but they give an average effort. Lots of nightlife and live music. Many offerings for dinning and spas. Average shopping. "
saifudin122,2 contributions,Mar 2018,Having good times. Sunset very good spot. Many cafe and good restaurant surround. Facility was quite good especially if you are in anantara hotel or alila hotel. 
Theodor111,"Zurich, Switzerland",Mar 2018,sunset is great very dirty beach. lot of plastics and other garbage. water not clean as well.panorama is nice
JonNewport,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,We walk along this beach most mornings and enjoy the surf and fresh air. Fir the most part the beach is clean but after a high tide it may get a bit messy. There are a lot of spots these days where Balinese are keeping it clean and it is certainly better than it used to be.
Stu B,328 contributions,Mar 2018,"We visited for the sunset for a few times whilst in Seminyak: the colour of the sky is beautiful! Not a great beach for sunbathing during the day as the sand is incredibly hot and the beach is covered in litter. Indonesia really does have a plastic pollution problem which ruins the feel of the beach. I've yet to find a good beach in Bali which is a shame. That aside, check out the sunshine. Plenty of bars to sit in or bean bags to sit on and enjoy the view "
Sushobhan M,36 contributions,Mar 2018,"We went there last week as soon as we landed in Bali.The beach is really relaxing and clean, perfect for a beach run or beach walk. Drink prices around the beach are quite reasonable with beer costing around 25000rp which is around 2 dollars. If you are a keen surfer, they also offer surf lessons and beach looks perfect for surfing. "
StevieB10,"Macclesfield, UK",Mar 2018,"Miles of sandy beach, waves big enough to surf, just idyllic üèÑüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèäüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è absolutely deserted last Saturday on Bali's Day of Silence and Hindu New Year in Indonesia. Happy New Year!  "
Elaine,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Finding a place to dine by the beach with some acoustic live music? Then you will love Seminyak like we do. My BF and I visited the beach for 4 consecutive nights at the same beach side stall for their amazing view, and live music. Stalls were set up on the beach itself , facing the sea and bean bag chairs were lay out with a table for dinning makes it even more relaxing. The staff were really friendly too."
224elmarp,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"While the kids really enjoy the stroll at the beach, collecting seashells and catching small crab, I cant help to notice the abundance of plastic rubbish on the beach. What a pity, hopefully the plastic usage can be reduced throughout the world and Bali specifically to avoid further damage to the environment. "
anubhavwashere,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2018,Perfect for walks and relaxing. Just few steps from Courtyard Marriott hotel. Very happening place compare to other beaches in Bali.
Quirky L,4 contributions,Mar 2018,The beach was nice not to crowded not to noisy but there was a lot of garbage on the beach. It ruined the experience for us.
Rob A,"South Yorkshire, UK",Mar 2018,"Looks great from afar. Once there you'll see wandering dogs taking a dump in the sea, litter and trash washed onto the sand from sea. Hassle galore from garbage sellers on the sand. Pretty much sums it up. Oh the water is lovely and warm. Just has dog dump in it among other things. "
Lord P,2 contributions,Mar 2018,Very worth while to visit lively beach great for surfing people friendly and relaxed. Super sun sets 
Danielle S,8 contributions,Mar 2018,Seminyak Beach was probably beautiful once.  But not anymore.  An early morning walk will reveal the beach and waters edge completely...yes completely...covered in plastic trash debris.  The poor labourers from beachfront posh hotels and the odd restaurant try valiantly to rake up this rubbish before the punters arrive expecting clean sand.  It is thoroughly depressing. An environmental catastrophy.  The walk behind the beachside cafes stinks and is full of litter.  As always the Balinese people are friendly and upbeat but how long can we all go on pretending this place is anything other than a polluted and ruined once-was-paradise.
mdilk,"Wakefield, UK",Mar 2018,Found a nice place to sit and watch the sunset sat on beanbags watching the sun go down a great experience 
Pernille Spang R,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Mar 2018,"Lots of people and sooooo many sales people wanting to sell you bracelets, massage, etc. The beach chairs are pretty expensive compared to other beaches on the island. "
Kadek A,7 contributions,Mar 2018,"Nice beach with white sands but still need improvement to do with their facilities.  Surrounding by world famous hotel,  great villas and some amazing beach clubs in the world,  seminyak beach has popular tourist destination. The sunset also spectacular from here. Try hang out from one of the beach clubs around here and you will amaze with amazing vibes. "
Mark D,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2018,Seminyak Beach is a lot quieter than Kuta or even Legian..... beautiful place for a stroll first thing in the morning or late of an afternoon to watch the sunset.
Thomas,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2018,This is a nice part of the beaches here. There's always plenty surfers to watch when you're relaxing in one of the relaxed beachfront restaurants here. A good spot to spend a nice lazy day but also a spot where you can get all the exercise you can handle. Sometimes it can get a little busy but most of the time it's just outside of the main crowd to offer a relaxed spot.
jaceka49,"Jacksonville, FL",Feb 2018,The beach itself is very nice and there are a lot of restaurant and resorts on the beach. I often go to beach to enjoy the sunset.
anton10186,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"The sun set is owesome.  The beach is near many hotel ,.  I was not able to enjoy since the beach is dirty.  Many garbage from the visitor.   As visitor . We must come and go without leave something in the beach.  "
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"Seminyak beach is black sand beach and the sea is generally clean to swim in.  The best part of the beach is the sunset. As seminyak is on the west part of Bali, you will get spectacular sunsets each day.  There are some restaurants with lots of chairs and lounge for guests to have drinks and watch the sunset. "
Pierre/Mary W,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018,We had the chance to visit the beach at Seminyak. Our biggest surprise was to find the beach covered with rubbish. Plastic everywhere and no one seems to care. I spent one month in 1982 and we called Bali a small paradise. To return there was very disappointing and if nobody care about pollution let‚Äôs continue this way and have a great holiday on the communal tip.
Huxter09,"Numurkah, Australia",Mar 2018,"Seminyak beach , a long greyish sand beach with endless swell atm. Not a lot of crowd and like everyone else, we're wondering where all the tourists are . Is Mt Agung and it's low rumbles keeping tourists away ? Suits us as we can have our pick of beach lounges , cold drinks at hand and out three year old grandson to entertain us while his Daddy surfs.Bosrd hire seems cheap but our boy has his one of his own , designed for North Narrabeen but handling Bali's surf beautifully .Horse riding along the beach too and not much sign of the litter problem we'd be warned about . Hazy day but just beautiful and a bit of breeze to cool us down . Perfect "
Jennifer L,1 contribution,Jan 2018,"Clean, good for enjoying your sunday after stress working. I like to come here a lot. never bored seeing the ocean"
TonyCondon,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018,"A good place to unwind and catch the rays. Beach has vast array of hotels bars and restaurants, covering the whole cost spectrum. From a photograph or seaside pool, is fits the postcard image. The negative is unfortunately the swim in the ocean or walk on the sand where all forms of modern day waste ruin the experience."
Tazim Z,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Feb 2018,"Nothing like laying on a bean bag under a colorful Arabian style umbrella, smoking shisha with catchy loud music in the background and relaxedly enjoying the pre-evening beach breeze and sunset @ Seminyak Beach.Simply awesome!!! üèñüåÑüèäüèªüèÇüéº"
Heidi G,"Tromso, Norway",Mar 2018,What a beautiful bechwalk. But no swim - unless you like swimming with plastic litter. But all the beanbag cafees are  soo nice ‚ô°
Priyansh M,"Ahmedabad, India",Feb 2018,"May be it's us, but after visiting beaches at Kuta and Nusa dua, somehow Seminyak was a let down. It's not bad. It's decent infact. But it neither has hustle of Kuta nor the serenity of Nusa dua.. "
gensivalingam,"George Town, Malaysia",Feb 2018,Can be improved more especially cleanliness. safely also can be concern here as very large number of tourist in this place
Vtan888,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2018,Most hotels around seminyak have private beaches. Tend to have strong waves so might not be ideal for swims. Along the seminyak main road there are many restaurant and pubs. Hip and busy so great for a night out.. 
Janice,"Cape Town, South Africa",Feb 2018,"As far as beaches go, this has got to be the worst beach l have ever seen. I was her a year previous and returned to see if it had been cleaned since, it had not.It had raw sewage coming down a river which continues to flow down the river a year later. There were no white horses in the sea but brown horses of sewage. Coming to Bali for this beach would be a big mistake."
Marijka T,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018,I can‚Äôt say I have ever seen that much domestic waste being washed up on the beach. It is being cleaned many times during the day but not great to go in the sea. 
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,Once beautiful Bali is now the most polluted island in the world with its water literally thick with rubbish of all types. Nappies and bags and all sorts of disgusting items wrap around your face if your foolish enough to swim in it.  This beach and its waters are literally toxic and J advise you not to swim at the beach. It smells and the rubbish piles high on the sand.
tarmigan50,"Norwich, UK",Feb 2018,If you want a beach holiday dont go here the beaches are disgusting litter everywhere. People say they try to clear it up but im sorry if you want tourists to come here you need to try harder. It is not good for an island the rely on tourism. Please tell me why i would want to pay to sit on your sunbeds surrounded by rubbish get a rake and a bin bag and clear it up PLEASE. Its such a shame as the rest of the island is beautiful. Go to Sanur sunbeds half the price and no rubbish.
Sam B,"London, UK",Feb 2018,"The place is so dirty I don't know how anyone can want to come here! We stayed in Seminyak for 4 nights thinking it would be a beach holiday but we took one look at the beach and we couldn't understand how this place is advertised as a beach destination.The waves are so high and rough you cannot swim in the sea, and the sand has so much rubbish it's disgusting. Poor wildlife! Such a shame. Even large 5 star resort hotels didn't seem to care to clean up the patch of sand that their hotels overlook.We ended up sending the 4 nights in Seminyak around a pool. Will not be returning."
team l,2 contributions,Feb 2018,"Plastic Rubbish can be seen EVERYWHERE. Worst part is, smelly water from sewage directly goes to the ocean water; no pipe is used, water flows to the sand and then to the ocean. So disgusting. Very disappointing."
jotage2017,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,Beautiful shore line and sandy beach but extremely dirty please wear shoes as their is broken glass and rubbish everywhere 
Kylie S,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018,"You will find the beach has black sand and accommodates many bars & restaurants There is no escaping beach sellers, with sarongs, paintings and other trinkets with thier well rehearsed ""I give you good deal"" The beach is littered with rubbish, broken glass and other not so friendly beach items.During the day its hot, with some what rough conditions.The beach offers direct walking access to Kuta in the south, or Potato Head in the north.At night the beach comes alive with bean bags, colourful umbrellas and beach dining.Definitely go explore and make your own decision. For me, its not a swimming beach."
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,We have been a regular visiter to the beach over many years and little has changed. Hawkers in plenty but once you no how to handle them they add to the scene. BINTANG is cold and offered at a cheap price so grab a beer relax and enjoy the sunset.
sydneyloner,sydney,Feb 2018,"I've been to this part of Bali for 5/6 times over the years but I was horrified to see how polluted this beach has become this time. It really has no reason to visit anymore unless the local government acts immediately and strenuously to curb use of plastic packaging on the island. I also found injection needle on the beach but when I handed it to a guy who was cleaning he didn't seem to be too care about what I found, which might reflect such found was nothing unusual. I'll go elsewhere instead of Bali or at least this part of Bali anyway."
Ontheroadagain4648,"Sussex Inlet, Australia",Feb 2018,"I know its popular and well known, but as far as beaches are concerned it is just a beach. There are so many nicer, cleaner and more picturesque beaches in the world...must admit on a nice evening sunset it does look romantic."
ebatancs,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,"Trash everywhere on the beach. Cleaned regularly, but it is just piled up at the back of the beach. Not too bothered by traders hassling. If you don't engage in conversation, they leave you alone."
Adam H,"Redbank Plains, Australia",Feb 2018,An amazing sunset there was not to many persons there on the night we went there i would say a must stop for any person havi g a holiday in bali. Amazing photo opportunities 
Deeyaneeh C,31 contributions,Feb 2018,"Quite disappointed with the beach. It was dirty and trash is on the shore. I didn‚Äôt swim and I dare not to swim. Maybe it was because of the weather since it‚Äôs wet season but still, they could have done better! "
Jenny,"Rasnov, Romania",Feb 2018,"This is the dirtiest beach I‚Äôve seen in Bali so far. They clean it regularly but still there is a lot of garbage. Good for surfers-beginners. Sand and small waves (white water). No good schools nearby though (at least I haven‚Äôt come across). There is a lot of bars on this beach. The ones that are close to the entrance are very expensive, the further the cheaper. There are people trying selling you goods but not a lot of them and they pass if you ignore them. "
julia_le84,"Richland, WA",Feb 2018,"We came in February and it was dirty with trash.  From what we heard, the storm pushed all trash from other islands to the beaches.  So hopefully it will be nicer when you go."
MichelleR1965,"Camberley, UK",Feb 2018,The guys looking after the beds do a great job of clearing what is the dirtiest beach we've been too. So much rubbish coming ashore. I certainly would not swim in the sea. Such a shame as it's such a nice sandy beach
Nyu24,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"Perfect sunset, nice beer and lite bites; the  unbeatable combination. We loved to spend time here until the sun was down. "
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,This is not what you see on the tourism photos. Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. It spoils the beach but it also spoils the harmony. Bali is not a beach paradise with this spoiling it that is for sure.2203
Kevin T,"Hoi An, Vietnam",Feb 2018,"Though it was raining hard this morning, it was a nice walk! There were a bit of rubbish on the beach at some places but it was raining , so guessing all the rubbish are being washed out onto the beach but like I've said it was a very nice walk by the sea üôÇ. "
Paul R,United Kingdom,Feb 2018,"First time we went down to the beach, there was a lot of trash on the beach.  Maybe thrown up by some rough seas, but it was a little disconcerting to have to step over it.  Now it appears there has been some effort to clear it up, but some still remains.It didn't impact our stay at all, but worth noting.  Look past that, and it's still beautiful. "
Christian S,"Beijing, China",Feb 2018,Overall Bali is quite dirty. Trash everywhere. The Seminyak and Kuta beach strip is probably the dirtiest beach I‚Äôve ever experienced. There‚Äôs much better and cleaner beaches on Bali such as geger beach in Nusa dua or belinga beach.
Blazing P,23 contributions,Feb 2018,I found Seminyak beach a little off putting with so much rubbish washed up along the sand. üò£ Not sure why so many people travel to Bali for the beach life when the jungle is so much more beautiful üçÉ
Marian P,4 contributions,Feb 2018,Great beach but at this time was pretty dirty with washed up rubbish - mainly plastic . Have to say the locals were out early morning to clear each day . 
Andy P,50 contributions,Feb 2018,Really disappointed with the cleanliness of the beach.It‚Äôs pretty much a rubbish dump for plastic.  It seems to be a bit of an environmental disaster that no one is willing to address.It‚Äôs a very depressing beach and not somewhere that is enjoyable to spend time.Bali you need to clean up the environment! 
rinna62,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,Walked along the beach and was so dirtyNot sure if I could ever swim thereThe council needs to do something to improve
roberto,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,compared to kuta beach this is heaven. It is clean and it is cleaned every morning there are heaps of places offering umbrellas and Lounge deck chairs and the umbrellas there are cheap motorbikes and taxis to take you anywhere there are cold drinks and toilets available
tinablueeyes87,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,We went for a walk on  Seminyak beach 2 days ago and were horrified to find how filthy and littered with rubbish it was. There is no beauty to this beach and even upon finding Ku De Ta (by mistake) we wouldnt have known it was there as the beach there was still filthy. There was rubbish in piles and mounds everywhere. Will not be back to Scuminyak beach nor will we suggest it to anyone :-(
Takako R,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"We went for a walk along Seminyak beach, and we were not impressed.Rubbish, plastic, bottles everywhere!People were sitting down on the beach and having drinks and dinner right in front of rubbish...Inside of hotels and villas are always kept clean but why don‚Äôt they look after their island??  Have seen local people eating food and throwing rubbish after they finish on the street and beaches...Keep your island CLEAN !!"
fmrosealex,"Dublin, Ireland",Feb 2018,"Went here in February and left immediately, but not before paying the extortionate price of 100k for a sun lounger and being harassed by multiple women selling sarongs etc. The beach was filthy, littered in plastic and the sea was full of plastic too - my boyfriend literally came out with food wrappers stuck to his body. The waves were huge but not good for surfing and people were being taken out by the waves even in shallow watwr. The water is warm but it‚Äôs warm everywhere else in Bali too so go somewhere else "
JessJake1923,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,Went to Seminyak to check out the beach and got a huge shock the beach was disgusting rubbish piled up all over it We were told it was the weather that caused the rubbish So many plastic bags all washed up we were shocked to see the beach looking like a huge rubbish tip 
carryonabroad,Melb,Jan 2018,"What a tip during this time of year, could not believe our eyes first morning we ventured down to walk the beach rubbish strewn as far as you could see just as many other travellers pics have shown  , INDONESIA get your act together this is disgraceful , we are told  'its all from Java "" due to the stormy weather around this time of year REALLY? . Would not go anywhere near swimming in the ocean on this coast of Bali if you want a cleaner beach try Sanur as this Problem runs from Jimbaran to Seminyak"
Michael P,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",Jan 2018,"Went for a day during low season (January), when it's said that trade winds wash a fair amount of pollution into the area. The beach itself was filthy - could have used a good cleaning. Did not go into the water. Hawkers everywhere. Just dirty, dirty, dirty - couldn't wait to shower after leaving the place."
Steve G,"Forresters Beach, Australia",Jan 2018,Not the cleanest beach we have seen and be careful not to be run over by the learn to surf groups. Nevertheless the water is cooler than the outside temp and the sunbeds for hire are very comfortable but we did swim one at a time in the surf for fear of losing gear..
ShaunSAFA,"Karratha, Australia",Feb 2018,"We were looking forward to some beach time in the sun. Unfortunately Seminyak beach was covered in trash very very dirty, not impressed."
Russell D,"Hampton, Australia",Feb 2018,The beach looks quite dirty with rubbish collected in piles most mornings.The sand is dark and grainy.We didn't swim as it didn't look clean.Mainly busy on a Sunday as the locals have family gatherings.
kathryn soo,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"This area of beach is better than double six beach. Much cleaner and less rubbish. Also, you can hop into bars for a drink or just for sunset view at any bars around. Come here for chilling by the beach instead of double six beach"
SiddiM,86 contributions,Feb 2018,"This beach has a scenic view , surrounded my multiple shacks but unfortunately not maintained.You see garbage lying all around, shacks aren't clean and hygienic , there were no sea guards.... There were no swings- which is like the usp of Bali ! Overall I suggest can be avoided ! "
Paddy_Snaps,402 contributions,Aug 2017,"Semknyak beach was nice place to go surfing, enjoy sunset or listen to live music in one of the shacks.Good for an early morning jog also - but be careful of the open gutters on the beach. "
den5lb,"Leeds, UK",Feb 2018,"As beaches go the walk from Semiyak, past Legian to Kuta isn‚Äôt the most pleasant. The positive: Beach bars galore semiyak end with cheap beer and entertainment at sunset! However if you are specifically describing the beach huge amounts of rubbish wash up, I‚Äôve read on travel blogs this is a problem this time of year but I was surprised at the sheer amount. Every man and his dog wants to teach you to surf however I can imagine there are nicer places to do this. I for one look forward to travelling to more remote locations in search of the white sandy beautiful beaches I without hesitation know exist on this beautiful island. "
ChristineHK,"Sande Municipality, Norway",Jan 2018,Nice beach for surfers or for a walk. High waves and very windy when we were there. Nice sunset spot. A little messy since it‚Äôs rainy season. 
elizabeth m,"Liverpool, UK",Jan 2018,"We were not impressed at all with the beach in Seminyak. The locals told us it was because of the rain and storms which has washed all the rubbish ashore and deposited it in the beach, the place was so dirty and just disappointed."
Linda W,2 contributions,Dec 2017,"We arrived a week ago in nusa dua beach resort was bit priceyBut overall was beautiful now today we arrived in Seminyak at our villa for next 2weeks villa really nice ,made our way to beach Omg what disappointment beach full rubbish even the sea looks dirty no one has never commented on this ,will keep to posted xx"
Donna_Elle,"Manila, Philippines",Jan 2018,"Didn‚Äôt stay long as we visited in the late morning and it was hot, hot, hot! The beach was clean though."
LeaFry,"Toowoomba, Australia",Jan 2018,"Seminyak beach is a great place ti spend an evening with friends relaxing on a bean bag sipping drinks, having a nibble and chatting with friends. Great atmephere to just sit back and chill. Music can be loud. Pick your favourite bar and sit back. Enjoy a sunset if there's no cloud. We missed out. 2 weeks of cloud cover. Day time take a swim but expect debri on beach coming in with the tides. Water is warm. Dont expect white sandy beaches as it is dark grey volcanic sand. "
Pilar S,"Mexico City, Mexico",Jan 2018,When I came to Bali I thought I was going to see the most outstanding beachesSeminyak is a nice town the water is warm and people are very friendly
TheCamelot,"Quezon City, Philippines",Jan 2018,"We went here to have some beer at night time and chill. Although it was a windy day, they beach was fine but the water of the beach were too far from the shore, its nice to sit back and relax here while drinking, it wasnt  crowded at all and there were no vendors bugging me unlike in Kuta beach there are too many people forcing us to buy something! but it was a little dirty and its sand was dark grey, unlike in pandawa and padang padang beach which has white sand.. Overall, it was a good place to watch the sunset and relax after a day tour in Bali! üòäüëçüèª"
Lisa W,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2018,"Unfortunately, Seminyak beach is completely covered in litter. The water is quite wavy and nice to listen to but isn‚Äôt very blue at all either. Won‚Äôt be returning to Seminyak. "
happyblender,"Athens, Greece",Aug 2017,"Surfing and relaxing is the best  way of living in holidays.Bali is definitely that place.nice people, full of fruits everywhere.."
Fifi I,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"It was hot day when arriving this beach, the waves was very mesmerizing and its quiet too bcz of less people around. I love to be here, but too bad there were a lot trash like plastic etc between the waves. too bad bcz i was hard to find trash can around the beach. I hope the management of this beach could do something about this. Seriously the only thing tht disturbing on this beach was only trash. "
Cliverd,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,I thought the whole of the beach from Seminyak through to Kuta was very average and with a lot of rubbish washed up on the sand
Dive Master H,"Moorea, French Polynesia",Jan 2018,"I rate this the best beach in Bali for the sunset, and altho there is trash on the beach like every beach here in Bali, this one had the least.  I recommend the part around seminyak square, on up. Potato Head if an amazing place to catch the sunset, with great service. Pictures below are ones I took from Potato Head"
JCTravelLog2016,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"It's tough to write a review for an entire beach. Even tougher to write about a constantly changing thing... so let me paint broad strokes: Seminyak beach is brown-sugar sand that is best experienced May-Oct -- off-shore wind, dry season, sun, surf, hustle&bustle and of course: epic sunsets."
Gio A,"Milan, Italy",Jan 2018,"Useless to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôll be bothered by locals who try to sell you stuff‚Äù because that is written in every single review of Bali, get over it, that‚Äôs what they do to get money.The beach is BEAUTIFUL, and the best thing I can advice you to do is to go there to watch the sunset, as it really warms your heart."
Graham W,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",Jan 2018,What a mad place we spent new year 2018 here. Fireworks  galore. We loved it.Fireworks for hours we had a ball letting them off
Cynthia,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,1st visit to Bali. Disappointed by the dirty state of the beach. Maybe the heavy rains washed up a lot of rubbish but we didn't swim there at all.
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Jan 2018,Nice wide and sandy beach with magnificent views and tons of rubbish plus some stray dogs roaming around. Lack of basic services like chairs and umbrellas for rent or food stalls. It‚Äôs a shame since this place has a lot of potential.
tonithomson5,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,Lots of rubbish in the water. However it‚Äôs a pretty beach üèñ kids enjoyed the few hours we had there. Has life guards !!
Kym P,"Baldivis, Australia",Jan 2018,We finally found it was a bit of a trek it was overcast the day we went and didn‚Äôt even get on the beach before a lady spotted us and tried to sell some sarongs.. 
Elly S,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"Seminyak Beach is much quieter than the famous Kuta Beach, a couple of cafes here n there. But there‚Äôs not much peddles plying n trying to sell you to buy their items. They are very calm n if you say ‚ÄúNo thanks‚Äù they will walk away.n leave you to enjoy the view n relax. "
Denis Y,79 contributions,Jan 2018,"Beautiful, fun, friendly wonderful and relaxing, truly this is paradise on earth. I don't know anywhere I would rather be at sunset. "
Anshul S,106 contributions,Oct 2017,"try avoiding this if you want peace and privacy. too many tourists and shutterbugs. however, lots of food joints nearby"
docmh007,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,Not the best place to surf but a great spot to have a dip in without going too far out (major rips) and nice to bodysurf back in
herilee,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Great restaurants surrounded and the white sands surrounded.. It is very good place to enjoy sunset in Bali!
Megan S,Canada,Dec 2017,Beautiful beach with an amazing view of the sunset but unfortunately during monsoon season tonnes of trash and plastic bags get washed up on the beach each morning. The locals are very good at cleaning the beach up from the pollution but it is still an unfortunate occurrence
rsaatlarge,"Birmingham, UK",Dec 2017,"The water is beautiful and the views of the sunset are spectacular.  However, there is way too much garbage on the beach.  And way too many people trying to sell you scarves and jewelry and hats, and do not listen and leave you alone when you say NO. "
Maria F,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,"Seminyak Beach is part of a very long breach that runs from Echo Beach in the North to Kuta in the South. It runs for MANY Kilometres (I'd guess 10Km, at least). The Beach is wide and easy to walk along. Surfing is mainly at the North end (Canggu area). For Western tastes, the Beach is not attractive or inviting. It is a ""dirty"" grey colour and more literally ""dirty"" from a LOT of rubbish on it. There are many areas set-aside for Hotel guests with Sun Shading and deck chairs. these areas are no cleaner, otherwise, the water and beachfront, are available to all. Be prepared to be approached by many vendors! For sun-bathers, the beach, in the Hotel areas, is fine. For Beach-walkers/runners, it's also fine. For Swimmers, it's up to your preference of ""clean"" water."
JohnT61,Sydney,Jan 2018,"I am going to be slightly negative about this beach, unfortunately. I heard a lot about this beach before I went and I was left disappointed. The sunsets, however, were magnificent every evening, but the beach itself was not to my liking. Coming from Australia, where we have such clean and beautiful beaches, I am left to compare my beaches to that standard. Seminyak beach was overcrowded with beach umbrellas and lounges for tourists. I realise this is normal for this time of year (January). But what disappointed me the most was the rubbish. There were tonnes of man-made rubbish scattered along the beach with no attempt by local authorities to clean it up. With the little attempt made by local shopkeepers to clean up, it was stored on the foreshore for the tide to take away. I can only imagine what Kuta beach would have been like.It was certainly a different experience. Seminyak Beach in Bali was unique, but for me, it's a place I really won't return to anytime soon."
chyland,"Uckfield, UK",Dec 2017,"We visited this beach every day in December it was very quiet as it was December. The people were amazing on the beach. The most disappointing thing was the accumulation of rubbish all day long that washed in from the sea. Some of the locals cleared it up first thing and then it was washed in again, a never ending task. It put me off this beach and sea as it seemed very dirty."
Flitz8-A foodie travels,"Athens, Greece",Jan 2018,"There's a lot of eateries along this beach and most go for sunset view along this coast,very busy beach and not cleanest"
Kunal B,"Jaipur, India",Dec 2017,I think the beaches in India are better than this. The beach was absolutely dirty and filthy except in front of the oberoi which they clean themselves. on seeing the beach I wondered why bali is rated so highly as a destination when the beaches are filthy and there is lots of traffic jam
Claudio D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Where to see one of the best sunset in the world?Bali...... At Seminyak beach.So, 5 deserved stars !!!! "
Glamp Bazaar,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,"This beach is beautiful and has lots of great waves if you're into surfing. Also great if you're a first time surfer they have tons of affordable surfing lessons and the waves are great but not so intense that it's a hard place to learn. There are great little beachfront restaurants and bars, and it's pretty easy to get a lounge chair if you go early enough. Negotiate for it and don't pay more than 50-100K rupiah for 2-3 hours. Sadly, there is a lot of trash on this beach. So walking along the water is not a great experience because you're dodging washed up trash and plastic bags. "
nitemist,"Canberra, Australia",Dec 2017,"Ok straight up here...the beach is horrible.  Why you ask...ill tell you...its polluted with rubbish that gets washed up due to the rainy season or due to tourists leaving waste on the beach.  Every morning we watched locals tirelessly try to remove rubbish, youd come back the next day and it would all start again.  Maybe were spot with our australian beaches and ecpectations that all beaches should look like ours but this was really sad.  Of more concern was that young children were allowed by parents to run tgrough the litter without a care in the world.  I can tell you know there is no way i would tramp through the litter to fet to the water let alone alliw a child too.  I wouldnt even enter the waters on this beach its just not worth it.Its not all gloom though.  Late acternoon tge restarants open up and you can have some great dri ks and meals on yhe beach watching the sunset.  Most cafes have their own music and the food is good (id recommend trying b9b we fou d them the best).  Go have a look at Semenyak beach but dont be mislead by images showing you thats its a pristine haven youll be dissapointed."
Nikita B,33 contributions,Jan 2018,The beach is nice and has a good stretch if you would like to walk. Usually in the evening the tide increases. Couldnt see any lifeguards nor is a beach for swimming as the water did not look very clean. Overall my recommendation would be to chill at the beach clubs/hotel facing the sea and not bother swimming in the sea - use the infinity pools out there. 
Pradnya_Kanekar,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,The beach is not very clean and the food stalls near the beach aren't very hygienic. If you have access to the beach through some villas r resorts then that portion of the beach is a must visit
Naomilee75,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,"So the 5 of us, (hubby and 3 kids and I) went for a walk on the beach around 6pm. The tide was out and all we could see was rubbish. üò™ There was so much rubbish on the beach being washed up, it was really sad to see. There were people everywhere and it just like it was so normal to them. It would be nice to maybe have more bins on the beach and make the locals and tourists aware of how bad it is to litter on the beach. Not only for the looks of the beach but also for the sea life. At breakfast the next day in our resort, I asked the manager if it was ever cleaned. He told me that the beach was cleaned every night. WOW- I was surprised. During that morning, we went for another walk and there was minimal rubbish. (Sadly, it was there again every night, but that did not stop the people coming in. ) The waves üåä looked amazing and many people were enjoying themselves surfing, swimming etc. We decided to just swim in the pool instead. The sand in front of The Royal Beach Resort was very grey, not the sand I expected. Nor, was it any good for making Sand Castles. Still a nice view though. üòäThis photo is more towards Seminyak where the sand got a better. This was also during the day. "
CuriousTravellerDXB,Dubai,Dec 2017,"Oh Seminyak, your streets in general were so well maintained but the public beach strip was a disgrace. I know that we were there in rainy season and the sea throws up more garbage than usual, but watching the tourist hordes also treat the beach like a dumping ground and only a few bars/hotels making an effort to clean up was extremely disappointing. I've lived and worked in Asia in similarly touristy destinations and this is the worst I've seen in a long time. Friends staying further along the coast had an entirely different experience so that's reassuring but we didn't even swim in the sea because of this. Bali, you are a beautiful island with beautiful people, culture and food. Please don't forget the beaches (and kick the butts of tourist litter louts!)."
Al_21_121,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,NY celebration on Seminyak Beach was a gr8 experience ....we experienced NY eve  on Double six and Seminyak Beach /the fireworxs were Insane a 2 hour build up then @ 00:00 global firworx from all three main beaches Legian Double Six and Seminyak beaches the fireworxs only stoped after 00:45 ....Lively party experience potatoe head beach and Cocoon had a private NY Bash with International DJ 's cover charge was 1.400.000 IDR
Tiaan le Roux,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jan 2018,One on the best beach in Bali. We hand a good time there. You can rent a seat or just enjoy yourself on the sand. Beach was very clean and had a bunch of friendly locals! Great for a bali sunset!
Angelika R,"Leichhardt, Australia",Jan 2018,"Wandered down to the beach with 3 kids, aged 9 and our twin 7 year olds and were skipping over the Rubbish floating in from the beach and swatting away people trying to sell us just about everything. I wouldn‚Äôt go back."
David M,Singapore,Jan 2018,"After staying a week at Seminyuk in a villa behind the W hotel, I spent each day walking/running between 8 and 14kms on the beach,The early sunrise views were beautiful, the air clean and fresh and you feel a million dollars when out and walking.The problem is the pollution, there are 3 streams that run onto the beach and the water stinks of sewerage when you walk through these streams. In addition to the water stink was the huge amount of plastic garbage on the beach as well as broken glass , I didn‚Äôt feel safe to walk on the beach without shoes on.The Bali and Indonesian government officials need to work out how to reduce the plastic waste and the open sewerage that runs onto the beach, it will really impact the tourists coming over if like me they feel the water is not clean to swim in."
paulaS6563UA,"Colchester, UK",Jan 2018,"Lovely walk along the beach and it was a lot cooler than walking through the town.  Nice hotels, bars and restaurants. Relaxing place."
boozybub,"Cleveland, Australia",Dec 2017,Was only a 10 minute walk from our Villa to Seminyak Beach and we only did it the once. Rubbish on the beach everywhere and to top it off were the two used nappies half buried in the sand. Left immediately and didn't return...chose the cleaner option of the pool in our Villa. Shame.
PetterLundgren,"Nacka, Sweden",Dec 2017,"Fantastic beach, sunset and waves .. but there is a need to clean the beach and water from plastics. That will significantly improve the experience. Long term Bali authorities need to consider this..!! From a Bali lover "
Daniel C,"Kalamazoo, MI",Dec 2017,"There are many resorts near this beach and quite a few restaurants right on the beach with lawn chairs facing the water. There is less trash than on kuta beach, mostly just a little more effort to keep it clean but still trash around. There are a lot of people but it does have nice sunset views and seemed to be a decent surfing spot"
Paul C,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"We stayed at Double Six, with a beach front balcony. The beach is nearly always lively. New Year‚Äôs Eve the front street is mayhem, which if you love Bali you‚Äôll be used to!We went to the rooftop club and watched the fireworks along the bay, amazing.The beach it self has a rubbish \ garbage problem, some say due to it being the wet season the garbage is wash down streams into the sea. Early morning groups clean the beach every day, but to no avail as later in the day the garbage is back.The water is murky and you feel garbage washing around you.Some hawkers, but not too pushy.Pricing in bars is on the high side, for Bali.There are nicer beaches in Bali for surfing and relaxing, the area does have a great selection of good restaurants though, and sunsets are good anywhere on the west side of the island."
jawa13,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",Dec 2017,"I stayed in Seminyak area and went to the beach for a run on around 8:30 AM. What I saw was shocking. The beach is full of rubbish and filth. Never seen a beach this bad even in India. Check out the photos. Clearly, this rubbish was not thrown by the beachgoers. It is washed out from somewhere else. It seems to me that Bal does not have a garbage collection/disposal system so everything ends up in the ocean. There was large cleaning crew with large machines trying to clean up. But whatever they do, all goes back to ocean. I had a very different impression about Bali before I went there. Old historical temples such as Lempuyang Temple are worth a visit, not the seminyak beach. Save time and go somewhere else."
Riebro,"Vaxjo, Sweden",Jan 2018,"Ok, it is the rainy season and it drag a lot of dirt to the beach and in the water. The plus is that you can find your place and the merchants on the beach are few and polite. "
LaurenceLG,"Doha, Qatar",Dec 2017,This is a pleasant place to lie and sunbath.The view is great as well and it is a good place to learn surfing. Yet as there are waves you might prefer another place for a dip.
Damien S,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"The last time that we visited was in 2009....fast forward to 2018 and the place has been cleaned up away from the beach. The restaurants and the shopping areas are not modern and a lot cleaner. The shop keepers do not pester you to purchase, if you want to look and buy then you are able to do so in peace. The beach itself we visited and there was a lot of rubbish on the beach. Given that it was just after New Years Eve this may have be part of the reason. I will be back in the future for sure."
Shannon B,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,My best friend and I went here to celebrate 20 years of friendship! We had an amazing time. Highly recommended. 
Paul S,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"I stay in Seminyak when in Europe it is snowing, raining, etc. I often go to beach to enjoy the sunset. It's always funny"
Leo R,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,I have yet to see this beach in pristine condition. Admittedly there is some attempt to clean up the pile of plastic that stretches the length of the beach but this is only done in the areas which are set back from the waters edge. Moreover the workers use rudimentary equipment are they appear lazy.Depending upon the time of year there can be dangerous rip currents so bathing beach flags should be followed at all times.
Kelly H,29 contributions,Nov 2017,"Heaps of restaurants to choose from, good for a run, massage, nice swimming beach, toilets and shower, surfboard hire $5 an hour ok for beginners. Be prepared to be hassled even when your eating a meal."
David T,116 contributions,Dec 2017,Had higher expectation of the beach but the waters edge was covered in plastic rubbish making it uncertain of what we were walking on and definitely did not make a swim inviting - beach in desperate need of a cleanup
Gill H,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2017,The time we visited the weather was pretty stormy and there were signs warning of rips!  Not a safe place to swim! However walk up to the Westin hotel and have a drink while watching the sunset!  Good people watching Place and nice and relaxing!
Enyele,"Zurich, Switzerland",Dec 2017,The beach itself is truly BEAUTIFULWe surfed there - the waves are perfect for beginners BUT: when we were there the beach and water was full of trash. What a pity. They reacted well and started cleaning right away as it seemed to be bigger problem (trash came apparantly from indonesian mainland/other island)Of course Bali is not alone to blame for this problem - yet truly something needs to be done or Bali will have a big Problem with tourism. 
Matthew C,6 contributions,Dec 2017,"Disgusting beach filled with garbage so sad.  Bali really needs to work on their garbage disposal.  A paradise vacation spot littered with gatbage that constantly washes up on shore, sad üò¢"
Monumental333,94 contributions,Dec 2017,The beach can get dirty but the get cleaners to clean it. The nightlife along the beach is buzzing. Alila has a great bar where you can listen to waves crashing. It is magical. Take a stroll on the beach. I did not have a dip but looking at the ocean at this beach was great.
Constance C,China,Dec 2017,"Seminyak Beach has many entry points.  We entered from the Polis Post in Seminyak (you can enter through Ku De Ta too) or one of the villas or hotels facing the beach.  Compared to Kuta Beach, this beach is relatively free of rubbish, water sports touts and people.  It begins to get crowded with people when you are walking on the beach approaching where Ku De Ta Restaurant is.The water sports costs are more expensive too.  In Kuta, you pay 50,000 rupiah per person (after bargaining) for 2 hours of the surf board; but in Seminyak it is 80,000 rupiah per person for 2 hours.   The beach vendors on the beach served better food though.  We did not feel like eating on the beach so we bought some satay (meat on skewers), fried banana pancakes and meatball soup.  The food only cost us 40,000!  The banana pancakes are 2,000 rupiahs each and the meat satay only 1,000 each! Unbelievably true."
AFehlers,"North Riding, South Africa",Dec 2017,As later explained by the locals due to wind and the time of year they experience large amounts of trash on the beach. It was difficult to find decent place to sunbath and swim. 
cerka,"Hastings, New Zealand",Dec 2017,Visited during wet season so the water was brown and the sand was littered in rubbish. We saw a used diaper. Gross.
darlygraham,"Tomar, Portugal",Dec 2017,"Been 3 times for surfing lesson. Myself and my partner learned surfing for about 2 hours each day, easy to rent surf board, we caught huge waves all the time and perfect spot for sunset."
Kalpesh P,82 contributions,Dec 2017,The Seminyak beach is ok types and not among the best ones.I would recommend to goto Padan beach or goto Gili Trawangan island and enjoy beach mood.
bb19872017,"London, UK",Dec 2017,"Luckily, I was staying at the W hotel so I had a great view of the beach. However, parts of the beach is very dirty and I only hoped the locals would clean it up"
Gay B,"Pattaya, Thailand",Dec 2017,Such a disappointment. The beach is guilty! Humans being at fault! Plastic rubbish every where. Beach vendors clean their patch constantly. But the next wave carries in more plastic. The sea is full of it! The beach vibe is good. Safety is managed by surf rescue. Beach beds are really good valve and the beach bars offer a friendly service of food and drink. 
Thelly76,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,We dropped by Seminyak Beach to see what all the fuss is about. Don‚Äôt be misled - those sands are far from White. If you‚Äôre looking for beaches of an Australian standard - knowing we are incredibly spoiled by beautiful sands and water - head to Nusa Dua Beach instead. 
LouTheShoe,"Leicestershire, UK",Dec 2017,"The beach was beautiful. The sea was quite rough so great for water sports but not so much for swimming. The only downside was the constant hassle from people selling things. If you say ‚Äúno thank you‚Äù they do generally leave you alone. Loungers and parasol available to rent but don‚Äôt take the first price, we fell for this on the first day and paid 200k rp for two loungers, on the second day we walked down the beach slightly and paid just 100k. "
KuDeTa,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2017,Seminyak beach is my beach for sport early morning Swimming and surfing on day timeThe best Sunset at 6 pm  by walking on the beach and enjoying 
Lim Ah T,4 contributions,Oct 2017,I know this beach when I stayed at Luna2 hotel because this beach is just 1 minute away from the hotel. It is good beach and good wave. 
bxbats86,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,"Unfortunately it's extremely polluted in and out of the water though there are huge efforts to clean the place up. I wouldn't swim here at this time of year, the rains churn up the surf and leave junk everywhere."
Karley67,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2017,"Don‚Äôt bother going to the beach here, instead, hire a driver for 600,000 IDR for 8 hours, and head down to Uluwatu for the day where the sand is white and the water clear."
788m_t_t,"Pomaz, Hungary",Dec 2017,"Friendly waves. Normal beach but not the Best. Lot of bars and selling people. Its not a must place, but you can spend few days there.  "
CongiaEnterprises,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,Regrettably tourism has left its mark on the shores of Seminyak. Debris from uncaring tourists is dotted along the shore. 
Chizzel,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2017,"I don't know what has happened in Bali but their beaches are full of rubbish.  It is deep with plastic bags, bottles and general waste in the ocean and especially on the beach.The only thing that made Seminyak beach a bit better is that they had tractors working furious trying to collect it.  Unfortunately as the ocean is full of rubbish, it just kept filling up. Tuban, Kuta and other beaches including Canggu were atrocious as this clean up wasn't happening as well as Seminyak. It really is disgraceful as the only way that much rubbish could be in the ocean is if it was being dumped.At any rate until this gets cleaned up or there dumping practises change I wouldn't  recommend their beaches. This was like this at the start of our holiday and it was just as bad when we left. Shame really."
singhbhavana04,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2017,Not good for people looking for peace or privacy. The beach is dotted with several good restaurants organizing DJ parties or live music.
Janie Low,4 contributions,Dec 2017,The beach was so dirty and the sea water was very dirty too. Wanted to have a tanning session over there but so disappointed when I seen the beach due to the environment there was so bad. It was so much worst than my expectation. 
Ngurah P,1 contribution,Dec 2017,nice beach i love it enjoy holiday if you want holiday in bali you must come to seminyak beachüòÑüòäüòâüòâ
Mark W,"Wallan, Australia",Dec 2017,I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve every seen Seminyak each and Kuta beach so full of rubbish. There were piles of it. Seems that this is the norm during the wet season. The beach was unusable. Rubbish floating in the water as well. 
Vinesh Pikale,"Panjim, India",Dec 2017,Don‚Äôt get me wrong it‚Äôs a nice beach but I‚Äôve seen far better. The sand is darkish and slightly coarse. Locationally nice. Has good restaurants on it. 
cass_bell17,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2017,Sunset over the water is beautiful however the beach is very dirty with rubbish etc. Did not feel safe having our toddler on the beach. 
djmontano,"Makati, Philippines",Jul 2017,"Coming from a country famed for its white beaches, I found the beaches in Bali unimpressive, the sand is dark and can get rocky. The tide and current can also get quite high so it's not the best for swimming."
adz_702,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2017,Go to the gillis if you want to swim as Seminyak is touristy with dirty beaches and price traps. The Gilli islands are GORGEOUS!
Aeagleaaron,"Phoenix, AZ",Dec 2017,I would say that Bali is not a place to go for beaches. They are very dirty. Well at least this one was. 
Seb L,"Tonbridge, UK",Dec 2017,"Not a swimming beach. Loads of trash in the water and washed up. In the more tourist sections they have loungers and do clear away the rubbish, but we took one look and knew this wasn‚Äôt a place to come and sunbathe/relax/swim. Go to a beach club... or a nicer beach."
Roscoe G,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2017,Might just be the time of year but we werent impressed with the beaches around kuta seminyak canggu areas. Not what we'd describe as idyllic or relaxing. Or what ine expects from an island vacation.  Locals were friendly though. 
laho758,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"Amazing sunsets, lots of activity on the beach with live music try to out do each other, lots of bars and beach lounges, too many people trying to see you stuff and lots of rubbish on the beach"
ROSSAtravels,"New York City, NY",Dec 2017,"Thanks to having a private pool at the villa we rented, we didnt have to rely on coming to this beach for swimming and or relaxing... The beach is just okay... Lots of people trying to sell u things which is bothersome... "
Kazm76,"Geelong, Australia",Nov 2017,"Didn‚Äôt enjoy this beach as much as one 20 minute walk down in Legian.  Seemed dirtier, sick dogs lying around. The guy to barter for sun lounges and boogie boards much more expensive than Legian and less willing to negotiate. Not as relaxing as Legian. After telling beach vendors ‚Äòno thanks‚Äô they would just ‚Äòhang out‚Äô at your sun lounge. No privacy!"
Philomena2013,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"Seminyak beach is the dirtiest of all that I have been to in Bali e.g. Nusa Dua, Sanur and Kuta.  The beach is littered with plastic bottles and other objects, clothings, slippers, etc. "
WorldTravla7,"Cairns, Australia",Jul 2017,"Seminyak Beach is one of the cleaner and more inviting beaches I‚Äôve visited in Bali (mainland Bali that is, the Gilis and Lombok have amazing beaches) and I enjoyed a few long walks and a swim with family. The surf is good for body boarding and catching waves as well (though don‚Äôt drink and swim if you‚Äôre inexperienced, my brother had to pull a guy out of the water who could have drowned). The water was nice and I didn‚Äôt encounter rubbish like I have before further south at Legian (there was a tiny creek flowing into the ocean to cross which was a bit dirty but that was all) and there weren‚Äôt many sellers or hawkers at the section where we stayed (just near Potato Head, Alila & Mrs Sippy bars). If you can get a hotel or villa in this area you‚Äôd do well as it‚Äôs not too overcrowded and it‚Äôs a quality stretch of beach close to some excellent restaurants and bars."
chiragkkatara,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017,This is an amazing beach one of the silent ones which gives you your own space too and never miss the sunset
Elena C,Cyprus,Sep 2017,"Bali is great and Seminyak is full of lovely bars, clubs and restaurants but the beach is nice to view and walk not for swimming."
Tella P,Jakarta,Dec 2017,"I visited this beach few days ago; it's pretty good - the view was awesome for Sunset. You can find some ""jagung bakar"" afterwards."
peter k,Plymouth,Nov 2017,"We went to the beach on two occasionsThe surfers were out on the first time getting some good ridesThe beach barer went to offered cheap lunches of good qualityBeach loungers were available and we paid 100,000 rupiah for two on day 1 and further down the beach 50,000 on day 2 (¬£6 and ¬£3 respectively)The busier areas further down the beach had an in water rubbish problem"
Luke C,"Issaquah, WA",Nov 2017,Spent 3 days at Seminyak Beach. Went in November when the rain washes trash into the ocean. It was quite dirty. Beach vendors can be a bit pushy as well.
ravifour,"Pearland, TX",Nov 2017,"I love the beach, it's nice on a hot as the water is nice an cool the place is teaming with people, drinks and family and kids playing, great place to enjoy the sunset"
Zoozoo_R,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2017,"The beach is good - a little debris around though, but still not too much. The surf waves here are awesome! Swimming in the waters here is fun - quite shallow waters with huge tides coming in.The cafe shacks on the beach are nice to lounge around in the evenings."
squerpans,22 contributions,Dec 2017,"a very nice beach to wear sunbathing, and a very nice atmosphere for a vacationüòämaybe next year I will come back here again, because I am comfortable to be here"
Sebastian K,"Helsinki, Finland",Nov 2017,"Even if there are cleaning crews, the beach is full of plastic, plants  and coconuts at low tide. The problem is not the beach visitors, it's likely coming from all around."
Luis G,"New York City, NY",Dec 2017,Very disappointed to find this beach so full of garbage.  Impossible to swim due to the amount of plastic bags and other things in the water.  The beach it‚Äôs also covered with so much garbage and the top of the cream was finding a needle on the shore... shame to all those hotels and bars for not being responsible of cleaning the beach 
miheledom,"Shanghai, China",Nov 2017,Along the beach there are a lot of resort and bars. We enjoy the view while sitting in on of the bars there. It is not that great beach at alll
Jim S,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Nov 2017,"Nice place to view sunset. Plenty of food and drink choices and some with live music. Not the cleanest beach i have visited. Annoying ""chinese lantern"" sales people, why buy these and add to the plastics in the sea."
kevin-ooioo,7 contributions,Dec 2016,"i love the sunset here, actually the beach is not so clean and it is crowded. But if you wanna see people and have some fun it is a good place. But if you looking for a nice and romantic place, then better to go somewhere else"
pkaran,"Pune District, India",Oct 2017,"If you are in Bali then do visit Seminyak beach. It is good long beach and it is neat and clean. There are water sports, beach chairs/beds for rent and several food and beverages options. Before the beach, there is a market street where also many restaurants are there. A day can be spent easily in this area."
Patrick M,"New York City, NY",Nov 2017,"Unless you've never been to a nice beach before, you will surely be disappointed and underwhelmed. The sand is not pretty and the water is not blue. I'm honestly very surprised that Seminyak is such a popular destination. There is absolutely nothing special about the beach there. If you told me I was at a New Jersey beach I would have believed you."
Handoko T,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Seminyak beach is the best beach Bali has, especially the northern side (Batubelig)....it is flat and wide...and moderate waves in the morning. Sunset could be good in clear weather. Very nice for morning walk from Kudeta to Potato Head Club."
ÏòàÏõê ÍπÄ,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2017,"There are a lot of sunbeds around the beach. The prices that owners call are quite high, so make sure you negotiate with them to get a cheaper price."
cafitzy,"Chinchilla, Australia",Nov 2017,It‚Äôs a long stretch of sand but there is no white sand & more rubbishy than should ever be present on a beach! It‚Äôs an entertaining walk though with a mix of tourists & locals with cold drinks available from beach vendors. The sunsets are apparently amazing but we experienced the start of monsoon weather but watching the storms roll in was pretty special. 
WW‚Äôs,"Greater London, UK",Nov 2017,First visit in January 2016 was great. Unfortunately in November 2017 the beach was dirty. Every day. Nobody clean it
Kylie W,"Portsmouth, UK",Nov 2017,I was heartily disappointed at the awful state this beach is in. It‚Äôs dirty and covered in rubbish both in the beach and floating. The sea is dark but becomes clearer the further you walk. But if want a scenic view for sun bathing this is not the one! If u want to collect plastic visit 
dordor-Sin,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2017,The beach was just infront of our hotel.   It was a clean beach with lots of sea sports but payable. There are a few hotels with this beach front.  I was staying at Royal Beach Seminyak Bali. 
Francisca-Jos√© Cruz Saavedra,"Vina del Mar, Chile",Dec 2016,"Lovely place, it's a big and long beach. Perfrct for surfers but no good to have a nice and calm swimming."
Shamim G,"Durban, South Africa",Nov 2017,I won't trust getting in the water here. Black sand with lots of debris. If you are looking for a good swim head down to Nusa Dua. This place is only suitable for the beachfront cafes and restaurants but not a swim
phoebefeld,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2017,"Wet Season is around October to March, (ish) at this time Indonesia rains and storms a lot. This brings out all the trash and rubbish and covers the beach in gunk. I was swimming and every wave that came past me I was brushed up by chip packets, plastic wrappers, and so on. The beach itself has barley any motoring which means it could be very dangerous to bring little kids. As I almost got caught it a strong rip, it made me realise there was minimal noticeable life guards or safety plans in place. There are many people on the beach selling you cool nicknacks (strange items). Only issue is they can be very persistent and will not leave you alone until you buy something. I personally felt uncomfortable leaving my bag on the beach while the ladies were lurking around. So I had to stay with my earphones in ignoring them until they finally walked away. "
GRAHAMMMCFARLANE,"Bedford, UK",Nov 2017,Wonderful beach at Seminak - everything you need is there for a great holiday experience - highly recommended.
Shelly M,"Mtunzini, South Africa",Nov 2017,"Our second day on the beach was a real treat, we went left instead of right which wasn't pleasant at all. So do remember to go left from Seminyak onto the beach. Our loungers and umbrella (which we had to pay for) was a saving grace for the day and we had a lovely lunch at the Samaya beach hotel. There are woman who give massages on the beach, and people selling all sorts of goodies. "
charliehill,"North Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,"This beach reminded me a little bit of my home country of Wales UkCloudy skies , dark (almost dirty looking) sand , and the sea didn't look inviting either!The bars with their bean bags and umbrellas were pretty and would have liked to have been there on a dry sunnier day and even for sunset as then this would have been better.Was expecting whiter sands in Bali but not this one. Such a shame , maybe next time it will look better"
Kajalkothari,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017,"Went to this beach for a stroll in the evening and to enjoy sunset on my first day in Bali. It's definitely got a good footfall, yet clean and serene.  So many shacks line up this beach with colourful bean bags on the beach to sleep and enjoy the view and drinks. The sunset is stunning.  "
Menekag,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2017,"We come from a country which is known for it's beaches yet we enjoyed the Seminyak beach very much. Sea was not very rough, therefore one could just go for a sea bath or just enjoy watching the waves roll in.... It is also a wonderful place to people watch!! Beach was quite full yet we had our own space as well."
Michael W,8 contributions,Oct 2017,A great spot to get a tan and have an icy cold Bintang. You can also learn to surf or even fly a kite. Plenty of people to give you a massage for only a small amount of cash.
Padillalawyer,"San Antonio, TX",Nov 2017,"Great beach if you want to just walk along, as the waves brush against your feet.However, not much in the way of sunbeds or umbrellas."
babesinlove,21 contributions,Nov 2017,We spent two nights here sitting under umbrellas watching the waves roll in whilst lighting laterns and stting them off into the night sky.You can enjoy a cocktail or a meal here while lounging on beanbag chairs or sitting in a restaurant.It was lovely.
kristi20172017,"Vilnius County, Lithuania",Nov 2017,"The beache was much more cleaner than I have imagined! beutiful view, nice colour of water, tendet sand, no any stone at the beache. Was interesting to notice women walking and carrying their goods on heads!;) Just too expensive to rent an umbrella with loungers (it cost for us 200 000 rph for 4 hours- like in West Europe!). "
hyunsuk y,2 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice white sand beach surrounded with a lot of restaurant, great location nearby Bali's Airport, we will come back next year"

Alan S,"Kettering, UK",Nov 2017,Fantastic huge clean beach with lots of sun beds everywhere ands loads of cool bars it's the best place on the island to watch the sun go down in paradise 
amandashe,Malaysia,Apr 2017,"The beach is not as famous as other beaches because it has lost its popularity due to cleanliness issue. However, this does not bother me that much. I just wanted to lie down and enjoy a sunset view. Lack of popularity now makes it slightly comfortable because it was not crowded."
Yod538,"Michaelston-y-Fedw, UK",Nov 2017,Great beach. Some traders are a pain. Restaurants on front very nice. Lovely at night. Big range of food and styles with matching budgets. Worth a stay.
OzHershy1,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2017,"The walk from Mr Potato Head beach club to Kuta will take around one hour unless you dally. Do the walks in the morning if you are an early riser to avoid the heat that comes with the sun. Don't forget that you need to walk back.Lovely walk on firm sand and wonderfully pleasant waves lapping at your feet. The walk in the heat of the day will be more strenuous so do wear a sunhat and do coverup and decidedly, slip, slap, slop on the suntan lotion.During the morning, the sun lounges and beach umbrellas appear as people arrive to sun and swin. The beach clubs and beach bars that spread all along the beach will serve drinks and snacks and some even serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Later in the afternoon, as the heat begins to dissipate, the locals arrive with children and dogs and the appearance of the beach changes. There will be  games of soccer  played near the water, babies will be laughing as the waves lap at their little legs. Lots of pretty girls taking selfies and almost as many couples doing the same. Guys watching the girls and girls watching the boys. The occasional dog believing it is human will lie down in the water and let the waves wash over it. Surfers gliding on the frothy waves and the odd fishing boat out at sea dot the panorama. As the light fades, live music can be heard from beach bars. Singers set up on mini stages with back to the sea face multicoloured bean bags hosting resting locals and tourists sipping drinks, chatting and chilling out. Later, after the music has stopped and the beach goers have gone and went the scene changes yet again. The odd surfer is still out there surfing  the glittering silver sea but the sand is almost deserted except for the odd couple strolling hand in hand. Sun lounges, beach umbrellas and bean bags have been  washed  and put away and only  rubbish remains which like magic, disappears by morning."
KazzaIpswich_Suffolk,"Ipswich, UK",Nov 2017,Lovely beach directly outside our hotel which was fab but there was a river coming into the sea which was full of rubbish. Think the rubbish will be a big problem if they don't do something about it. Ideal for surfers as big waves. 
Jacqui A,5 contributions,Nov 2017,coming from Aus the beaches here dont rate im sorry!  First thing I saw was a dead rate upon entry.  Sunsets are beautiful from a nice resturant
SMcAloon,"Western Ireland, Ireland",Nov 2017,"We didn't spend time lying on the beach here. Unfortunately stray dogs seem to be a real issue in Bali and they roam freely on the beach doing their business where they like with nobody to clean up after them! Not ideal. There was some litter lying about and in the water which was disappointing.This was a big wide beach, with some horse riding and huge waves. I would go back, and maybe spend a day relaxing and swimming."
Craig P,14 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice beach, sand is dark but cleaner and softer than i thought. The kuta beach is dirty and black. Walked and run every day. Very comfortable."
Dj_panda,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Nov 2017,"I like the waves it‚Äôs the best black sand and clean with 100,000 rent a chair and enjoy and it‚Äôs safe "
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2017,A good view on sunset as the sky turns orange and the beach activity turns into black silhouettes. Plenty of good vantage points. Try not to waste your money at a trendy overpriced bar. Its as if they have a liscence to charge high high prices just because of the free sunset.
Mitesh K,4 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice, quite beach. Couples & families can enjoy in day having surfing or laid back in sundeck. Rents for sundeck is IRD50k per head , bargain hard then only else price is too high. At Night one can enjoy gud live music/ band played by good performers. Once can have food & drink with lots of options to choose from ."
Kristeen R,2 contributions,Sep 2017,"What more can I say? Just wanted to be there forever. Lovely views and a great place for shopping if you choose to, but not too intimidating. "
Galuh888,29 contributions,Nov 2017,"Wanna come here again and enjoy the romantic sunset, the beach litle bit dirty. An silent after gunung agung issued."
Tartufi3110,"San Francisco, CA",Oct 2017,"The beach is wide, long and beautiful only if you don't look closely. There were dirty nappies, broken glass, piles of dog poop and other sorts of rubbish all over the place. We couldn't let our children walk barefoot in the sand, and we all were completely put off swimming, thinking the water was likely dirty as well. I write this review hoping that the local council and/or the beachfront businesses can organize ongoing cleanup and pollution prevention for the area, as that beach is a major tourist draw."
Petek999,"Barnsley, UK",Oct 2017,"This is a wide long stretch of beach. There are many beach bars along most of the stretch, all with bean bags, tables, most having live music nightly, and serving cocktails beers etc.There are a lot of street traders prowling the beach, many of whom don‚Äôt like to take ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer. They can be quite intrusive if you are trying to have a conversation.If the clouds are right, the sunsets on this beach are not to be missed, cameras at the ready, you will get some great shots here."
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Oct 2017,"First opinions when we got down there was very muddy and a lot of rubbish lying around, but when we got onto the beach itself it wasn't bad at all, they are building the sea wall and it is very nice and very arty, would love to see it when it's completed  and everything is built up by hand.lovely walk across the beach but even when it's not to sunny, please put some sun cream as you will catch it, even if you don't think you will, be safe,  stopped in a couple of bars on the beach and again impressed, the only thing that put me off was there are dogs roaming around and what put me off was one had a dump right alongside where we walked from the bar to the sea, nobody around the bar areas (owners) picked it up and disposed of it, we soon disappeared back off the beach, there are no laws about pets or strays on the beach but I would have thought the bar tenders who was watching at the time could have done something and I also know they have to go somewhere, apart from that nice clean beach once you are on it.   "
djmcenergy,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"The beach is really long, so perfect for early morning walks. Lots to see along the way with loads of hotels spotted it length. Loads of beach bars as well.  The sand is nice and clean and water refreshing...... but remember to swim between the flags as they do have areas with rips.  "
Moracc,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,I loved Double Six beach...good and comfortable...the lounges right at the front are a must....you get to enjoy the waves and people surfing. I found it very clean. 
Rajiv M,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,"We went here late afternoon in April. great vibe, people playing football, jogging, shacks were busy but not overcrowded. We read a rubbish near the beach and had low expectations but were pleasantly surprised, it was very clean. Beautiful sunset spot. Evening walk near the beach is a must!"
Greg C,"Narre Warren, Australia",Nov 2017,"Not much shade and a fair amount of rubbish, it's ok to walk along in the evening but in the heat of the day you will roast because of the lack of trees."
GizmoMC,"Frankston, Australia",Oct 2017,"Vast, wide beach that stretches for miles. The people watching is plentiful with an assortment of bars, restaurants & hotels along the beach front. Busy but clean & the sunsets are amazing! "
DebbyTravel1974,"Breda, The Netherlands",Nov 2017,"Nice beach, wide, many restaurants. Go for dinner at Sarong, Mamasan or Bikini. Water is not always fresh and clear, lots of plastic unfortunately."
foxie2006,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"Popular, good waves for beginner surfers. A small amount of litter but not overwhelming. Beds under umbrellas for which you need to negotiate a price. Bars on the beach side, good posi for a Bintang or milkshake. Be prepared for hawkers to which you will have to say a firm no thank you until they get the message."

Christina H,17 contributions,Oct 2017,"If you expect to go have a sunset view, this place would be suitable for this. There were less people selling stuff, not like Kuta beach."
Fattums B,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2017,The waves were astonishing.  The men on the beach who offer day beds are genuine and accommodating. Not a lot of garbage but I suspect that may change as there isn't a dedicated person to clean it. Overall great location with beautiful sand and waves 
Bells1000,"Stockholm, Sweden",Aug 2017,"Seminyak is pretty hectic but the beach is wide and you will find a decent spot to relax on. The more north you go, the more quiet it is.  The water is pretty wavy and the sunsets are beautiful."
Leo Z,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"Perhaps because of the pending Volcano eruptions, Seminyak Beach was deserted. There were some shops on the shore but nothing eye-catching, and the sand, unlike Kuta Beach, was dark and coarse."
Alan_Bligh,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,Nice beach but the level of rubbish was shocking bad during this visit. I remembered it to be much better before.
JenHappyDays,27 contributions,Nov 2017,"I'm in love with Bali.. great beach, beanbag bars , live music, amazing sunsets ( don't get caught with people offering foot massage, we paid ‚Ç¨12 small money but you can get a full body massage in a spa for ‚Ç¨9) "
coralgb,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2017,Changed my mind on the best place to stay in Bali...its THE BREEZES SEMINYAK went to walk through JAYAKATA when there in June its very old and rundown now
adrianaB5381ON,"Essex, UK",Nov 2017,"The beach is amazing. It‚Äôs everything you‚Äôd expect from Bali. The sandy beaches are wide, and it stretches for miles. There are bars and hotels and restaurants dotted along the beach and the sunsets are to die for. The evenings are brought to life by performers from the bars and it‚Äôs somewhere you‚Äôll never forget."
Poonam K,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,We went when tides were mostly high so the red flag was up a lot. The sand is beautiful. Only some parts of the beach are badly littered. 
Abang Lexa,"Jembrana, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Just walking with my new fliper itu was so clean and beautiful sunset , but you must keep clean also at there because , Local people at there is really love they beach"
Macdariens,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,"Went for a walk on the beach and the stench of sewage is pretty rank, also not that fond of seeing usedCondoms coming in with the waves and on the beach. That said if you can find a good spot out of the whiff of sewage it‚Äôs a great sunset. "
Andrew H,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"We love going to Bali, but the beach is not the attraction.  We have a walk on the beach every morning, but you  need to watch out for garbage on the sand.  Nappies, syringes, glass.... Really sorry that this is not getting any better."
pnssnp,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2017,the beach is very clean here even though it is visited by scores of people and the waters with myriad shades of green and blue make it a very attractive place to spend time at

Tomislav M,"Zagreb, Croatia",Oct 2017,"Like title ...very big sand ,very nice,clean beach.Also good for surfers but when we are there was no big waves."
Roberto,"Carrara, Italy",Oct 2017,Worth a visit! Beautiful walks; surfing; very nice bars on the beach for a drink! Enjoy the sunset here! 
linzai71,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,We went there a couple of times in the evening to watched the sunset and it was near our hotel. I‚Äôm not sure if this beach is good for swimming but it is good enough for a stroll along the beach in the evening and to watch sunset. 
Kristyrae79,"Kingsley, Australia",Oct 2017,"The atmosphere along this beach at night is what Bali is all about! The bands, the drinks, the food and the bean bags all add up to a fun relaxing end to your day, Or a great start to your night. Either way, if you're in Seminyak you must go down to the beach and spend sometime enjoying what they have to offer down there. Keep up the good work! "
MateEeMa,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2017,"A disgustingly dirty beach full of trash! I would never in my right mind spend time at the beach yet alone swim there!! It was bad 7 years ago when we first visited Bali, now it's just purely disgusting!"
saim1961,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,Just a short walk where we stayed is seminyak beach. Forget about Swimming cause the wave is too high and red flag everywhere.Nice to go for a stroll and sunset view.
Wael A,Doha,Sep 2017,"seminyak beach , is one of the best beaches in bali, we went there for a day trip, and was amazed how clean is the beach, a lot of people are surfing, and many water sports."
Lani F,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2017,"Best place to relax with a cocktail and watch the sunset. The sand is a little coarse as it is volcanic, so don't wear white."
recidivist8,Makati,Oct 2017,This beach area of bali is suitable for surfing for the beginners. Waves are pretty ok for surfing. There are alot of bars on the shore and alot of surfing instructors. 
Y8719REmarcon,6 contributions,Oct 2017,e like Seminyak Beach because it is clean and inviting for walks and jogging and it connects a number of beautiful hotels/restaurants with easy daytime and night time.walks
nayda62,"Ulverstone, Australia",Jun 2017,"Had my sons wedding in Bali, so relaxing, looking forward to going again.Balinese folk so welcoming, shopping and restaurants a hive of activity."
rufusatmarton,"Middlesbrough, UK",Oct 2017,The beach at Seminyak is not its finest feature. At certain states of the tide there can be rubbish and rain in the hills can wash natural rubbish down the small streams that cross the beach. There is a fairly steep shelve in certain areas which means that you should watch small children but the proliferation of surf schools means that there are experience people on hand at all times. Red flags seem to mean nothing
Girl with Wander Dreams,"Kumarakom, India",Oct 2017,"The water and the beaches are really very clean. Although haven't seen a lot of surfers but still come ppl did learn there as the waves are small. The beach has all amenities like shacks, restaurant with live bands in the night, private beach clubs and shops around to buy anything u want from beer to medicines. "
YSchreut,32 contributions,Oct 2017,It's a very nice beach to watch the sunset. It's very popular under the locals as well.Swimming is dangerous and the beaches are not the cleanest but even with that you can have a nice (long) walk.Only big disadvantage I found is that a water out of the city ends up into the sea at different points and it's hard to continue your way without putting at least 1 feet into it.
Kim K,12 contributions,Oct 2017,"Beautiful beach and could be more beautiful, if people did their part and picked up after themselves. We need to keep our oceans and land clean.  This area is a little more quiet then Kuta and Legian. My new favourite spot. "
SkinnyPufferFish,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2017,"I used to love coming here to sit on the beach and enjoy sunbathing or watching the sunset. I came this month with my friends and was disgusted by the rubbish found on the beach from start to finish. It was filled with plastic bottles, tin cans, plastic bags, cigarette packets and other rubbish. This is not suitable for children, fish or the environment. It‚Äôs disgusting and I‚Äôm appalled this is the condition it‚Äôs been left in. "
Teresa P,44 contributions,Oct 2017,Great for Long walks. Long stretch of sand. Cleaner than expected. Fantastic sunsets. Go to the Breeze at the Samanta hotel for a drink at sunset. Amazing seating and views.
Bernadette C,24 contributions,May 2017,Great day for just sitting under a umbrella having a few drinks with friends Many restaurants across the road to enjoy lunch then enjoy the rest of the day relaxing with music drinks and good company intill the sunsetsBeach sellers make it more interesting with buying gifts that after a few beers you may never of bought but very cheap just makes the experience and you can have a little fun.Worth a visit to make the holiday experience. 
Compass623049,19 contributions,Oct 2017,"Beautiful sunsets, worth going down the beach for sunrise and sunsets, great location and lots of seating along the beach "
Terese L,14 contributions,Sep 2017,the sunsets along the beach here is stunning there are plenty of places to relax have a cocktail and watch as the sunsets not too bad for a dip in the ocean on a hot day either 
Rasika V,Mumbai,Oct 2017," Beach is clean, good for an evening stroll. Not many bars around, so it is peaceful. Waves are strong. Some services that offer surfing classes. "
Ritu G,43 contributions,Oct 2017,"seminyak market is good but beach is unclean.It is just like Mumbai choupathy.No water activities are there.If going to seminyak,then one can visit.otherwise there are very good beaches in bali."
GINCHONE,"London, UK",Oct 2017,If you want to witness stunning sunsets go to Semyniak beach! For day time is nothing special and I would not recommend for little children because the waves are huge most of the time . 
David H,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Oct 2017,Good beach in seminyak. Very Hot in seminyak beachMany people in the world in hereGood palace happy in this palace. I Like seminyak Beach with my Family
BrightSide101,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2017,"Fabulous bars and restaurants along this section but still plenty of room for families to play, and dogs to run around.  Not as many hawkers and bars as in Legian"
dillymix,"Ulsan, South Korea",Oct 2017,"A chilled beach with a cool atmosphere. Beanbags, shishas and drinks served all day. The hawkers can be a little pushy but certainly not a too much of a problem."
Slucyd,UK,Oct 2017,Seminyak Beach is lovely. It's fairly clean although it could do with some rubbish bins along the way as I picked up a couple of bits of trash but couldn't find anywhere to put them! The sand is lovely and the water was warm every time we got in. We didn't surf but it looked fantastic for that and easy and affordable to hire a board or get a lesson. There are lots of beach front hotels and restaurants and the views are just always gorgeous!
Michael F,"Mount Annan, Australia",Oct 2017,Beatific sunsets beautiful location. Friendly locals and great little bar areas. Great restaraunt are everywhere and world class.
monika s,"London, UK",Oct 2017,"The beach was a good place to surf, but it is the beach to watch that the tide is in for that. If you go to a shop you will pay 1ml per person for a lesson, but we got a lesson from the boys on the beach and it was a very good one for 500k for the two of us and we had a trainer each.Beers and other drinks are very cheap on the beach"
Pat A,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Aug 2017,"Found the rubbish was a bit yuk,that floats from the water ways.The kids loved the water.Walking along there at night time around sunset is beautiful"
the travel writer,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2017,I love Seminyak beach!!!You can walk for ages...or runGreat surf beachgreat cafes and restaurants along the beach fringeGreat patrolled beach
Austy1971,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,Shame but the beaches were pretty dirty when we visited.  We didnt mind because we had our own private pool at our villa
DeVries1976,"London, UK",Oct 2017,The Seminyak beach is clean and not as crowded as Kuta and therefor more attractive to us. Plus just a few minutes walk from the hotel
Nihit,"Surat, India",Jun 2017,This beach is more chilled out compare to Kuta beach . I went here in morning and had a good time here ... it was all quiet & sand & sun ... nice for a walk or sit on the sand during dawn / dusk.   also easy to reach
Leslie,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"Entire stretch of smooth sand with old and young enjoying themselves. Children playing in the sand, splashing with water. Youths were flying kites. People were walking or jogging on the beach. Some surfers were surfing the waves. The sunset was worth waiting for to get that perfect shot. "
Lynn T,"Tokyo, Japan",Oct 2017,The beach seems to have more garbage as time goes on...this trip the garbage seems very excessive.. wonder if from sea or otherwise.  very smelly and bad
Elke M,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2017,"Standard tourist beach in Bali. Dark coloured sand but clean beach, a lot of people and activities, including a range of water sports. Lots of locals selling products."
Jules A,2 contributions,Oct 2017,Ok I stayed here. Nice place just giving you a review of the actual beach....it's. it that nice. For example just north of Potatoem Head beach club it is littered with rubbish (My kids refused to swim at Seminyak).  Not sure if the currents push this up form the south beaches. Kuta and Legian are nicer beaches. Kuta is jam packed with locals trying to sell you something so it may be this reason that people are moving awAy from Kuta beach. Legian is pretty good .... clean and much less locals trying to sell you things. If you are thinking of having a rest on the beach best to take your sunnies off and close your eyes and that way the locals leave you all ne
Gareth F,"London, UK",Oct 2017,Really nice long and deep beach. Don't expect spectacular beauty - not really blue seas or really white sands. Great sun and places to stop for a drink.  Some litter on the beach and a slightly off putting stream running near the restaurants.
Rani75,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2017,Semiyak Beach..... Beaches are always relaxing. Swimmer's enjoy this beach bcoz of waves. I would advice children and non swimmers to be careful as this beach is uneven and the waves are harsh..
Gavo308,"Success, Australia",May 2017,"Most beautiful place to watch the sun go down. Nice and relaxing with bean bags everywhere...Great music ,live..only problem was after ordering a drink the waiters seemed to have disappeared..waiting over twenty minutes for a drink and another fifteen for our change..Be prepared to be hassled by hawkers..."
Guyinherts,"London, UK",Nov 2016,"An amazingly long beautiful sandy beach, loads of different bars hotel etc along side it and you can come off it right into the centre of town. "
Debasmita C,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2017,Seminyak beach is equipped with many excellent bars and clubs. The beach is really beautiful. It's beauty doubles during sunset. We enjoyed every bit of the sunset from Seminyak. Loved it.
BhaskarM,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2017,Beautiful clean beach in Seminyak. Enjoy sun bath in sunny day. Popular among tourist and easily accessible. 
Lisa K,4 contributions,Sep 2017,Needs to be swept/cleaned. Beautiful sunset. Lovely restaurants on the water. Can learn to surf. Locals very friendly people. 
Jack Dandy,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"Lots of places to chill along the beach ie coconut stands, seats and beanbags. great waves awesome for surfing and really clean beach! "
Ellyhuis,"Phoenix, AZ",Jun 2017,"It was only 10 min away from our hotel. I enjoyed going to the beach there, it was clean, private, not too busy, the water is rough. "
tinabrian_12,"Wirral, UK",Oct 2017,The beach is mainly for surfers. You couldn't swim in it as it would be totally  unsafe. The shower at the opening of the beach stank +++++ and didn't even work.Well at least we seen it but we didn't  return. 
Chloe200000,"North Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Plenty fun things to do and see on beach incl drinks lounges parties but not a pretty or clean beach. Dirty water, brownish sand. Also full of dogs in all sizes!!"
523paulot,"Lisbon, Portugal",Jul 2017,Nice beach with rough but warm sea. I love this warm waves. Lots of bars and restaurants at the sea side. Beautiful sunset and all the bars get prepared for a vibrating night.
venusbirth,"San Francisco, CA",Oct 2017,This is NOT A SWIMMING BEACH  and I am staying around the corner so I am not happy.I love ocean swimming and will be going to the Sunday Beach Club to try to find a swimmable non-fllthy beach.LOTS of people wandering around selling stuff and the typical trying to hustle tours off of tourists .... it is excessive AND THE GARBAGE WOW just WOW this is a SURFING beach and the balinese kids were killing it this AM
cherylsass,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"With the bars facing the sea and bean bags on the beach, we were spoilt for choice. There are also umbrellas with sunbeds for rent. We preferred Seminyak Beach to Kuta Beach. It is obviously less crowded, and sellers do not harass you much, except for a few of them who approach you selling pareos, accessories and paintings. Besides that, it was a very peaceful day out under the sun. We spent the whole day on the beach having beer after beer til sundown. Nice waves, nice water, it was perfect! The beach was clean which is important. We reckon the staff from the beach clubs are instructed to keep the beach clean to keep customers coming back. Music and the sound of waves crashing on the beach was the perfect combination while getting a tan or over a game of cards. If you want a less crowded & cleaner beach, choose this beach over Kuta Beach anyday. "
kmmellalieu,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2017,Had a beautiful day at the Beach. Nice Beach good waves and close to a lot of things. Can hire seating if required friendly people 
Alexandre D,"Sao Paulo, SP",Oct 2017,"I loved this place even though it is not the most beautiful beach in Indonesia. The place is worth it for its vibe and people. The sunset is one of the Earth‚Äôs wonder. It is really worth to see it. There are children on the beach, but be careful because the sea is kinda dangerous. "
KatePe,Melbourne,Sep 2017,"A beautiful stretch of beach, offering an abundance of bars along the way, meaning you can stop anywhere to enjoy an ice cold Bintang whilst watching the amazing show that is a Bali sunset. Our favorite thing to do in Bali is wander down here, grab a bean bag and a drink and take in the spectacular show that never fails to disappoint. "
ozboz2016,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,Comfortable beautiful beach. No where near as hectic as Kita and legion. Very pleasant and a lovely little bar for drinks and snacks
Jenni W,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Aug 2017,"For anyone looking for a great beach to spend a few hours, or the whole day at when in Bali you can‚Äôt go past Seminyak Beach. Day or night, it‚Äôs colourful, fun & totally beautiful. Food & drinks are available from the beachfront cafes, Juice Park is my fav, or from the friendly locals who serve you right at your sun lounge (which you can hire for an hour or the whole day very cheap). Make it a ‚Äòmust do‚Äô in the night to buy a lantern from the local sellers on the beach (they will help you light it) & make a wish as you watch it rise up into the night sky..... very special üíúüåõüèÆ"
AuroraSeabreeze D,"Drapetsona, Greece",Sep 2017,"The best beach at Bali!!!!!!feeling free of everything!!!!you ll find perfect sea to surf unstoppable!!!coctails,music,swimming,diving,is all you need at a huge beach!!!!!"
Wies,"Best, The Netherlands",Sep 2017,"Great beach, good waves and nice water.Great place to take some surfing lessons from the local people, to swim and to relax."
PhilJackie2015,"Huntingdon, UK",Sep 2017,This is an extensive beach with all the amenities for hire from surf boards to sun loungers.  Viewed for just an hour late one afternoon
Claudiu U,29 contributions,Oct 2017,This is mostly a tourist beach. There are a lot of families with childrens. At night every bar has a live music band
LondonEbay_Queen,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"I had been told the beaches in Seminyak were stunning so I tagged a few days here onto the end of my trip.  I was slightly disappointed (and shocked) at how dirty they were though. I walked along the beach for an hour or so collecting shells before finding a beach bar to sit and watch the sunset.  In that time I saw a lot of accompanied and unaccompanied dogs ..... and with dogs comes s**t.  I saw more of it on the beach than I've seen on any other beach anywhere.  Not impressed.  In addition to the doggie issue, there were used nappies and general litter scattered all over the place.  There's no excuse for this and I just kept walking until I found the clean stretch I decided to settle at for the sunset.  Needless to say I was very careful where I stepped on my walk back towards town...."
228Kevin,"Cairns, Australia",Sep 2017,Seminyak is an extension of Legian and Kuta but not as busy. Had nice waves the day I was there. The beauty is having a drink watching the sun set. Could do this every night.
Jessica M,36 contributions,Sep 2017,My husband is a keen surfer and loved surfing at the beach. I just went to sun bath and relax which was nice. Not many families swimming at beach as waves quite big (is a known surf beach). The locals work very hard to keep the beach clean and I could see them cleaning on a daily basis. Lots of loungers out but you have to pay to use.
Charles R,3 contributions,Aug 2017,"First time visit this Beaches, we felt really noise with beach boys who always interrupt our Holiday in the Beach "
sueau54,"Macleay Island, Australia",Sep 2017,"The beach is really great with waves for the board riders either just starting out learning, or for the more experienced . There's heaps and heaps of people trying to flog anything they can. What was disappointing was the hawkers are teaching their young and very young kids how to do it..very off putting..The toilets you have to pay for now, they collect the money But they do Not Clean them that was more than disappointing.."
hazejagergabriela,"Ettalong Beach, Australia",Sep 2017,Just had a beautiful holiday in Seminjak. The beach and surf was great . Lifeguards on duty most of the day. The beach was mostly clean
Patrick Sarj,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Sep 2017,"Great place to watch the sunset/sitting on the beach drinking Heineken with mates. Fantastic views great waves , nice beach .  People everywhere. Lots of Indonesian people selling there bits and pieces on the beach. Overall a nice spot to sink a few cold ones before heading into town for the nightlife. "
Tyan B,Southbank,Sep 2017,Not a nice beach and busy as well.Much rather stay in the hotel resort pool. Quite nice for an early morning walk before breakfast 
Loullabelle71,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2017,"Great to walk along in the early mornings, don't be afraid of the dogs .. as they don't go near you at all!  no swimming at this beach, as in SEP 17, too many rips didnt allow.  Hubby dipped in quickly but found it to be extremely salty. Nice to look at, nice to walk along and that's it."
OJ_1999,"Amersham, UK",Aug 2017,"We did not have a bad time... but not the best beach in Bali, and quite dirty in places. Evening light was pleasant and we left when the beach was gearing up for the evening party..."
lovetotravel386,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2017,"Beach is dirty! Don't go to Seminyak looking for nice beaches. They have litter on them, stray dogs, etc. Don't get the hype. "
JJOH,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2017,Back when I was at primary school I remember seeing a to programme ('Watch') that featured Bali and it looked like paradise. Long time ago that but I'm now here at Seminyak Beach. Perhaps not the place it was back then and although nice enough I have visited many many more attractive beaches.Sand is lovely and fine but volcanic so quite dark in colour. It's a huge expanse of sand with little natural shade but there are rows an rows of sun beds with umbrellas like in Italy which I don't like. Hence for me it's paradise lost
Marjen183,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"We strolled along the beach in the late afternoon, with the tide well out. There were a lot of people on the beach, but not many in the water. The sand was a grayish colour and we had to step in smelly drain water on two occasions, which is obviously more apparent at low tide."
Suzophrenic,28 contributions,Sep 2017,Expensive pop up pubs and restaurants line it now . Ordinary beach . Wouldn't go back no tropical paradise here . 
Siphiwe,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Sep 2017,"Lovely beach with warm water and not to many traders. My only issue is the lack of dustbins and a place where you can wash after swimming, at the very least there must be a small tap where you can rinse off your feet. "
Kezzasboy,"Mildura, Australia",Sep 2017,We went down here walked along beach the sand isn't the pure white more a chocolate with shells. It is flagged for swimming and it was rough the red flags indicate a rip be careful. There isn't a lot on this beach which is good the water wasn't cold. It's ok
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,"Seminyak beach has to be on any Bali checklist. The Sunsets are super colourful with the umbrellas of La Plancha adding up to the scene! Good music, cocktails and vibes overall at the beach. "
"emma,sean d",9 contributions,Sep 2017,Loved the beach here spent whole day lounging around Plenty of great food on offer . Also didn't get hassled as much as in kuta
MissPP89,"Birmingham, UK",Sep 2017,Really big waves- would be good for surfing. Sand is fairly fine. No where to keep our stuff so had to take it in turns going in the sea
FledgeColac,"Glen Iris, Australia",Sep 2017,Certainly a great spot to watch the sunset but is spoilt somewhat by the amount of rubbish near the waterline and in some places along the top of the beach.
Rod B,82 contributions,Sep 2017,"Do not go to Bali beach expecting Golden Sands. Seminyak Beach is no exception, the beach is clean and the water warn, surf is ok but that's where it ends. Vendors  set up beach beds and hawk them for 100,000ir for 2 . Then once you are settled the hawker approach aggressively selling anything from beer to kites, surfing lessons to towel hire. Our choice was to use the resort pool where we were staying . Far more comfortable and hassle free. If you are not staying at a resort with a pool ,use the beach but be prepared for the price you must pay for being a TARGET TOURIST"
aleksbt,"Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia",Sep 2017,Best place to enjoy the gorgeous sunset while relaxing on sand loungers. Bit overcrowded with many sellers pushing to sell staff
KandAPandora,"Bristol, UK",Aug 2017,"This was a good beach for us because we wanted to do some surfing as beginners and we're looking for consistent waist deep foamy waves and sand all the way out. This was a better bet for us than the beach at Canggu where the surf was too messy for beginners in August. There may be somewhere better for beginner surfers... Surf board hire 200,000 idr for 2 hours for 2 boards and rash vestsIt stays shallow here for some way out but the waves can get quite big. Not so good for swimming.The beach isn't the cleanest but only in the respect that there is the same run off into the sea as you unfortunately find on other Bali beaches. Unfortunately, like many beaches in Bali you will also find lots of polystyrene balls chocking the sand from the burst beach bean bags put out for tourists to use."
nadiasarif,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"We were greeted by the locals offering the beach beds. We chose one with 100,000 Rupiah for 2 beds. The beach was clean. Everyone was friendly. It is definitely not as crowded as Kuta. The beach is a good place for those who prefer lesser noise and disturbance."
David F,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,"If you're expecting beautiful white beaches and swaying palm trees forget it. Instead you get dirty sand (and the sea doesn't look too clean either). No change rooms or toilets, and just about the entire length signposted ""for surfers only"". If you want to go in and cool off no choice but to ignore the signs. Loads of tacky souvenir shops, eateries and bars plus outrageous prices to hire the deckchairs. On the other hand lots of ""Bali watches"" for sale, some of which might even still be working once you get back on the plane!"
maggietynan,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,It is over 35 years since I last visited Bali and I could not get over the transformation.  The sellers on the beach were more controlled - they did not hassle - just there in the background and would descend only if encouraged.  It actually meant you could enjoy  the beach.  A big contrast from when I was last there
Christophe C,"Senlis, France",Sep 2017,Amazing long beach with many nice bar. Really nice to enjoy the sunset there and have some drink after. Looking forward to going there again. 
Suzanne K,17 contributions,Sep 2017,Seminyak beach is very busy and the beach itself is a little hard to swim in.busy with the locals trying to sells you goods.you can buy a snack or a sorang on the beach.
raina646,"Boca Raton, FL",Sep 2017,Beautiful beach üåä great waves. There's a lot of broken glass on the beach so be extra careful when walking around. Wasn't overly busy so that was a treat. 
vipula m,"Northampton, UK",Sep 2017,"Very nice beach bit crowded and brown sand but quite peaceful Very high waves Not many places to eat at the beach I liked it, did not get bothered much there by any one to buy stuff"
Michael,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2017,"Lovely beach, but just like any other sandy beach! It goes on for miles though! Wonderful walk along the beach where you pass many bars to stop off and have a drink and sun loungers to chill on and catch a tan!"
jastuewe,"Milwaukee, WI",Sep 2017,"We stayed in Seminyak for a week and absolutely loved the beach!  We walked the beach every morning before visiting another area.  We also spent a couple of days lounging on the beach with coconut water or a mixed drink.  Beautiful beach, beautiful view.  It was a little dirty and didn't have any garbage cans."
Bill And-Kerrie H,"Victoria, Australia",Sep 2017,The beech is well maintained with lots of local hawkers adding to the ambience.  Hire a beach couch and watch the waves roll in with a Bintang or grab some surfing lessons.  The beach hawkers will sell you (try to sell you) lots of stuff you don't need but that's part of the scene here.   Sunset anywhere along the beach is great.   Only a short stroll to the Seminak Village Square.  
AuntieSober,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"Nice and relaxing beach. Next to La Lucciola, Potato Head and other local and international cafes. Night life is lively with many people around."

Everyday_Spartan,22 contributions,Sep 2017,"Great beach to watch the sunset from and chill out in the day, good for surfing in certain sections, but not great for swimming. "
Shai Vicky,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"Dark, fine volcanic sand beach. Wide expanse at low tide. Great sunset views.Red flag signals a no-swimming zone, due to the strong current.Red and yellow flags indicate that you can swim there.Decent crowd on the beach at night enjoying live music. Everything ends before midnight. No all-night party-goers."
Mark H,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,We were in Seminyak in September the sun set around 6:15. The beach has many bars with bean bags to sit on & chilled music. Great place to umwind.
Glenn Nicholls,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,"A nice place to sit at relax but I would not go swimming as between La Lucciola Restaurant and the car park there is a stormwater sewage canal that enters the beach and the sea, how ever if you go down to the beach for the sunset grab a drink and a fresh corn sit on the beach and relax"
Cerin C,"Clovelly, Australia",Aug 2017,so beautfiul and amazing sunsets. friendly people and good enviroment  would gladly go back. very calm 
Papamoabill,"Papamoa, New Zealand",Sep 2017,Not the most inviting beach I've been touch. Had to cross sewage contaminated lagoon to get to the ocean and would think twice about swimming in it. Looks nice though. 
Wanderer,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,My friends and I went to take a swim and realized that the sewerage water leads directly into the sea. Please do not swim. Disappointed that the beach was filthy!
Paul L,"Nijkerk, The Netherlands",Sep 2017,We went to the beach to swim but saw a surfing rental. we paid 200k for 1 hour lesson and 1 hour free practice. great waves and good surfing schools! a must do!
Greg C,"Cape Paterson, Australia",Sep 2017,Seems that this beach is great for surfing and relaxing upon - not so sure about swimming as the gradient is low.
Trina Moore,"Ashburton, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Nice beach, even better in the evening to watch the sunset, so many restaurants offering colorful seating along the beach. Such a nice spot"
Tom S,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2017,"Really nice beach located a 5-10 min walk from seminyak sq. lots of things to do, hire a surf board for an hour (50k-100k) hire a body board (~50k) do a surf lesson for an hour (200k and we got to keep the board for an extra hour). We also had sundowners outside the anantara hotel which were great. Very reasonably priced drinks for what is an excellent location to watch the sun slip into the sea on some rather comfy beanbags!"
Louise P,"Reedy Creek, Australia",Sep 2017,But not to swim in ... rips and currents make it too unsafe to do so.A very long stretch of beach which allows you to look at the other hotels on the beach. 
R. Layne Holley,"Memphis, TN",Sep 2017,"For some reason, I delayed travel to Indonesia despite visiting so many other countries in SEAsia, some more than once. Now that I have finally experienced Bali's Seminyak Beach area, it has suddenly reached the top of the pyramid. It is my new First Choice destination. The beach is very wide. The sand is fine and glistens in the sun. The ocean winds seem constant and is refreshing from the heat. Shelling is possible in a few areas but don't expect much on that front. The surf is robust but far more so to the north. Hotels, resorts, beach cafes and on-the-beach bars are prolific. There's a few very, very polite beach peddlers who are not at all pushy. It's a superb area any beach lover. "
Amr E,"Cairo, Egypt",Sep 2017,You got multiple options1. Sit on a bean bag and have a drink2. Sit on casual dining tablesSo many restaurants to select from with nice price and quality food. $10-$15 for a meal for two
Jodeacon,"Reading, UK",Sep 2017,"Huge beach with a great atmosphere. It's very clean and lovely comfortable sun beds (200k IDR for the day)The waves are quite strong so not really for swimming, but great to enjoy messing around in the surf. Without a doubt the best time of day to visit is late afternoon - there is a great laid back atmosphere and the beach offers amazing views of the sunset. There are lots of bars along the beach - all with beanbags where you can relax and enjoy the view with a couple of Bintangs! Also great to stay into the evening as there is lots of live music to enjoy "
bikomigo,Sydney,Sep 2017,Preferred to stick to swimming in our gorgeous resort hotel and watch the sunsets from there.  Coming from Sydney didn't think Seminyak beach was anything special.  Enjoyed our swim at nusa doa beach instead.
ariesnz,NZ,Sep 2017,Enjoyed beach walks at the end of the day.  I found the beach looked very different compared to mornings.
Karen O,"Sebastopol, CA",Sep 2017,Nice beach. Not the best surf. Restaurant/bar area right on the boardwalk. Didn't really impress compared to other beaches but there were less people coming up to your chairs selling stuff.  Kuta and canggu were better surf but non stop selling of goods. 
JanPat2013,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Aug 2017,Enjoyed lots of walksOn the beach Lots of people about some on chairs and loungers enjoying the sunsets.Good views along the long beach-front.  A 'must visit' at and before sunset!!
Peivven,17 contributions,Aug 2017,"We went to the beach outside potato head beach club. My 3-year old son loved it and we stayed for an hour and a half! It was extremely hot, but we rented the beds under the umbrella for 100,000 IDR an hour and enjoyed a coconut drink. The sound of the waves were lovely and my son enjoyed playing sand under the umbrella. "
Lovablezed,17 contributions,Jul 2017,"Really enjoyed watching the sunset here, great atmosphere and vibe. We walked along the beach and there are a number of beach clubs / restaurants that you can sit at and watch the sunset from whilst drinking a beverage of your choice. "
alfismont,"Bath, UK",Sep 2017,Enjoyed playing in the surf here and bartering for sunbeds .. keep walking and you will get a good price 
Annieinsaudi,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Sep 2017,We loved our long sunset walks along the beach. It's quieter than other bali beaches but still has life to it. 
jjbaby1,"Buderim, Australia",Sep 2017,"Worth a visit, definitely a tourist destination. Beach filled with locals selling their goods and sun beds"
Johann M,2 contributions,Sep 2017,"Very nice and quiet. If you like a lot of people and loud vibrant scene, then this place is NOT for you. It's very lad back. Even the waves ate pretty calm. Great for someone learning how to surf. Pro surfers will NOT like this beach. "
SanghasUK,"Alton, UK",Aug 2017,"I walked the whole bay from Kuta (southernmost point) to Petitenget beach (northernmost point). Best place I found for family was just north of Jl Camplung Tanduk (the road with The Royal Beach Hotel). When you get to the beach turn right and about 200 M is a place to avoid the masses, a bit quieter, Sunbeds are around 100,000 Rupiah on the beach (¬£6)"
swnj_1701,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2017,Great fun to be had with the sellers on the beach. Sun shinning everyone happy. Can't wait to return one day. Fab atmosphere on this beach. Not to busy during the day but comes alive at sunset.We walked along the beach to Kuta we didnt like it there way way to busy stick to semyniak
Ooi C,3 contributions,Aug 2017,Beautiful and Nice beach.The sun is hot.The chair from the beach Rupiah 150000 is costly.No massage on the beach?
Palak J,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2017,All High end Resorts and great view. Very clean beach ..great view of Sunset and close from Seminyak square mall.
kevin d,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2017, Nice beach but very busy Not the greatest for swimmingFantastic night life along the beach Set up for dining drinking and music if thats your passion
Hadi R,79 contributions,Sep 2017,You definitely want to watch sunset when u are in bali. The view and the breathe are fantastic. U can enjoy the wind and the view. I was there the other day to witness the sunset and i am blessed that i was here. Its a place that you want to be at least once in ur lifetime. 
aircsi,"Phoenix, AZ",Sep 2017,"Had heard many different stories about this beach and in our experience for four days it was excellent. It was clean, weather was fantastic, and the beach boys were very helpful in securing us beach lounges. Very nice and fun beach."
Jason C,"Taguig City, Philippines",Aug 2017,"I'm from a country (the Philippines) with incredible beaches, if I may say so myself, so my expectations about Seminyak Beach was a bit high. It was okay, but nothing more and nothing less.The vendors peddling beach chairs and umbrellas can also get in your nerves if you're unprepared for them. I recommend haggling low, then working up to a compromise."
Prem T,delhi,Aug 2017,Good clean beach. The waves are very strong in evening and not feasible for swimming. There are not many independent restaurants along the beach as most are the ones owned by hotels on the beach. 
Dabsi0905,Bregenz,Aug 2017,At Seminyak Beach you can enjoy beautiful sunsets in one of the beach bars but you can also rent a sunshade and a sun lounger and stay there for hours. Beautiful beach!!! 
UriaChen,"New Taipei, Taiwan",Sep 2017,"There are many restaurants and offer sofas at the beach , drink cocktail and watch the sunset with your beloved one."
globetrotter1392,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"Good sandy beach, relatively quiet with mainly dogs wondering along the sand. Very little to do here but perfect for lying in the sun. "
nancyabdelsaid,"Harrow, UK",Sep 2017,"Seminyak beach is lovely, though it doesn't have golden sands and crystal blue seas, it was still a lovely and clean beach where we spent hours relaxing.In the evenings you're almost certainly guaranteed a stunning sunset which is worth the wait for.Very calm,peaceful and tranquil.Really enjoyed staying in a hotel just beside this beach "
joembre,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"This is a busy, thriving beach. The temperature of the sea is lovely. Rated only 3 stars as it has way too much rubbish around the roads and so many stray dogs. What is really nice is everyone is chilled and happy."
555steve,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"Great scenic beach in Bali. Black sand and plenty of the tourist stuff (beer, soft drinks, fake tattoos etc). Typical beach in Bali but a bit quieter than Kira."
TravelExplorer193,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"People always talk about Bali sunsets. The waves were very heavy , so not too much swimming. However the wide beach was the perfect backdrop to a stunning sunset"
FabianP1998,"Upper Austria, Austria",Aug 2017,Really loved the sunsets there. Lot of people though at certain parts. Definitely put it on your todo list!
Argya N,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"It is definitely not the most beautiful beach, however the sunset was really nice and there were plenty of beach lounge to relax. Not as crowded as Kuta and had a wide sandy shore to walk by during the sunset. Probably better to went there by foot since it was hard to find parking lot and it costs 15k rupiah for parking car (domestic tourist here)."
lbbarb,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,Very disappointing sand is dark water is alot colder than i expected and water very average. Wouldn't bother coming here to swim..
Julia S,4 contributions,Aug 2017,"This is a strange beach - it goes on for miles and miles but it's not like the beaches of Thailand or other comparable locations. The shoreline is very very shallow, so you can walk out about 100m and the water is still only up to your waist but the currents are very strong so you can only really swim between the designated flags and even then the waves will smash into you. The sand is dark and very fine (so pretty sticky). However, the sunset is beautiful and it's a great place to rock up, sit on bean bags with a Bintang at the end of the day. Also great if you want to go to any of the beach clubs and get the best of music, pools and the beach,"
Alula S,"Depok, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"I like the beach because not as crowded as kuta, the sunset also gorgeous. only one thing that make uncomfortable are the lady that selling accessories/ offering massage really insist and aggressive."
KANKARIA,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2017,"An enjoyable beach but not the kind of white sandy pristine beach. If the resort/hotel where one stays is contagious, then it can be more enjoyable. "
Kristine M,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2017,"We have been to the beach a number of times now. Just walking & enjoying people watching. It's great for anyone who enjoys the outdoors. The beach is clean & apart from the hawkers selling their wares, it's very relaxing. You can sit on the sand for free or hire a lounge with/without an umbrella, there are also been bag chairs - free if you get a drink or plastic chairs same same. Evening time sees it all come alive with music & sunset (not to be missed). "
Aoife M,"San Francisco, CA",Aug 2017,"Great beach with lots to do on the beach, beginning surfing lessons can be given by locals for 250rp for like 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Water not at clear as you would hope but lovely all the same "
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,The sand is black and the sea is so wavy! Not suitable if you want to have a swim but definitely good for surfers! 
Rachael S,"Beccles, UK",Aug 2017,A good fun beach to visit if you like a bit of atmosphere! The sand is fine and there are plenty of sun loungers. Even though it is very very busy there is plenty of space as it is so big. People come here to surf so the ocean is full of surfers. Therefore you can not swim in the ocean.
ShellB49,"Houston, TX",Aug 2017,"The combo of the town's raw sewage flowing into the beach water, plus dangerous currents and waves which prohibit swimming make this a terrible beach for tourists."
JCSport1,"Wollongong, Australia",Aug 2017,"After we hired our scooters we headed down to the Beach for a Bintang or three at one of the bars and then went back again for Tapas that evening. This place is sensational, we were also treated to some of the best live DJ music mixes we have ever heard that evening, do not miss Seminyak Beach when you come to Bali!"
Jessica A,"Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia",Aug 2017,"great time, enjoy a beer and just relax for the sunset time, also you can rent a surf board and try it "
Trevor J,33 contributions,Aug 2017,This beach is great compared to the beaches closer to the Kuta area. There is minimal rubbish and the water is clear.
Iain P,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Jul 2017,"After visiting this area and the positive reports on this beech we were dreadfully disappointed. The locals that offer there sacrifices to there gods all wash up on the beach, OK we have to be respectful but really!What made it worse for us is the garbage that washes on to the beach from local water sources and the packs of dogs that roam around the beach and the crap that they do not bury or their owners do not pick up.So beware!OK the sunsets with corn and Bintang are beautiful works of art to enjoy each night but please be careful"
melrowan,10 contributions,Aug 2017,"It was definitely one beautiful beach, but we were kinda disappointed as it was nearly overcrowded! Not that we didn't have a good time at the beach... But I prefer a bit more peace! "
vivifang99,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,Love the beach. The sun. The sand. The view. The smile. The food. Love the people that come from different country :) having the same interest..... sun bathing .... yeaaahhhhh
Becksmartin,"Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Really vibrant, tonnes happening - awesome spot. Hire loungers on the beach by day and sip on a Bintang on a beanbag at night and watch the sunset. Or enjoy one of the many hotel bars or beach clubs along this beach. "
SEIJR,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Aug 2017,Disappointed with Seminyak beach. Really surprised how expensive the lounge hire was considering how cheap everything is in Bali. The average cost was 400IRP per day for 2 loungers and a umbrella. This is about ¬£23.Also the beach area near Ku Da Te we found it to be really smelly and the water very dirty. There are a couple of water outlets which come out into the sea here causing these problems. But if you go towards Kuta it seems to be fine. 
Ascolovesla,"Vancouver, Canada",Aug 2017,Unfortunately garbage had washed up on shore. Otherwise beautiful and expansive. The water isn't crystal clear like Hawaii.
EllenOnVacation,California,Aug 2017,"Not a nice beach to hang out with family.  There was some type of dirty water dumping right into the beach and it smelled like sewer.  The foam was actually brown!!There were dogs defecating everywhere.  The designated area where there was suppose to be water for rinsing off was non-operational, with no water."
noorar744,"Helsinki, Finland",Aug 2017,"Nothing special, like the whole Seminyak area. There was a weird smell at the beach and towards north it was a bit trashy. Big waves so no swimming. Sunbeds were expensive (100)"
totallyNotRoman,"Kuta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Don't know how it used to be before but it's too overcrowded with tourists now. And annoying, fat, richer ones too; since it's kind of expensive and filled with resorts. The beach itself is a simple flat one with sandy sea access without any fauna and just the resorts. It's on the west side so the sunsets are nice though."
gvodbos,"Mechelen, Belgium",Jul 2017,"Nice sandy beach with lots of wind surfers.  Too many waves for swimming though.  And yes, sunset is great, especially with a beer at one of the many beer stalls."
v1ck12014,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,You can walk forever because there is. A bar every 50ft and walking is thirsty work.  Loads of beach activities. 
Allie I,"London, UK",Aug 2017,Beautiful! I'd recommend everyone to have a stroll down black sand beach. Lots of lovely places to eat and drink on the each for great values Very strong current if you want to go in the water so be careful  but great waves for surfers. Lifeguard loved his whistle! 
Janel F,"Cape Town, South Africa",Aug 2017,"Great beach , good vibes! Loads of restaurants on the beach to choose from! You can rent sun lounges from IDR100 000, bintangs in the beach tend to be cheaper than from the restaurants. "
Cornelia T,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"when in Bali, you do not want to miss out on the best sunsets ever. Just go anywhere on Seminyak beach, have a drink and enjoy the beautiful spectacle ."
Rhea R,14 contributions,Aug 2017,"Water is more for surfing but, nice place to just hang around.Chill!Nice shoreline.Decent amount of crowd as well.Quite a private access/entry point.Perfect if you stay at Grandma Hotel Seminyak."
Thomas K,Paris,Aug 2017,"Lovely beach, some hassle but not too much. Sunsets and evenings on beach bars are a must! If you want peace- head north."
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",May 2017,Loved the beach.  Had fun playing in the sand and the waves - Really nice beach and truly gorgeous views of the ocean. 
Helsim2017,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,Clean beach lots of kites not too crowded with lifesavers and lots of places for drinks and snacks  along the shore 
Rebekah F,5 contributions,Jul 2017,We really enjoyed the atmosphere of Seminyak Beach. Our teenage kids thoroughly enjoyed boogie boarding and eating on the beach. Hire a sun bed and enjoy.
guildfordians,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2017,Nice to look atBeautiful peaceful beach walk on the sand. Not swimmable unless your a surf life saver or extremely experienced swimmer. Please listen to life guards and swim between flags as the ocean can be unforgiving The sand is a dull grey so not the white beach you may be looking for . But for beach walking it's beautiful  
inVINCEable77,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,It is a must stop if you are in the area. If you can make it around dusk would be ideal as the sunsets are amazing. If you want an excellent beachside relaxation stop and are not in a resort that has Beach access then find your way down as it is something you will not regret. 
ThaiTraveller2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,We stayed at The Royal Beach witch has direct access to the beach and what a great section of beach it is.With lots of bars and places to eat you cannot go wrong and enjoy the sunset.
CiaraNiC87,Ireland,Jul 2017,"The beach is vast and glorious. You see many activities taking place here and can purchase many things from your towel such as scarves, jewellery, food and drink. Surf lessons are offered and both surf boards and body boards are available for rent at a decent price. You can also hire beds near the hotels. When we went 'swimming' however we struggled with the size and ferocity of the waves. It was great fun trying to body surf the waves and I'd totally go again. A close eye would be needed to be kept on children in and around the water. "
DanRoppelt,"Hamilton, Canada",Jul 2017,Loved the waves and the water. Suitable for swimming but dont venture out too far! THe undertow can be strong at times
Mohamed I,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2017,Seminyak beach has a very clean sand and easy access. The sunset is an amazing moment at this wonderful beach.
Rita Lee,"New Lambton, Australia",Aug 2017,Like Bali in off peak times otherwise too many idiots and crappy shops would rather stay in cannggu love it there
Nikhu B,7 contributions,Jul 2017,"Music, drinks and chairs to relax in the evening, Seminyak is the best.! We stayed in Hotel horison so it was convenient to walk down to seminyak beach. Also, double six beach is just beside to this seminyak beach. There are many restaurants oppo to these two beaches. Pretty good time if you looking to just relax and get a peace of mind with friends and family. "
Mary N,"Hong Kong Island, China",Aug 2017,"We had stayed in Nusa Dua and Jimbaran Bay before and loved this section of Bali at Seminyak near The Legian as the beach is long, sand is soft though not white. You could walk all the way along all the hotels, resorts, restauranrs, bars and surf! Surfing class is 200,000 rupiah, rental is 100,000 and boogey board is 50,000. Wave is great and our teenage kids ride on the wave on their first class! Would definitely stay here again next time!"
Karen M,"Kirup, Australia",Aug 2017,Very busy but quite spectacular! Took our young children and they all enjoyed running along the beach and playing in the sand. 
MersMajid,"Paris, France",Aug 2017,"Despite the crowd - we still love this place. Even though it is starting to feel like an European resort - we hardly see many Asian tourists , which is a pity. Sunsets are really fantastic"
Ï§ÄÌòÅ ÍπÄ,15 contributions,Aug 2017,"Lots of quality restaurants around. Nice weather, waves and kind ppl. Little bit expensive to rent sun beds."
Silindile Dube,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach was always packed with tourists. The water is not too cold, you can hire chairs to relax at the beach. It is clean and there are guides."
lmb1989,"Phoenix, AZ",Aug 2017,Clean pristine miles of hotels and privacy along the coast. Great surf for intermediate or better surfers 
Jensbertelsen,"Sauveterre-de-Bearn, France",Aug 2017,"Meh! üòê I am no Globetrotter but I have travelled the world fairly well and I do love I do love a beautiful sunset, yet this one will not rock my world for sure.Been there, done that, didn't buy the t-shirt like the 3000 other people there.Verdict = Tourist trap.I am sure there are better places to watch a sunset in Bali and I will look for it next time here."
aspearce,"Goolwa, Australia",Aug 2017,Loved chilling out eating dinner and having drinks in the bean bags on the beach watching the sunset.  Get there early though 
Jimmyjack2440,Crescent Head,Jul 2017,Beach 66 at seminyak is the best place in Bali to relax & chill out. With restaurants on the beach & cocktails all day to live music at night it's the place to be to chill out & unwind. 
Jorge M,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,"The Indian ocean waters are beautifully warm in Bali and the waves not big enough to torment anyone. The beach itself is not particularly beautiful and cleanliness not its key feature but it is great for long romantic walks and we felt very safe even at night. Walk south east for the eventful surfing areas, north west for the quiet spots. "
Oscar A,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2017,"I am just reviewing Seminyak Beach ( Marriott hotel beach). Its been a long time since we used to holiday in Bali. but over 10 years ago, Bali beaches were polluted (full of rubbish), fortunately, this have changed now, beaches are clean. This in itself, will play a big deal for our next holiday destination."
TheJape,"Graz, Austria",Aug 2017,"Beach is fine in terms of views, but its not for swimming, if you are surfer you will probably enjoy it. Anyway if you are looking for place to chill and swim do not go here."
Hannah W,8 contributions,Aug 2017,Did not like the beach at all. Was very over crowded and just full of sun beds. There are however beach clubs you can go to or places similar to this. I think it lacked culture. 
CJO193,"Te Puke, New Zealand",Aug 2017,A nice walk along the beach.. a long stretch of beach with good surf.. a few locals selling products along the way 
Skinnychef2014,"Hoboken, NJ",Aug 2017,"Loved my surf lesson - so much better and cheaper compared to the US! The beach is clean and very beautiful, cool but not freezing water, and the cafes along the beach are great."
chamboNsw,NSW,Jul 2017,"This beach is used for many different things, religious ceremonies, family group outings (on Sunday as it's their day off), and of course for tourists parading their new swimwear!   Every few metres is a bar, some have food others have loungers, and a lot of them have public toilets.  Some charge a few coins others are free.    On our last day we noticed groups of workers on the beach collecting litter and debris from the previous days' high tides.  Nice to see."
scott s,17 contributions,Aug 2017,Once upon a time this beach was fabulous and a place to watch the sunset orange over the ocean. And I'm sure it will be again once the Balinese gov discover the benefits of sewage treatment...
ShahFam,"New York City, NY",May 2017,We went to Seminyak Beach twice. Both times at Sunset. Beautiful view! The beach is clean and family friendly. The fresh corn available at the entrance...not to be missed.
olivia h,"Petersfield, UK",Aug 2017,The beach in Seminyak is okay. It's not the best but it's not bad. The waves are very strong so you have to be careful when staying there. The sunbeds sometimes get waves underneath them as the tide comes in very fast and far. However the location is very good as there are lots of restaurants and market stalls near. 
Mai M,8 contributions,Aug 2017,Corse sand and rough waves don't be fooled by hustlers selling seats a towel is still a great ideal. People selling aray of small gifts for your friends back home. Restaurants near by and drinking allowed whoah
717vipink,5 contributions,Apr 2017,"Beaches of bali are best in the world. There is zimbaran beach where you can go for the evening fun, there will be live shows and open restaurants where you can enjoy."
Mav,"Hong Kong Island, China",Aug 2017,"The beach have everything! Nice place chilling with frds, with beers, sunset and food!! Some restaurant got live band :)"
shoque31,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"Lovely, kids loved the day. Tide is really strong, so hold onto the children. Downside, beach chairs can be very expensive, so best to bargain and or take lots of towels. Could not find anywhere to wash feet once off the beach. Also, quite hard to get hold of a licensed taxi (bluebird). Recommend, but be prepared if with children"
bitsagra,agra,Jul 2017,The beaches are small and crowded but clean. good place to drink and eat alongside. Sometimes too many vendors spoil the fun but overall good experience
ArizKohli,Mumbai,Jul 2017,"If you like your swim in the sea a little bit on the rough side this is a great. Kid took surfing lessons, the waves and current were a bit rough; we were immediately warned and pulled back whenever we ventured a bit too deep. The beach is clean and so is the water, don't know why some visitors have expressed otherwise. I loved it."
Debbie V,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"We parked ourselves at Mumma Rondas chairs over a few days during our stay. She is one of the loveliest most helpful and grateful ladies I've come across. Chairs with umbrella cost 10NZ for 2. She has fresh fruit salad, 3.50, Bintang and other assorted drinks including fresh coconuts. You do get the Hawkers trying to sell to you moreso if you sit in the loungers than on the beach. As the sun is so hot I would recommend grabbing a sun lounger and fending the hawkers off. Waves were too big for body surfing for us but we still had fun. There's a public toilet across the road, very stinky but find me one that isn't in Asia!!"
Blueyonda29,"Stockport, UK",Jul 2017,"We visited this beach several times on our trip, both during the day and the evening. The water is clean and the sand is soft. The beach was busy but we always found a sun lounger to rent or a space in a bar. This beach is a must in the evening before 6pm to watch the sunset whilst sat on a colourful beanbag with cocktails in hand. A real experience with music and the hustle and bustle. There are many beach vendors selling various bits and bobs, we just learned to wave them off and not be bothered by it. The water is too choppy to swim but great for paddling or body boards etc. We read reviews before our trip to say the beach was dirty but we found this to not be the case. We ate there several times and found the food to be great, but a little pricey in comparison to off the beach. "
lynn n,"Cebu Island, Philippines",Aug 2017,"Not really a picturesque venue....But the massive waves are good, brilliant for surfing especially it being so close to Canggu. However if your here for the ambience lol yeah just get a bed & drink coconuts lol..... You'll need it. Also a bit crowded so but well, at least you get the beach"
Laura G,"Newport Pagnell, UK",Aug 2017,The beach was good to watch the surf as there was lots of massive waves ideal for surfing but there is no swimming along much of the beach and lots lifeguards.Many many bars along the beach that get very crowded at night.Beach is not ideal for young kids as sand dirty and the waves are far too big for the kids to be able to swim.
RAVSHARAN,"Patiala, India",Jul 2017,The beach is clean and nice . But the tide timings should be kept in mind . The tide timings differ everyday . Its available on the resorts on the beachside like potato house and W.
SydneySider1983,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2017,"There's not much going on here. Sand is dark, not the prettiest beach. Head to a beach club or a lovely pool instead!"

dbwteach1,"New York City, NY",Jul 2017,"Nice large Beach area, but not very clean. The sunrise/sunset views were the best. We had a short walk from our hotel to the beach. It wasn't immediately obvious how to access the beach, but we did find an entrance pass the police station. There was a lot of activity in this location, there's a place to rent scooters and enjoy street food. There was a lot of people in the area selling local fair. The grilled corn stand with the brown sweet butter, drew a crowd."
Marina S,69 contributions,Aug 2017,Huge endless beach with many activities going on... from surfing  to horse riding and live music... amazing sunsets good vibe fun and relaxing at the same timeüòä
paras j,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2017,The beach is clean and nice but the facilities not too good. Kuta beach or Nusa dua is better and more fun  
Karthik Shankar,87 contributions,Nov 2016,"Great views and waves, one of the best surfing spots in the world! Its always vibrant with lots of restaurants by the beach, plenty of activities going on, enjoy a game of football or jump on to a karaoke machine and sing away. For those who seek quiet just stroll down the beach away from all this and sit on the sand and enjoy the sunset!"

Hans N,"Haarlem, The Netherlands",Jul 2017,"This beach disappoints. Small coffee bar. Waves to surf, but I did not see anybody doing it. Not too many people around. Prefer Kuta beach."
jean,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2017,A good beach minus all the crowds and food stalls of kuta. Good for sunset views too. Potato head beach club is very popular here
Aqem A,"Melaka, Malaysia",Jul 2017,"Seminyak Beach,¬†jalan Raya Seminyak, 24 hours.¬†Seminyak Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach situated in north of Legian Beach. The white sand stretch 3 km from Tuban Area has made it as a fascination for tourist to visit this place. Seminyak Beach is favored by the great wave that is ideally for surfing adventures hence many surfers visit this beach to conquer the waves and enjoy the surf adventures. This beach is also featured by beautiful panorama to the Indian Ocean, the wide white sand, complete public facilities, the word class hotels, international restaurant and more."
Claire Annand,"Kent, UK",Jul 2017,"Seminyak beach is a nice large beach to walk along with lots of bars / restaurants to enjoy. It is not an overly clean beach - we come across a lot of dog poo! And the sand isn't golden white. We wouldn't attempt to swim either as the sea is very tidal and wavy. However, it has beautiful sunset views, is lovely to walk along and is very wide. It's definitely worth a visit but it isn't your relaxing beautiful Caribbean beach."
SDL5965,"Queensland, Australia",Jul 2017,"Walked along the beach every day we were there.  The waves crashing in are just amazing, no wonder there are so many surfers there. Sunset was breathtaking.  A lot of people selling things on the beach from jewellery, hats, sunglasses, kites, canvases etc.  if you sit on the bean bags on the beach or at many of the bars on the beach you can be pestered constantly.  At night the beach is lit up with colour from the umbrella lights and the neon hanging lights.  Bands play at the bars and it's certainly worth a visit or two."
mcgetty,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2017,"Seyminak Beach is beautiful when you first see it. The waves are crazy and it is a long and impressive. However, I was a bit disappointed as it was pretty dirty in places and sewage smell was also quite strong in certain sections. Also I was there in July and there were massive crowds. I would save my time for the beach in a better place on the island than here."
TKazz,"Aalborg, Denmark",Jul 2017,"Our daughters were up for trying surfing and according to locals here, it should be Seminyak, so we hired a driver and went to the west coast.Water was more waves than east coast (Sanur) where we stayed.We found a place with some goid lical instructors and the girls had fun surfing for a couple of hours.Price was 150K for approx. 2 hours, so ok.Also great clean sandy beach and at least this day no plastic and rubbish lykng around.So overall a great day at Seminyak beach."
Swati S,4 contributions,Jul 2017,Food is delicious. Place is Awsm. Nd the most beautiful is I enjoyed a lot there. When I go with my frnds.  ...We enjoy soo much. 
acsaroj,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2017,"Just like your regular beach, nothing to write home about...not so crowded though at about 5 in the evening...good for a nice stroll..."
Astronaught,"Mijas Pueblo, Spain",Jul 2017,"We visited Seminyak beach in 2007 and the place was a haven of tranquility with the locals swimming and fishing in the ocean. Fast forward to 2017 and the beach feels like the gold coast of Australia, so busy and not the place it was. That said, I guess it's progress and it's a lovely long beach, but there's nicer beaches in Bali."
auberswell,"Harlington, UK",Jul 2017,"Excellent locationClean, beautifully appointed, spacious room with superb views over the sea. The friendly and very helpful staff made us welcome at all times. The breakfast buffet was extensive and if you could order from a menu in addition to the buffet.Would happily stay again. "
Parisa,2 contributions,Jul 2017, we had sunset dinner at the beach with an amazing view definitely recommend. The food might be a bit expensive but it is well worth it . 
HelandRich,"Nottingham, UK",Jul 2017,"The beach itself is not the best out there, we found it to be quite clean but I think that is dependant on the tides. The best thing for us about this beach is that you can walk up and down long stretches, particularly as the sun sets. It is nice seeing people go about their daily lives, kids playing football, making kites, locals running and walking their dogs. It has a relaxed vibe. We didn't visit any bars or clubs, but if you're into that then I'm sure you'll find plenty to amuse you here. "
azoz a,2 contributions,Jul 2017,"Amazing sunset in this beach , and very cool for swimming and surfing There are a lot of bars and horses riding "
dixiepeach,"Kansas City, MO",Jul 2017,This beach is a nice one overall.  The waves are beautiful as they roll in.  It could be better though if pet owners were more responsible about cleaning up after their dogs.
darren a,5 contributions,Jul 2017,"The beach has big waves - good for those who want to try surfing. Sand is not so white but the view is okay. There are umbrellas and benches that you can rent if the sun gets too hot. There are lots of tourists when we visited since it's summer, so it's kinda crowded. You can also run along the coast if your hotel is just nearby."
B P,"Iowa City, IA",Jul 2017,"If you go there expecting white sand beaches, you will be disappointed.  The sand is brown.  The water is somewhat green, not like the exotic beaches in Mexico or Hawaii.  We just walked a bit and left.  "
Maree F,2 contributions,Jul 2017,"Great, love beanbags at sunset, amazing massage by wendy watching all colours of the kites flying high, and surf lessons brilliant"
Jecajess,16 contributions,Jul 2017,"Crowded, dirty, strong tides, and just could be better. People bring their dogs and they are playful with anyone.  Dirty! Empty coconuts and garbage, a better effort should be exorcise to keep this place cleaner.  Too much money is request for a chair and the people in charge can be rude, they want their money! "
Deb L,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Jul 2017,"Loved our morning walks on the beach, watching the dogs play, surf school, and the people going about their business. Busy place but also beautiful. A great way to start the day. "
11Cab11,Brisbane,Jul 2017,"Enjoy sunset cocktails and snacks here on bean bags or table and chairs  on the sand. Prepare to be harassed by sellers of kites, jewellery and kids toys"
NafeeTA,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2017,"This beach although more crowded, its pretty long and has some very nice restaurants lined up near the shore. One can relax here while getting some pretty good grub too"
RPathare,1 contribution,Jul 2017,Beautiful place. Good experience. Great food. Enjoyed  a lot. A must visit when you r in Bali. Beach like never  seen before. Awsome water sports activities. Fun for adventure  lovers.
Andrew,Antarctica,Jul 2017,The waves are too harsh for swimmers and yet too small for seasoned surfers.  The waves are filled with black sand so it tends to stain your clothes and follow you to the hotel. Nightlife is great with a good choice of live bands
PHJTD,"Chippenham, UK",Jul 2017,"This is the first time we have been to Bali and chose the hotel on the basis that it was next to a great beach with good surf. What we hadn't experienced before, however, was a level of concern that swimmers would get into difficulty in the waves and rip that meant that swimming in anything other than ankle deep water immediately attracted a loud whistle blow from the lifeguards. Thankfully we had a pool at the hotel and the kids could go in the sea for surfing lessons but we could not enjoy beautiful waves as much as we wanted. All that said, the sunsets on this beach are amazing and the balance of nightlife, restaurants and shops is just right. Maybe if we had known a bit more about the nature of the rip on the coast we would have gone somewhere else which came better recommended for swimming but then we would have to sacrifice the vibe. "
carole h,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2017,"Love sunsets at Seminyak.Hundreds of people of all ages quietly enjoying the views over the water on this extensive beach - no hassles from traders, just peaceful enjoyment of this beautiful place. Simple pleasures. And free!"
Brijesh24,"Bhubaneswar, India",Jul 2017,You must visit this place to view sunset ! Beach is full of people who gather around 5 pm to click ..
Sulifamily,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,"Busy, beautiful and ever changing. Very good beach.If you are staying somewhere else it's a great experience to visit Seminyak beach"
Peter S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,We visited a few times mostly to enjoy the sunset while enjoying a beer.You can watch surfers and the people enjoying themselves.Parking is cheap if you need it and the local food drink people are friendly

David K,3 contributions,Jul 2017,Great night and great food. Cocktails were good and food was delicious!! Yudi our waiter was a gem and the bar service was sublime
Beth L,"Aberdeen, UK",Jul 2017,We loved the beach with the fantastic bars. The bean bags and umbrellas were really colourful and most bars had live music. Really chilled. Even the beach vendors were fun to watch and not pushy. 
wherearethedans,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,"This was a nice beach, if not a bit touristy. Worth a visit, just to stroll along the beach to see the locals selling their products. "
Ika_deShooters,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Jul 2017,Its one of famous spot for sunset. A little crowded but still good to see sunset.Have may bars on the beach with bean bed.. so u can relax and having a good time
TartanCat57,"Appin, United Kingdom",Jul 2017,Yuck---so many people and no place to sit without someone wanting to charge you. Noisy road next to beach and so much trash. Water not even that warm. Such a disappointment after the lovely beaches elsewhere in Bali. Not sure what the attraction is. 
Jonathan P,31 contributions,Jul 2017,Sunset has changed but still fun. So many bean bags and bintang offers. The beach has always been a great spot for people watching and remains that way. I lo e coming down and spending time watching all the activities
Odyssey463749,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2016,Nice beach. But I would say it's more commercial. We did find our peaceful moment but we would visit it only at sunset like we did. 
Chris A,3 contributions,Jul 2017,It was a little hectic. Very crowded and full of beach clubs pumping loud music. Beaches by Nusa Dua and Uluwatu better.
Anna T,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"Great atmosphere on the beach.  Live band,  but the sands is black oil and the water is dirty.  Couldn't walk on the sand as the feet were black and sticky.  The locals are helpful, polite and fun. "
Mich328,"Park Forest, IL",Jun 2017,"Upon arrival, you pay about .50 to enter. It is worth it. A black temple was fascinating to see. There are loungers and umbrella,too. Go early because the parking lot can become full quickly, if you are driving."
Eka Widya Ristanti,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Visit seminyak, feel free and cool. beautifull beach and the best view in Seminyak Bali Denpasar. please try"
Phil R,"Manchester, UK",Jul 2017,"Don't get me wrong, seminyak beach is stunning with its black sands, amazing sunset and massive waves. But unless you take plenty of food/drink there with you, you're gonna get stung. Unlike kuta beach, it's hard to come by a cheap little place to get a drink or food. There are sunbed spots (which are a bit of a rip off for the bed) where you can get a drink for a fair price, but the beach is mainly dominated by resorts that look like you have to have a lot of cash to stay/eat/drink there. Not only that but I've never known a beach be so hard to access. The shore line is dominated by massive resorts and beach clubs that you just can't get past from the road to the beach. We stumbled across a car park we could cut through to the beach luckily and another time we found a little alley to walk down, but failing that you'd just have to blag your way through a hotel lobby. Ridiculous. Kuta beach gets a bad rep but we had a better day there, it was easily accessible, there was cheaper drink and food everywhere and the sands sea and sunsets were just as nice."
ancyancy,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"The sunsets at Seminyak never disappoints. There's just something about this beach which also explains why all the beach bars along this stretch is always popular and crowded. The only thing that's disappointing is that in late Dec, there's an atrocious amount of rubbish and trash that is washed up onto the beach. We had to clear a tiny spot of plastic bags, wrappers, papers, so that my child can play on the sand. It's gross. This is due to the change in the current and the resorts along the beach tries their best to sweep it every day but you really can't win the ocean.But any other month that I've been there, it's just gorgeous. I'll return again and again."
Paddy J,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,It was a lovely place to go to and relax. Although the guys trying to sell the tourists watched were MOST annoying.
melanie aleman,"Quito, Ecuador",Aug 2016,"The Seminyak area is definitely my preference over Kuta. The restaurants and shops are better, and there are many cool place to hang out with on the beach. I recommend finding a spot with bean bags and hookah. I could be there forever!"
Piyush Patel,"Marrakech, Morocco",Jul 2017,Seminyak beach üåä is stunning. It's not white sands but dark volcanic sands. But the good news is no pebbles so easy to walk on without foot wear and very child friendly . The beach is very clean. Negatives not always swimmable the waves are quite high and strong. It's great for surfing and there are many restaurants including Potato Head & Ku Da Te ... 
Linda K,"Wales, UK",Jul 2017,"Seminyak is much quieter than those further down the coast such as Legian and especially Kuta. There are a number of big hotels bordering the beach but also some nice bars and restaurants. Same facilities available as the busier beaches - chairs, umbrellas, surfing, etc. There also seemed to be less beach sellers up here too.Great to wander and sit and watch the world go by in a bar before wandering back again."
Nicole J,"Buderim, Australia",Jul 2017,"Seminyak beach like that whole stretch from Kuta Legian to Seminyak is great. Get a lounge for around $5Aus for 2hrs ( negotiate ) and soak up the sun sea and all the carrying on around you. You can get a cold drink from the guy on the beach you just have to put up with the beach hawkers but if you dont want to buy or have a massage, nails done just so No. Like all the beaches its not the whitest sand but its great. Relax and enjoy."
LDW777,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2017,"We had dinner at La Plancha a great little restaurant by the beach close to the colourful umbrellas, kites and beanbags. Great food and excellent service. Ours was a large group and they accommodated us efficiently."
bobbylou2017,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"we stayed at the katamama hotel, watch sunset from this beach everyday. the most gorgeous sunset in kuta"
Kydroon,"Munich, Germany",Jul 2017,"a wonderful long beach with nice waves, however, the east side of Bali has the wind from the right direction."
vivek662014,"Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India",Jul 2017,I was there with my friends it a nice and fairly clean beach the best part is there is walking lane on the side and many beach shacks for all kind of food and drinks 
Soo Roh,"Cold Lake, Canada",Apr 2017,This beach is peaceful yet lively one surrounded by many resorts and beach bars. We were mostly at the side where Hotel Alila Seminyak was and there were lots of people walking by the beach and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Would love to be back!!

IrelandFailte,Ireland,Jul 2017,Amazing beach. Level flat sea very dangerous due to heavy currents mini spots to swim and surf. High waves. Behind beach there is a big dump well back from beach but needs cleaning. Water quality is very good.
SatishBalakrishnan,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,"Lovely beach with a great sunset view. The tide was decent when we went there. Enjoyed a lot. Just go there around 4 PM And stay till the sun sets, afternoon can be a bit hot."
Jessica C,"Riverwood, Australia",Jul 2017,During my stay in Bali I visited the beach as a scenic experience. Whilst walking the beach I had seen many syringes and litter. I could only imagine what would be in the water if that was on the sand
NWMale12345,"Manchester, UK",Jul 2017,"Bali is a lovely country with friendly people. Seminyak is a lively, trendy place that caters well for all ages and tastes. However, beware on the beach especially that can be full of dog excrement that dog walkers leave and do not pick up. We watched many just leave it, or even cover it with sand. Then, some unsuspecting walker stands in it with bare feet. Not good. As a seasoned, worldwide traveller this is the worst place I have seen with regards animal faeces. The pavements in the town can also be full of the same. It's a shame as it it's the only downside of a great place."
Jacoztraveller,35 contributions,Jul 2017,"This beach is not great, especially down the end with all the beach clubs. Head to Legian or Uluwatu if you want to swim in the ocean. Nice to watch the sunset though and plenty of beach bars to sit and drink. "
Althea M,"Crows Nest, Australia",Jun 2017,"Great sunsets from seminyak beach, with alot of cool bars/ restaurants to enjoy a cocktail and take it all in, my favourite being Ku Te Da. As far as beaches go in Bali i think there is better as this is typically where most people flock to, making it the one of the more run down beaches too."
Adventures_with_Kel,"Belmont, Australia",Jul 2017,We were down the expensive resort end of seminyak so quiet down there. People were flying the big kites 
afdal f,"Depok, Indonesia",Jul 2017,Many cafe/restaurant with sand floor along the beach with many choice off local/Italian/western.Clean beach best place to enjoying sunset or surfing..
Ellen M,29 contributions,Jul 2017,went down to watch the sunset many times - beautiful.saw the lanterns being let off & went to find them but couldnt - would have loved tolet one off.
Anne C,5 contributions,Jul 2017,"Not a beach I would recommend.  There is a terrible smell of phosphate and sewerage, and we decided not to swim in  it for 2 reasons, one the dirty water and two the waves were huge and lots of current.   The waves were envigorating to watch rolling in to the shore. I guess that is a positive. A host of restaurants are scattered  along the beach. Beach loungers available to hire.Most resorts had do not swim signs up, due to currents  and had security staff looking out for those who ignored the signs.  Make sure you choose accommodation that offers a pool."
jmason2017,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2017,"Wonderful Sandy beach, good waves and a tremendous selection of beah restaurents for lunch and sunset. Many happy days spent here."
sunantawu,"Shanghai, China",Jun 2017,A long straight beach with foot-friendly sand.Good for relaxing and for kids to play at.Quite easy to find place to dine in. And also important is access to the airport can avoid  the always congested Kuta and Legian area.
richbb2014,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,Oh what a Rooftop Bar but even better was the Plantation Restaurant one floor below. Fantastic steak and Bomb Alaska and entertainment. Best in Bali.
HorsemanNomad,"Idaho Falls, ID",Jul 2017,We spent several days here and liked this beach way more than Jimbaran Bay.  It is cleaner and has nicer sand and waves.

Jean H,"Limerick, Ireland",Jul 2017,"The whole beach had a dirty feel, especially around the many 'rivers' that flow down to the ocean and smell very strong. The beach clubs were nice with beanbags and music but honestly I couldn't wait to get away from the area.Will be staying at my hotel pool tomorrow."
joysybabe,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, UK",Jul 2017,"Thought the beach was dirty with rubbish and broken glass, and I was dismayed at the number of dogs running freely on beach at all times of day. Not a patch as gorgeous as I expected. "

Brent S,"Chandler, AZ",Jul 2017,The kids enjoyed this beach. No pushy sales people.  Surf lessons available.  Bar and restaurant choices along the beach and within walking distance. 
Cherrykidz,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"great place to hang, drink while catching sunset or just simply enjoy your sunset while walking on the beach."
Greg Massacra,"Galway, Ireland",Jul 2017,"It is nice beach for first visit when you arrive on Bali, but there is a lot of coral pieces in sand so Its hard to walk on beach without flip flops on. Apart from that its lovely as all Bali. They are serving drinks, beach boys are not too annoying like for example in Kenya. "
DaniLL,"Lydney, UK",Jul 2017,"My husband & I watched the sun go down from Seminyak beach this evening, my gosh it was outstanding. It's very busy, in the car park outside you can purchase authentic Balinese street food. On the beach, there are couples, families, groups of friends, dogs, you name it.It really is a place for all.The waves are spectacular & great for surfers & spectators alike. Definately worth a visit! "
Esmaeil F,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2017,watching the surfersEating your corn on the beachHaving a drink in one of the bars thereFeel the waves
FrankandTonia,"Ashburton, New Zealand",Jul 2017,There's something about Bali Beaches that makes them a bit special: The people.Yes there are a few hawkers but they are not pushy and add to the charmThe sand and surf are good but you should check the safe areas for swimming 
Rollin Adventures,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is very Overated. There are much better beaches in Bali. Coming from the Sunshine Coat in Australia, we don't frequent Bali for the beach. Mainly suited for those who ""have to be seen"" in Seminyak. Lots of eateries and shopping in the area."
Paul W,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,Very surprised at how clean this beach was. Excellent surf beach with plenty of places to hire boards etc. Peaceful and not harassed. Kids had a great time.
westluxnick,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Visited many times 66 beach rooftop,Cocoon,two or three restaurants on the beach,all good venues,sunset there a must."
Paul C,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,A good semi-surf type of beach with not a lot of vendors on it. The hotel restaurants are close by with easy access.
Robyn,27 contributions,Dec 2016,"This was the first beach I went to in Bali and I expected a lot more from it. We did go in December, but I found that it was very dirty and didn't really like being there. We walked up and down, then went and found something else to do"
nsl115,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2017,A very long stretch of beach with blackish sand and turbulent waters with strong waves. Lovely to watch the waves come into the beach and fun to be in the water and have the waves crash over you but do look out for the strong currents.The sunset is quite spectacular so well worth catching this.We couldn't find any good public baths or toilets which is an area the tourist promotion board should look into. However there are restaurants and cafes along the beach that you could use but no shower facilities or changing rooms that we could find.
Melanieh910,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2017,"Unfortunately the day that I first visited was after a big down pour, the rubbish was phenomenal and sad."

sfarisah,"Hua Hin, Thailand",Jul 2017,"This beach are much better than kuta beach..more calm, clean and not congested.However, to get there you need to walk a bit or take taxi/ motocycle...i entered the beach area via kudeta enterance..Worth for evening walk"
jrpt93,"Brentwood, UK",Jul 2017,"The beach has lovely sand, however it is not good for swimming. It's more of a surfing beach, the waves are very large sometimes. I preferred Legian beach although Seminyak beach seemed to be clearer to see the sunset. (Might have been weather related) "
Sam V,"Schilde, Belgium",Jun 2017,"If you like surfing, go there. Big waves!If you like snorkeling, don't. You'll only see sand. Beach is all but sand, comfortable when you go into sea. "
Jo B,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,"Whether you want to walk along the beach, go surfing, sit and have a drink or eat a meal, you will find what you want on Seminyak beach. The foreshore is lined with little eateries and bars overlooking the ocean. During the day there are sun lounges and umbrellas. At night there are beanbags and coloured lights out on the sand where you can dine or enjoy a quiet drink. Some places have live music that can be heard from the surrounding venues. You will also be visited by a range of locals trying to sell you anything from sarongs to toys or watches. Just say no thanks if you're not interested. "
Carol P,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"I have been to Bali many times but never to Seminyak. We walked down to the beach down a very busy road and near the entrance to the beach it was extremely busy and you have to watch for scooters and vehicles, it seems the private drivers park along the street and therefore makes it hard to walk along pavements. The beach was very long and there are lots of bars with bean bags and tables to sit and watch the breathtaking show of the sunset. It was a good place to watch the people walking by and others trying to get the best photo. I found the sand to be a grey colour which made your feet look dirty and very difficult to brush off. There are a lot of local people selling their goods which can get annoying. I was not overwhelmed by this beach and on our way back to the road via the path which runs behind the bars a enormous rat ran across our path. I think in future I'll watch the sunset from some place else."
Tejaldaftary,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2017,"If you are a surfer, you have to go to Bali and visit the beaches - one of them being Seminyak. The waves are good for beginners as well as people who surf regularly. "
Jacques du Toit,"Pretoria, South Africa",Apr 2017,"Great spot to surf in the mornings and a very relaxed atmosphere. Always barter for surfboards and sun loungers. By the time we got the hang of it, we consistently paid IR100k for a lounger and surfboard for the ENTIRE day. In the beginning we paid that for an hour, etc. So just keep walking if they don't agree - you'll get your price. But do it respectfully."
cheyennewyn,"Balakong, Malaysia",Apr 2017,One of my favourite spots to watch the sunset in Bali. It's always busy but I still love it! Love the vibe there!
Nicholas,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,Seminyak Beach is a great place to have a drink and watch the sunset. Also good place to go with family and friends.
Pamela R,18 contributions,Jun 2017,This beach is very good for a quick dip but predominately for surfers. That in itself is good because there is always something to see while your there. There are an abundance of bars on the beach and they all seem good. Street food is available if your game or you can bring your own. The downside is that there a lot of beach vendors who will approach you. Buts thats everywhere in bali. Overall we had a great time there on many occasions.
SangiTani,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2017,"This beach was clean with beautiful sunset views. Me and my daughter spent almost 3 hours at beach, U can relax near the shore there are paid benches available.  Book your chair and watch the sunset. Great place to catch some waves when the surfs up. There are local vendors for coconut water, beer, corn etc. my daughter went for local braids done by local Indonesian personal. It was overall enjoyable place."
sonalshomakash,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is a public beach & has everything to offer for every age. It has many open air restaurants on beach to drink & dine with LIVE music & enjoy the ambience. Across the road you have plenty more open air restaurants. Water is cleaner than Kuta beach. Best part is you can walk from seminyak beach to kuta beach, it is that long....However, this beach is for surfing only, not recommended for swimming. I personally liked this beach more than Kuta beach."
Firly I,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"If you want to see the sunset then this is a great place for you,  but i reckon the beach is so busy and a bit dirty its kinda hard to walk slowly and enjoying the view. "
Vivi G,"County Dublin, Ireland",Jun 2017,"We were in Seminyak on our honeymoon and we really loved the beach. The water is nice sandy and clean and we were like kids enjoying the crazy, strong waves with other people, it was lots of fun. On the other side you won't get much privacy to enjoy the sunset from the sellers.. They are constantly there and standing front of you cover the view.. not so romantic.."
stargazer62,"Coventry, UK",Jun 2017,Quite gritty sand more for surfers I think. Went at sundown but it was quite cloudy. Our children (20 & 25 ) went three times & loved it. 
GillHNewcastle,"Tynemouth, UK",Jun 2017,"The beach is long and wide but was pretty dirty at the seminyak part - it seemed cleaner the further towards kuta you went which was surprising. There were loads of bathroom waste items like toothpaste tubes and nappies and even a hypodermic needle on one part. Lots of hawkers too - the closer to kuta the more persistent they were. We headed off to jimbaran, padang padang and other quieter more pleasant spots for a day on the beach."
Daniel H,"Mernda, Australia",Jun 2017,"Wow what a beautiful beach i recomend it to couples from Australia to experience the Seminyak Beach.Especially on the sunset,just the crowd of locals and tourists is mind boggling and sitting there having a mocktail or bintang is the true Bali experience.All the beach markets and locals trying there best to make ends meet in selling there cultural gifts,be there at least an hour before sunset to get your lounge chair and mocktail."
Mark H,"Enmore, Australia",Jun 2017,"This was my third & last visit as this sad beach has not got cleaner. Only go if you want the experience of swimming with plastic & faeces. Miles & miles of bottles & trash. The locals ignore the waste blaming it on tides bringing pollution from Java or the rain washing trash down from the mountains. Whatever the cause, they do nothing about it.BTW the stray dogs that live on the beach are treated cruelly. Another reason not to go."
Andre H,8 contributions,Jun 2017,"Upside: lovely beach with loads of loungers & umbrellas for rent. Many delightful restaurants with wide variety of cuisine at reasonable prices. Downside: The beach can do with some business community participation to clean up plastic and other rubbish. The hawkers (although respected for their role) are mostly over-pushy and bordering annoying. Three times saying ""no thank you"" with a smile, should be enough. It is unpleasant elevating your blood pressure over something as stupid as this while supposed to relax.  "
Satish Chander,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2016,If your looking for a place to spent quality time the this is the place for you. Make sure you enter the beach from Potato Head beach club. You can spent hours sitting here with you partner looking at the sunset. Don't forget to bring umbrella if you don't like the rain.
AliciaVC,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2017,"Seminyak is a black sand beach with huge waves, making it great for surfing or bodyboarding. Gets lovely sunsets with being on the west coast. There are some cool beach bars scattered along the beach, giving it a similar vibe to a Thai island. Busy and touristy, but much cleaner than other beaches in Bali!"
Darnel-HDI,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,Located next to Kuta Beach. Seminyak is crowded with do many viditor. Tje beach just average. Not so clean.
Mansi S,23 contributions,Jun 2017,Nice for sunset but can get crowded if you don't stay in the resorts but just visit the beach. The area in front of resorts is clean and not that crowded so if visiting try finding a quiet spot and enjoy the sunset
chanda01,"Bengaluru, India",Jun 2017,"The beach looks just perfect. Best to fly a kite or just sit on a bean bag at one of the many beach clubs around, sip a drink and look at the beautiful sunset. Many hawkers here though."
Bryan2211,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is cleaner than most other beaches, and nice surf. Not overcrowded and the surf was also nice. It's got a beautiful sunset - when it's not too cloudy. Worth a visit when you are in Bali."
Deb M,"Kalaru, Australia",Jun 2017,We went down to Seminyak Beach to spend the day and swim - it was such a shame the beach was so littered with rubbish and the local sellers just did not leave you alone!!
Shane S,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,Lovely. Seminyak is very friendly and plenty to see eat and do..double six beach is a must. I recommend Annora villas for a magical time in Bali....
BeautifulBernard,Singapore,Jun 2017,"We spent an amazing couple of days enjoying Kuta Beach, Seminyak. The sand isn't powder white because of the volcanic sand and it could do with a beach clean but the waves totally make up for it. Our young daughters really enjoyed jumping in, over and ""surfing"" the waves back to shore.The beach sellers also have everything you could want from Sarongs to beer and arwn't too pushy."
Kevin,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2017,"Seminyak has a lovely beach, a lot nicer than the beach in Kuta in my opinion. Sunbeds are cheaper here too. Loads of cool bars along the beach front too :)"
Vanitha,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2017,Black sand beach with high current. Super place for surfing! During High tides you will see lots of surfers. Sand is black as volcanic sand. Seminyak square and a nice night life makes this a good choice to spend your day here ! 
Judith S,"New South Wales, Australia",Jun 2017,"Have been to Bali a few times but never stayed at Seminyak so thought it would be a good idea this time around. Seminyak is certainly more lay back than it's two rivals (Legian and Kuta) but unfortunately, like the rest of Bali, the most obvious thing is the RUBBISH all over this beach. There appears to be minimal respect for what people dispose of and what's washed up on the shore. I did notice a front loader attempting to clear some of the rubbish at high tide AM, which doesn't appear at low tide when the rubbish is more evident. Once again, it's all about the money rather than the paradise that people flock here for, and with more and more tourists hitting this little island, if something isn't done this will only get worse. This will be my last time visiting this island as I find it very distressing to see the abuse of animals, nature and little respect for the Eco system that this island has to offer."
Ruchi890,"Moradabad, India",Apr 2017,"If you are looking for peace and tranquility, this is the place to be . Nice , calm , refreshing and relaxing , seminayak is the refined form of kuta which is noisy and crowded . Stay in seminayak if all you want is quite and calm . A completely different form of Bali and it's culture.lovely place to be . Just go for a stroll on the beach even if you are staying in kuta . "
almago6,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"The beach at Seminyak is over crowded and dirty, lots of rubbish washing up. The redeeming fact is if you're staying on the beach it's great to watch the sun go down"
RonnieYang,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Touts throng the beach at Kuta and at Tanjong Benoa, but not at Seminyak. Its a lot more peaceful. The beach is so clean that it is safe to jog barefoot!The sunsets are also amazing. The beach side establishments: Ku De Ta and Potato Head also lend to the laid back, yet happening atmosphere to the beach.This beach is way better than the one at Kuta. Definitely worth a visit."
Jem Coco food and travel adventures,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017," One of my favourite things to do is go to the beach so I have visited many beaches in different countries. I was shocked to see a beach like this in Asia. Now I know for a fact that it is true with what people say, Bali is known more for their resorts and not their beaches."
mimi_mechosem,gurgaon,May 2017,"Seminyak is Bali's most fashionable beach, home to among the island's luxurious resorts and host to a number of fine restaurants and boutiques. Fashion stores and top dining spots.Seminyak's Petitenget Beach offers a more secluded ambiance compared to its sister strands of Kuta and Legian to the south.Evening scene more nice."
tonyv6,"Newport, UK",Jun 2017,"Beautiful clean beach,plenty of small bars with bean bags and sunloungers,barter on the price for sunloungers typically they say 150000rp got them down to 100000rp which when converted to english pounds is about ¬£6.50 which is really cheap.Definitely recommend seminyak beach."
gavs23,"Canberra, Australia",Jun 2017,"What a let down. Terrible surf. Dirty, greyish sand and rubbish everywhere. I don't know if it's the locals or the tourists...probably both...but why do people treat the planet as a giant garbage dump?"
bootsy1989,28 contributions,Jun 2017,"We loved this beach ! However expect to be asked every 2 minutes literally to buy things ... if your girlfriend loves to sun bathe and you get a bit bored though this is a good way to keep busy so i really didn't mind we caught some rays and listened to some nice music ... on our own speaker that is , the beds were really comfy and we didn't get hasseled by the people's beds we used they were really nice :) we'll be back "
Isuru palliyaguru,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2017,Place like no other :) it was great 6 days we were spending in seminyak bali.. Allways great food and drinks and fantastic service almost each and every restaurant we went .. highly recommended  holiday destination .cheers 
Sudhan R,20 contributions,Jun 2017,Good and beautiful... Not so deep.. It's shallow for some distance.. Its not a blue one.. Can enjoy a beautiful sunset
geromam,"Geraldton, Australia",Jun 2017,We decided to walk from Seminyak beach to Kuta Beach. Average speed. Took a couple of hours as we had to take refuge under beach umbrellas from the rain. Credit to people cleaning up as hardly any litter on the sand. Water looked clean but not sure with water from the roads flowing straight into the ocean. Not too many dogs running around the morning we went. Maybe the rain put them off?
Jarkko L,"Espoo, Finland",Jun 2017,"Great place for surfing, usually big waves especially in the Legian direction (where most of the surf schools are). Often red flags for swimming due to waves. Great fine sandy beach for sunbathing. Lots of beach bars/restaurants."
Shivi G,"Toronto, Ontario",Aug 2016,"This beach has the most amazing views and just so many neat places to eat and activities to do. Not as clear as the Pandava beach, but definitely beautiful! "
Syme0n,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,"If there's even such a word. Bali is home to a multitude of scenic sunset views and Seminyak isn't shy of holding quite a few records of stunning photographic opportunities. Take a stroll after breakfast or just before dinner when the sun is about to set and I can guarantee you that your life's perspective would change. Clean sandy white beaches, azure blue skies and the deep vast ocean blue are just a couple of things that would rope beach-goers and water sports enthusiasts."
Henry S,Jakarta,Jun 2017,"The beach is nice and so huge area, it means the long beach there..There is a beautiful sunset there and good for family activity...There are couples bar and lounge to enjoy during sun down..The beach also clean, with the beautiful white sands"
Kristine Li ‚Ä¢ The Petite Wanderess,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Went to this particular stretch of the beach and I actually find Seminyak beach much better than Kuta's beach which I had visited years ago. Seminyak beach wasn't as dirty as I imagined from the reviews, I didn't really see rubbish in the sea or dead fishes washed ashore (as seen at Kuta)?!? Waves were huge in the evening so it's definitely not for swimming, but the sunset was beautiful! There were no hawkers trying to sell us stuff too, as compared to Kuta's constant stream of persistent hawkers."
dananghagni,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Some said that the beach is filthy, but i think the Seminyak is still can be consider as clean, both that there were not any garbage and trash, and also there were not many locals trying to sell you things unlike in Kuta.good and wide space, the beach is perfect for waiting sunset, and just sitting around enjoying oneself or letting your kid plays with the sands.the wave is quite big in the middle, not suitable for swimming, specially for kids, but it will be a perfect spot for surfing."
Robin T,"Glasgow, UK",Jan 2017,My wife and I selected and booked a luxury hotel on the beach as we enjoyed a beach holiday and swimming in the sea. We were most disappointed with the filth along the whole of Seminyak beach and in the sea. On enquiry we were told that the waste were wash ashore from another part of Indonesia. If you want a beach holiday in Bali this is not a place to go. Will not return and will not recommend tourist to go 
Helena,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2017,"Big waves, kind of crowded and lots of people wanting to sell you stuff. I'm not a surfer so I found it hard to appreciate the beach although I understand that surfers do. Wouldn't recommend it if you're not used to swimming with big waves and it's suitable for children."
drwols,"Gloucester, UK",Jun 2017,"Similar to Petitenget beach, just a little busier. Sea is too rough to swim in, but great for surfing. If you've visited other beaches in South East Asia, this isn't worth making a special effort to visit "
JoJo,California,Jun 2017,"This beach was nice for drinks at night but as far as the water goes it was a bit rough. The waves were small but the undertow was mighty. Also, if you think you are far enough back you are not. Take a look around and see where the chairs are placed and know that the water will come up to and sometimes past them. At night we saw a couple of rows of beanbag chairs and tables being taken into the ocean. It was funny until you realized that the customers not only lost their drinks but possibly their cell phones too. "
Sarah2424111,"Horsham, UK",Jun 2017,A few bars and some market stalls clean beach would go again. Not many 'sellers'  hassling you to buy their wares unlike at kuta beach 
dipalihanda,5 contributions,Jun 2017,Nice beach. It was calm and clean and not so crowded. Very beautiful sunset there . We enjoyed there. Some one was flying kite and another was playing with the dog.
DexterD2013,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jun 2017,"The beach shelves away quite steeply here and results in 'dumpy' waves that wouldn't be great for small children and isn't that conducive to swimming.A nice beach to go for a walk on although there are lots of beach umbrellas and loungers set out during the day, so you are best to go early in the morning when it also a bit cooler."
Maria H,8 contributions,Jun 2017,Walking distance from our villa....Sand a little rough and dark....Plenty of chairs at beach to hire for the day.Great surf...lovely warm water.All you need there..
Leicaman8,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,Great beach to watch the spectacular sunsets especially from cool beach clubs like ku de ta and potato head. These beach clubs are more pricy but they are recommended top end clubs . There are numerous cheap eating places and massages done on the beach . Good beach for morning or evening walks to people watch . 
sandrajago,"Anglesea, Australia",Jun 2017,"went specifically for  the surf, and is for experienced surfers only. My son who has surfed all over the world found it quite dangerous. The beach was closed for surfing on a few days and would recommend early mornings as being the best time to go.   "
Xena,17 contributions,Jun 2017,"My friend and I got a sun-bed for 200k Indonesian Rupees for the whole day - that's 100k each, we tried other beaches around the area and the prices asked were about the same; you can, if you're up to, bargain the prices a little bit though. The guy, who lent us the sunbeds took great care of our things too - the one time our shoes were washed away by a wave, so he secure them for us, etc. The beach is amazing to have a sundowner drink, the bars/restaurants will let you then sit on a beanbag at the beach with some fancy small umbrellas - super cute. "
Abi B,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is really nice In my option, not quite the tranquil paradise like beach you think of when visiting Bali but this place has a really good surf beach which is clean and fun. The best part of Seminyak beach is at night, it really does come to life. Everyone gathers to watch the sun set drinking beers on all the bean bags they put out, really great atmosphere and amazing sun set!"
SaketPandit,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,Seminyak Beach is lovely in many ways. There aren't too many hawkers bothering you but at the same time there's plenty of shacks to get a drink or some fresh coconut water. Definitely recommended!
AnnMarieGrace,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,My husband and I took our 1 and 2 year old to the beach in morning and we had a spectacular time. I don't think it is one of the prettiest beaches I have been to though we still had fun.We brought sand toys from one of the market stores which we used to dig and build castles and in the water along the shore we jumped the waves while watching the surfers. It was early (830-1030am) in the morning that we didn't get hassled by any sales people.I have been to Seminyak beach in the evening with the kids for dinner and drinks as well. We did get a lot of people coming up us trying to sell us things. My husband had enough whereas I didn't mind it was window browsing for me while I sat and enjoyed my cocktail. They were great as they didn't bother the kids who again played with the beach toys.
Sathesh K,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"It's a very nice place to visit. The sand is very fine, it feels very comfortable to walk on. The water that touches the shore is very clear. The whole beach is a great place to play, walk in. "
Paula B,"Leeds, UK",Jun 2017,Not as great as TripAdvisor would suggest sadly. The bars around are pretty cool but the amount of rubbish spoils the experience.
Adrie L,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,"Went there for lunch and dinner for separate occasions. May not be the nicest beach in Bali but there are nice and inexpensive places to eat, rest and relax in the heat. "
Martha Elena T,13 contributions,Jun 2017,"Its filthy literally see diapers along the beach., sales people pushing to sale stuff, trust me you dont want to take home a horrible image of Bali"
ErinOz,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,When you live in Australia the beaches of Bali don't really compare to what we have at home. Seminyak's great for beach bars to watch the sunset but it's not the crystal clear water haven that can be found on many neighbouring islands. 
Laurie S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"Visited twice, both times before dusk. Bit cloudy on the horizon so the sunset was not really beautiful although once was pretty good. But the beach itself is great - wide, flattish & genuinely one of the great beaches of my life especially in the late afternoon. Maybe not spotlessly clean but better than those in my Melbourne experience. Romantic & exotic as well as great weather always - quite vibrant too with so many things happening on the beach."
ukrania,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun 2017,"If you're looking for fairytale white sand and see through glass water, not the place..if you are looking for chilled out party vibe,ok swimming, easy surfing it's great..good place to hang out soak up some sun and good vibes...think way toned down, cleaner, Kuta..you can rent a board for 50k, there are low pressure beach peddlers that are accepting to a polite no thank you, you can get 2 beds/umbrella/table for 50k an hour, bean bag bars at sunset are great...check it out"
Fruzsina S,22 contributions,Jun 2017,"Nice and less crowded than Kuta Beach, we were there several times. Also next to the beach there is a street with full of nice hotel resorts, we we usually had dinner. The sunset is awesome :) "
Happyfacea,"Hervey Bay, Australia",Jun 2017,Beach was quite dirty and smelly. I would not swim there or even walk on the sand. Good markets there
Peteski2016,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Apr 2017,"This is a nice beach for sundowners and surfers - not a swimming beach as a result of the surfers although you could have a quick dip at sunset when the surfers stop - nice sand and a great walk - lots to see and do - pictures and there are the beach vendors but they are very nice.............lots of clubs and restaurants along the beach W, Potatohead etc. La Laguna Restaurant and small independents - you will find something you love here............"
Preetikh,24 contributions,Jun 2017,"Stunning sunset, wonderful ambience as you sit on bean bags provided by the beach shacks, relax have a drink, surf swim!!"
Carmencita222,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2017,"My boyfriend and I much prefer this beach over the many others we have been to thus far. In the evening the whole vibe on the beach is wonderful... lots of live music, hooka, beanbag chairs and lanterns you can light to the sky if you choose. "
surfsteve7,"Coolum Beach, Australia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak Beach is THE  place to go for a  "" sundowner ""  . This is Aussie slang for a great place to be to watch the sunset and be a part of the day turning to night . For many this is a significant part of the day . With a great choice of Bars  Restos  and other attractions you are spoiled by the array of eating drink and just plain hanging out options .   Be careful if you have children as all beaches are a risk ."
LorinE-lovestotravel,"Sunbury, Australia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is very picturesque.  Long expanse of white sand, dotted with beach clubs, restaurants and hawkers selling their wares.  You can sit in bean bag chairs with a Bintang and watch the sunset.  There was one man selling black Pirate Ship kites that looked amazing floating over the ocean.  The waves are very strong, I just walked into the water a little way and the pull from the waves nearly had me off my feet.  The water is a great temperature."
Salina A,38 contributions,Jun 2017,The views of the beach are stunning day or night. Unfortunately there is rubbish along the beach and some has washed up. Such a shame that people using the beach aren't better disposing of rubbish. The beach can be crowded in parts but the upside is you can book activities easily or buy a drink. There are bars and hotels along the beach too. It is a must see spot. Enjoy! 
jedoanuta j,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak Beach has great sunsets. The water is very polluted, the beach is mostly very very dirty. Be careful if you have kids, strong rips and the water is filthy"
LarsLyngse,"Copenhagen, Denmark",May 2017,"Beautiful beach with white sand but heavy waves - recommendable for surfers, but not for children and families. "
Natasha B,5 contributions,Jun 2017,My children are quite young and the beach wasn't really suitable for swimming but they still loved the walks..... 
Kirsty S,"St. Albans, UK",Aug 2016,"Stayed here for our wedding, took our vows  overlooking the sea and couldn't have asked for better scenery.The sea is rough but I happily swam. Great for people watching. Lots of happy memories."
Mary M,"Pacific Pines, Australia",May 2017,Hired a driver to show us around for the day and landed here ...the beach was ok but the hawkers hit you as soon as you try to get comfortable ....massage hair nails the works ....nice to just relax
Elizabeth P,"Margate, UK",Jun 2017,"The beach is beautiful and the waves high but I tried swimming and it wasn't pleasant. The sunloungers are about 150k for 2 all day which is a lot. The people selling things are a  bit much but you have ro pretend to sleep! They are nice people but persistent and they are friendly. Bali is quiet right now due to a  terrorist attack in Jakarta and the people are feeling it so it's difficult to be annoyed. The sea was also brown in places, it looked like cooking oil. There are lots of stray dogs all over Bali including the beach which is heartbreaking."
Syawalianto,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2017,"The beach is less crowded compare to Kuta. The waves are decent for beginner to start learning how to surf. Many vendors for board rentals, and the boards are much better shape compare to those in Kuta. I paid 50k IDR for 1 hour of long board soft top rental. But negotiated for lower rate when I rent more than 1 board or took it longer than 1 hour. Lot's of cafes too on the beach ground so you can relax and enjoy watching sunset afterwards. No public shower place, if I am not mistaken (Kuta has them).Lately people are complaining about the thrash in Bali beaches. When I ask a local, he said that there is periodical clean-ups of these beaches. So just before this you might encounter a very dirty beach. But I guess most of the time they are allright."
vs-gurgaon,gurgaon,May 2017,"although a public beach.. But it was nice and clean.. NO water sports or acclivities can be done.. Just go for enjoying the sea, waves and maybe a stroll on the beach"
Filipa A,7 contributions,Jun 2017,"Bad beach, very dirty and impossible to bath. The sand is dark and filled with garbage.There are sewers that enter directly at the beach and provide a terrible smell "
Mehdi T,"Casablanca, Morocco",Jun 2017,"Interesting beach, quiter than Kuta but still busy at sunset. You can get a bed for 50krp, and get fresh drinks. Depending on where you stay, it's pretty accessible. Also the sand isn't volcanic like other beaches in Bali. "
Marnauli T,3 contributions,May 2017,"the beach is more clean and less people that kuta beach.in the afternoon, the cafe will put many beanBags in the beach so you can sit and enjoy the sunset"
rob1528,"Widnes, UK",Jun 2017,Lovely beach with a great sunset and live acoustic music at the bars at night bean bags on the beach this is the place to chill out at night 
deepforezt,"London, UK",May 2017,"I don't normally like to give bad reviews. But here you have to. Long beach with lot of restaurants and other outlets. But people will pester you to buy their products. At some point you will get irritated. Now coming back to the beach, it is dirty and lot of waste here and there lying around. Not clean at all. Rubbish all through the sand. . This beach is for new comers. Those who hasn‚Äôt experienced what a real good beach or sea side will call it great as I have seen some of the reviewers do. But if you have gone to Mauritius, Seychelles or some islands in Thailand then you will know what clean beaches do look like. Have been to many beaches around the world. But really disappointed with the way they kept the bay. Same with Kutta beach as well. Sunset is the only good thing you can say about this beach. There are lot of hotels on the line of beach side which has pool. Try to get a room there and sit and relax in the pool side as they are much better."
Steve_Mathieson,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2017,"I love the atmosphere of Seminyak, not so busy as Kuta but with plenty of scope for all things esecially the beachside eateries"
HEtraveler,"Carmel, IN",May 2017,This is a nice beach for walking on the sand. It's relatively flat with high waves that moves back-and-forth. Not that suitable for swimming. Probably good for surfing. Sunset view is spectacular. I enjoyed it.
Rasha S,"Amman, Jordan",Jun 2017,Can rent sun beds easily alwaus ask for half price they accept. Coconut water is a must u can take ur own drinks easily. Massage ladies can be annoying but try to be nice they will go away :)for buying anything ask for hapf price alwaaaaays
Carlee Wilson,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"Love this beautiful beach. So much to enjoy. Many places to enjoy a cold drink, great good and enjoy the sunset and swimming. "
Chris C,"Noosa, Australia",May 2017,"Polluted streams spoil this beach esp just south of Ku De Ta. Streams help the surf but even so there was little shape and strong currents sometimes just sideways, other times sideways and taking you way out to sea. Definitely not a place for a real swim unless unusually calm. Not too crowded"
sumirejay,"London, UK",Jul 2016,This beach is popular with a lot of the young people saying nearby in hotels but it avoids the overcrowded feeling in many European beaches as it is wide and well catered by staffs of the on beach hotels. The surface isnt too rough and the water is warm. Charming to walk here in the evening or go for a shisha 
biljanalab,"Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia",Apr 2017,it is nice beach with a lot of bars where you can spend you time. most of people are tourists. have great sunset.
tastraveller20152015,"Hobart, Australia",May 2017,Very crowded beach with it difficult to find a place to sit without having to pay for the privilege.
Ross&JessL,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"We stayed 10 nights this year , we stayed last year as well, still a nice hotel close to everything pool great , beach across the road with bands at night  , the rooms cleaned everyday , staff friendly and accommodating , breakfast was ok , They had a wedding group aussies at the hotel at the same time , they were wild but harmless at the pool , luckily they only partied at the pool one day , this is not a complaint just what we experienced , the pool staff controlled the situation ,all in all still a great hotel, thanks again puri saron Great place to relax and unwind "
Linda H,"Port Augusta, Australia",May 2017,"The beach is generally clean and there is room for everyone. There are sun lounges and umbrella, bean bags and kites flying overhead. You can even have a surf lesson. There are some hawkers, but they go away if unwanted.  Great sunsets."
Omokoroa23,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2017,Open sewers running into water. Rubbish and not the best quality sand. Dirty I'd say. The water and waves were excellent when we were there. 
Jeffrey B,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"Just relaxing having a drink by the beach they have Umbrella deck chairs and seats, surf lessons if that's what interests you.You can have breakfast overlooking the water I walked from my Villa various market stalls along the way "
SantosPaul,"Toronto, Canada",Jun 2017,I found this to be a bit overrated...great if you are coming from Australia...close by. Coming from far...other options for sure.I did like Legion beach...again...not the tropical paradise one might be thinking of finding. Good place to chill and go clubbing.
Lourose73,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"A really lovely beach, but be warned you get absolutely hassled by beach vendors trying to sell you anything and everything."
Meredith H,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2017,"To me this beach is just as busy and has just as much sales people on it as Kuta and Legian. My boys that surf said the wave break was better.  However to sit on the beach and watch the sunset it is nice but again to me, no better than the other beaches.  Probably a bit nicer places to sit, lots more bean bags rather than plastic chairs."
Gloria B,"Hanoi, Ha Noi, Vietnam",May 2017,We visited the beach at sunset. The beach was very crowded. However the disturbing thing is the bad smell from the sewage system which runs directly to the sea. I think local gov must do something about this to keep the beach clean and safe
IanTwee,"Durban, South Africa",May 2017,We expected more from what was posted as an attractive beach.The surf was high but on our visits unridable.A trip to Double 6 was definitely a better bet
gaynorjohn2003,"Leyland, UK",May 2017,Quite disappointed Litter is a problem from offerings on the beachVery strong currents so not recommended for swimming unless a very confident swimmerWe attempted to find a nicer beach with a more tropical image
GeoffO,"Maroochydore, Australia",May 2017,"Much nicer beach than on the eastern side of the island at Sanur but water is sometimes very rough with signs out prohibiting swimming. Plenty of board riders though and although the tide comes in and out a fair distance, the sand is a little dark, but walking to Kuta or Potato Head is easy with plenty of lounges available all along the beach.The sunsets are amazing and of course the area is famous for them."
antinmk,"Milton Keynes, UK",May 2017,"Very clean beach, everyday (10 days) the sea was rough but plenty of people surfing. The one down side is the ""looky looky sellers"" keep asking you if you would like to buy there products, which range from a cheap bracelet to Bow & arrow! "
LeeWilkesisHere,"Ampthill, UK",May 2017,"The sunset is amazing. But yet each can be quite dirty in places.Tends to be better outside of the private beach clubs.If you can get a hotel or villas to allow you onto their private part of the beach, this is your best bet if you want to spend a whole day there.During the wet season, the currents bring lots of rubbish to the beach, so do your research and check your seasons!"
lifewelltraveller,"Hong Kong, China",May 2017,Perfect sunset beach. Walking along the beach from Ku De Ta to Petitinget Temple and looking the sun sets into the sea is amazing.
JJMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2017,The Seminyak public beach is quite clean. There are several hotels with private beach adjacent to the public beach. 
sarvysweet,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2017,Clean beach and good for swim.  Nice restaurants in the beach with bean bags thrown around for sitting   Not expensive   Good beach for candid pictures   Good market parallel to the beach 
3009jimmac,"Long Jetty, Australia",May 2017,Love Seminyak area and have stayed 6 times. However the actual beach is spoilt somewhat with plastic bag rubbish. 
Vincent M,5 contributions,May 2017,Enjoying my time here.  Staff is helpful by far the most comfortable bed and the shower is amazing.  They have free shuttle buggie to beach and market. Liquor store right across the street 
AsiaTravelHero,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2017,"Long beach along Seminyak. Unfortunately Bali is so busy, the beach here didn't seem to get looked after. Lots of plastic bags, rubbish and even glass found on the beach. Unfortunate. The touts along the beach were also trying to charge ridiculous money for beach chairs. Advice would be to ignore the ones that are near the entry points to the beach and speak to the sellers further away. The price continuously drops as you say no to each beach chair mafia person."
Asiaunknown_com,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2017,The beach is beautiful That is in front of the private tourist properties.  Sadly the beach in front of the property owner by the locals such as the templates etc is one big garbage dump.   This makes the long walk on the beach a sad and discusting experience.  Shame on you.
Dara-Khmer,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,"Well it's a nice view. But a little surprised at the rubbish on the high tide markI guess I shouldn't be given the infrastructure along the beach but given this is Bali, just thought it would be better"
MYK712,"Huddersfield, UK",May 2017,Lovely beach. Great waves. Watch the undercurrents though and take heed of what the lifeguards tell you. Sun lounger haggleto get 2 for 150k. Best Bakso in Bali is the guy with the street food cart just at the beach entrance. 
Anthony_Close,"Chicago, IL",May 2017,"John and Jevi run the best chairs and umbrella's on double six.  Just drive down until you get to the ""Seaside Mexican Restaurant"" it has a blue sign and is right after the circle K.  Enter the beach near there and ask where Gee Wiz Bar is.  They will point you towards the yellow and green umbrella's.  "
Ann C,"London, UK",May 2017,"This is a beautiful beach and when we visited there were few people around, but the local facilities are shabby.The showers to wash away the sand were all broken and very dirty. I didn't bother using the toilets because they were terrible.It's a shame because Bali is such a beautiful place with such lovely people, but this put me off going back to the beach."
iamrawat,"Pune, India",Feb 2017,I wasn't sure if I should go to the beach because of the reviews I read but since I decided to dine in an Indian restaurant in semniyak I paid a visit to the beach too.. Well the beach as many have mentioned is dirty and plagued with hawkers who keep disturbing you. But what makes up for it is the beautiful sunset. Visit in the evening to enjoy the sunset and dine if you wish to.
Marleyspiji91,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"Seminyak beach is the perfect spot for the sunset.It's just amazing! The beach is huge, you can enjoy the sunset from anywhere you'd like.Surfing lessons recommended, so cheap!"
Kimkortekaas,Bali,Apr 2017,"So Seminyak beach is a nice beach if you want to learn how to surf or just spend the day with a few bintangs, enjoy the sun and read a good book. It's not a beautiful beach, can get dirty especially during the raining season.The waves can get quite high so it dangerous to swim especially with small children. Sunsets however are amazing!"
Lisa W,10 contributions,Jan 2017,"Walked along this dirty, litter strewn beach to get to Potato Head and watch the sunset. Wouldn't want to go in and Potato Head is an overpriced tourist destination so prepare to pay. "
duhoz,"Beroun, Czech Republic",Apr 2017,"I found this beach as average and disappointing. Quite clean, without any shade to hide apart the overpriced umbrellas and deckchair for rent (IDR 250.000 per day).The sea is clean but great waves are good for surfers not for swimming. Also too low tide makes water shallow for swimming, jgood just to sit and let the water pass around you. You are also heavily bothered by hawkers. However the beach is nice for endless strolling around. But sunset is spectacular many tourist and locals gather here to watch it. If do not want to sit on the beach you can laze in the bar, sipping beer and admire the sunset."
Harrytol,"Sneek, The Netherlands",May 2017,Don't let your kids swim here! The waves and current is to strong! Almost always red flag so good warning at the beach. The beach restaurants are simpel but in good relax atmosfere... Ideal for wave surfers!
Brendan248,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,Walked along here from kuta and legian. Found legian beach to be the cleanest. Seminyak seemed to have a lot more rubbish washed up.....perhaps not cleaned as regularly??
Febry B,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2017,It's a great place to watch sunset and they have plenty of bar and restaurants to chill and have drinks. Music and live band performance make your evening feeling more romantic. 
Linda D,"Nelson Bay, New South Wales, Australia",May 2017,Just ok wouldn't recommend dirty but lots of eating places that are nice. Better beaches to visit in Bali
rosacu,"Attadale, Australia",May 2017,This a beach for walking and enjoying the fresh air. Large waves are noisy so not for swimming. Beach bars are good.
sals11274,"Nuneaton, UK",May 2017,"Not the greatest beach. Ugly brown sand and not good for swimming as the waves are huge. You also get harassed quite regularly by the beach sellers when you are trying to relax on your (rented) sun lounger. It is however quite a spectacular sunset point but we still only visited once, there are many better beaches in Bali."
Cassie T,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,"If you come from a pristine country like Australia, very few beaches elsewhere can compete and so it is the case in Bali; but Seminyak Beach was 7 minutes walk to our hotel and allowed us access along the whole stretch of Seminyak and Kerobokan beaches. It is faster to walk along beach front to say Potato Head Beach Club than to use the winding roads in Seminyak. We used it as our quick access to some other places like Petitenget Temple."
lindsaysmith3,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,I just love the beach here. It really doesn't matter what time of the day you go to the beach.  It truly is amazing & always buzzing with excitement.
Brad J,"Mandurah, Australia",May 2017,Visited Seminyak for the first time and was disappointed with the beach. The sand was grey and had a lot of rubbish washed up on the sand or was dropped there by selfish tourists. The locals do try to keep it clean but it is littered with rubbish. Casual dining along the beach at night with live music at most venues leads to a relaxed evening.
kydo40,"Mt Eliza, Australia",May 2017,Great for a long walk and people watching but a noisy spot to relax. We enjoyed walking along the beach early in the morning but avoided it late afternoon.
Sandy PH,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,The view during sunset is great. Explains all the beach bar in the area.The beach is much cleaner than Kuta beach and there are less people
Michelle B,"Noosa, Australia",May 2017,"Great beach to stroll along. Dark sand.  We didn't enter the water but saw lots of people swimming.  Looked like there were lots of rips. Vendors selling kites, sarongs, sunglasses and jewellery.  Hire a sunbed, buy a beer or learn to surf."
ExploreWithHappySi,Doha,May 2017,"spent one evening, but would love to come back..great place for shopping, sunset and just enjoy around."
Vanessa T,"Tauranga, New Zealand",May 2017,"ok, so maybe i am being harsh, but its just a beach, we have the Mount Beach here in NZ and some amazing beaches to be had.  this one was overtaken by heaps of Australians blobbed out, getting drinks, the water was not that clean and i would not have put my head under for anything."
RxVacation,"San Dimas, CA",May 2017,"We did not realized coming into Bali that the beach at Seminyak was really not swimmable and more for surfing, so we were kinda bummed on this, however, it does allow for endless hours of walks along the beach and the water in May was very comfortable and delightful. "
Janine W,8 contributions,May 2017,"Looks like a great surf beach, we walked a small way along it , was a rough day so no swimming allower"
Polley17,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",May 2017,"What can I say, there are a lot of great beaches over in Bali, however I didn't see anything special about this beach. It is still a nice beach to see and swim but there is a lot of other beaches that you can choose from. It smells at times from the water running off from the Seminyak itself.And be prepared to be bothered by the people selling stuff and coming up to you when you're relaxing.Overall, it is just a beach with no real special qualities but if you want to go to a beach and am close to this one then you will be able to swim and relax by it if you like. "
Sandra Derksen,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands",Apr 2017,"We made some nice strolls on the beach, visited few beachbars, where you can chill and watch sunset enjoying nice food and drinks. The beach is wide until you reach the sea. Sea is warm with high waves. Good for surfing and kiting."
chris g,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Hire a boogy board, or just relax on a sun lounge. for a quiet beach enter through Ku-De-Ta security gate."
obygold,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,Many places rent sun bed and umbrellas quite cheaply. The sand itself is generally of good quality and you can use the beach to either relax or seeing sunset. We loved this beach and it holds many fond memories for us
Fey N,79 contributions,Jun 2016,Clean and nice Long Beach walk to go best in morning and evening time.See the sunset in this ocean will be absolutely beautiful and must to try.
butchame,ararat,May 2017,"Great staff, lovely food but owner was on site and DID NOT Acnowledge Australian visitors. His agourance will make me stay elsewhere else but here "
B2wh,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,"First time to Seminyak Beach and feel disgusting with all the dirty and black sand beaches. Not good for swimming buy good for surfing. Thought can have a quiet sun tan at there, but everything there have to pay, we cant just lay our towel there, so no choice sit at one of the cafe and order drink..annoying was the beach vendors are everywhere. They keep asking you to buy something or massage. Quite disappointed with Bali. Anyway the sunset was very beautiful though.."
StantonJR,"Staines, UK",Apr 2017,"Standing and viewing the endless beach stretching before you is breathtakingly awesome.  The sea rolls in with large breakers, which are perfect for the surfers and again, watching them battle against the elements is a sight that never ceases to amaze.  However, walk along the beach and there is rubbish strewn about.  In some places the beach is discoloured and you can see why from the effluence in the water.  I did not venture in it and I certainly was amazed that others let their children anywhere these obviously polluted parts.  It was a great disappointment and made me wish that I had chosen anywhere else in Bali other than Seminyak/Kota.  They would do well to organise parties of people to clean the beach each day and then it might be a safer and more beautiful attraction.  "
William,"Beirut, Lebanon",Apr 2017,"Seminyak Beach has amazing sunset views, the sand is black and the sea is rough but the views are a wonderful pass for me"
Winterfamily4u,"Geelong, Australia",May 2017,Great sunset and bars on seminyak beach.You do get hassled but hey it's BaliJust luv the beach Bali atmosphere 
boshmickey,"Tupelo, MS",May 2017,"I visited Seminyak Beach with a friend following a wedding in Ubud. To put it short, it could be beautiful, but the trash makes it dirty and not a great location. I may be spoiled by the clean white sand of the Gulf of Mexico along with crystal clear water...this had neither. I'll try another beach on the next visit."
RhiannaWeston13,"Mandurah, Australia",May 2017,Went to go to la planche but was busy so went next door to Bali juice park. The sunset is amazing and so much to watch . Go around 5pm and enjoy the sights 
Jana P,"Bristol, UK",May 2017,To be honest I nearly cried when I went to Seminyak Beach. Very dirty around and you are not able to swim in the ocean as the waves are really high. First visit and my last visit. Definitely wouldn't recommend it.
579sharon,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,We unfortunately didn't spend much time on the beach as we were sight seeing but its a stunning beach with a lot happening for everyone
Vicki T,3 contributions,Apr 2017,Didn't like the beach at all.the sand was black and the surf was rough..i will stick to the swimming pools..
Gerard B,83 contributions,Oct 2016,We stayed at the W October & November 2016. Could not speak too highly of the place.We had a suite and it was sensational.The staff were ever helpful and friendlyGreat Value for money.
Devieapriliani,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2017,Enjoying evening walk in beach was a very pleasant things to do after working.Here you can try to eat meatballs or Roasted corn while enjoying the sunset. There are also some cafes and restaurants that offer different sensations to enjoy the atmosphere of the night on the beach.
benjiwave,"Geelong, Australia",Apr 2017,"Great for a paddle during the day, and a great place to enjoy a few beers and watch the sun set with the wife."
Toon34,"Greater Perth, Australia",May 2017,"Weather amazing most of the day and night, never had a breeze most of the day before so lovely and warm but low humidity great time of year to be in Bali. And not many yobbos so Allah good."
Amelia K,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",May 2017,Quite Crowded but not as dirty as Kuta or Legian. The sunset is just gorgeous. They have event called SOS - Sunset on Seminyak. 
djelc,"Chichester, UK",May 2017,"The beach itself isn't really that pretty as it has mostly black volcanic sand and alot of the gutter water from the island runs across the sand into the sea, which doesn't smell to clean. But through the day it's great for surfing and at sunset it comes alive with music. So good if that's what your after."
123susan456,"Lake City, FL",May 2017,After being in the phillipines and the islands in thailand i am very very dissapointed in the beach here.  Just an ordinary nothing special beach
gtahlia,"Washington DC, DC",May 2017,"The bars are rather more upmarket, beach was nice, but had a bunch of signs up for No swimming. I even got a chair and a massage on the beach there"
Wetwedgie,"London, UK",May 2017,"Spent our last night in Seminyak, before returning to London. Ventured to the beach before lunch, not a great experience.The beach, like Kuta Beach, is crazy and packed with people. Quite hard to relax or even take anything in with the consent - ""you want drink?, you buy?, massage?, you buy you buy?"" Avoid if you can"
MichaelWWest,"Kibworth Beauchamp, United Kingdom",May 2017,Big big beach but quite disappointed with quality of the sand & cleanliness.Very busy though for sunset which is stunning Maybe in the future it will improve 
Agnes S,2 contributions,May 2017,"clean, and lovely place to go. We had a great time with all friends and spending our time to catch sunset there."
Sunai W,"Mae Rim, Thailand",May 2017,A bit too crowded for me but nice sunset beach scene which a lot people will hang around with lots of club
Emma W,"Altea, Spain",May 2017,"Beautiful beach to stroll along, you can take more or less endless walks. There are plenty of places to stop for drinks or food. From what we saw, most of the beach is clean. There are however some patches with garbage and brownish water that doesn't look very healthy to swim in.We stayed in seminyak for five days in early May, not sure if the waves are always this high, but there were red flags more or less everywhere prohibiting from swimming. So if you fancy swims far out in the ocean or floating around in the water, this is not the right beach to go to"
AllyRogo,"Point Lonsdale, Australia",May 2017,"If surfing is your thing this beach is for you. The waves were huge! As for the rest of the beach, it is quite sad really. There wasn't a whole lot of rubbish but around the drainage areas it smelled of sewerage. Heaps of dogs around which was great for a dog lover. Not many strays either. We walked along early in the morning, around 8 so no hawkers. It was nice, but I think we are a bit spoilt in Australia with amazing white sandy beaches. "
Jamie M,2 contributions,May 2017,"Dirty black sand, lots of hawkers was also hard to find. Has Day beds available to utilise but only as a duo no more than two beds near each other "
KittyT,50 contributions,May 2017,"Such a lovely beach to relax and watch the sun go down. This beach is no where near as busy as Kuta and the vibe is more relaxed and laid back. Different bats have chairs and bean bags set up on the sand with umbrellas and small tables so you don't need to move. The sellers will come up to you with various wares (from sunglasses to fairy floss) but they're not as aggressive as in some other parts as you are sitting in the designated area of a restaurant. The only drawback is that the bathrooms are not pleasant to use - the public ones cost money and are not clean and many of the restaurant ones are not clean either - bring some tissues and hand sanitiser just in case. Lovely, relaxed evening watching the sun go down! "
Carly E,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,We went for a walk on the beach it's stunning at sunset! There is lots of sellers on the beach however just say no and keep walking unless you are interested lol
Guillaume T,"Ottawa, Canada",May 2017,The beach is great as clean. Lots of activity. Come with lots of street vendors but it is to be expected. A quick no and they leave you alone... nice sunset on the sitting bean bags... overall good place to go!!! 
Aminur R,4 contributions,Apr 2017,"Was our local beach during our stay in Bali and was only 25 minute walk through the busy, colourful and vibrant eat street and Seminyak square.Visited during the day and during sunset and there was a lot of beach to stroll down when we wanted to. The waves are wonderful to watch as the get bigger and more aggressive and sun loungers are easily available with young coconut and ice cream vendors regularly passing by.We got loungers for 1 hour at 25K Rupiah which seemed like a good price and added a young coconut to the day visit as well.The water and the sand is clean and the beach wasn't overcrowded at all. Sunset was set to be epic as you get a clear view of the horizon but alas on the evening we went the clouds decided to crowd around the sun as it set.I know other more secluded beaches provide more pristine waters and sands but Seminyak beach doesn't charge to access it which is always nice.Our only regret was not visiting the beach more often but our private villa did spoil us as well."
oliverc197,43 contributions,May 2017,"Not the nicest beach in Bali, but ok. Full of pricey flash beach clubs if that's your thing. Better to venture to the Bukit peninsula for nicer beaches and clearer water! Try balangan beach/ Sundays beach club/ uluwatu / Padang Padang..."
MykeAlpha,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2017,"Here is the infamous one and only Seminyak beach. Nice beach bars, cool crowd and lots of activities. The sea is always wavy so if you're not a surfer, you might not like it."
Gail H,22 contributions,May 2017,"Lovely location to watch the sunset. Great bars with bean bags, pretty umbrellas and great music! Visited Taris Bali for a lovely iced tea post massage. "
Elizabeth D,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Seminyak beach is quite beautiful and differs from Kuta in that is is cleaner and less crowded.  We walked down to Legian for our usual brunch and drink and enjoyed the peacefulness.  There are some great hotels that open up to the beach and generally you can go in to the cafes.  If in doubt, don't be put off by the security guard and ask them if you can go  in.  If you are approached by a hawker, simply say no thanks and keep walking, and they will not pursue you (as a rule). The beach at night is misty with the waves gently crashing on the beach, and I recommend you find a great restaurant that opens up to the beach for a beautiful evening of fine dining. If it is with someone you love, then all the better."
BTSS,"Carrum, Australia",May 2017,"Walking along the beach each day bought new & interesting delights! There's so much going on, you can't possibly see or experience it all in 1 day, & the nightlife along the beach is just fantastic & right up my alley!! "
Inukshukasia,Asia,May 2017,One of the most tranquil beaches in Bali great for sunset drinks.  Also if you are a beginner surfer this is the place to start 
Vazerol,"Lantsch/Lenz, Switzerland",Oct 2016,"Wonderful resort lined by a great beach, with numerous hotels, shops and restaurants. Gateway for tours around the island, for instance to Ubud."
michael t,"Perth, Australia",May 2017,"Spent the day at Seminyak beach ,it would no be a beach I would bring kids to ,tere is a lot of rubbish in the water and broken beer bottles in the sand not very safe for swimming either as tere was a strong rip beers was cheap $2.50 per bottle of Bintang "

Madhumati I,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,It's a good beach to visit and enjoy the view. Accessible via bike or car. No parking fee. Clean and not much crowded. We went on Friday.
R G,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2017,"Not the sort of beach you would head to for a days swimming in the sheltered safe waters.I would imagine that if you wanted to paddle maybe (although the water didn't look that clean - brown colour) but appeared more to be for surfers with big waves.I'd imagine the sea is quite strong.If you want to walk along the beach the sea front is quite wide (compared to other beaches in Bali) so all ok.Good place to watch the sunset if you feel so inclined. Lots of places to sit, eat and drink also. Some venues also have live music."
jscyn,37 contributions,Jun 2016,"Seminyak beach is definitely not white sand which I prefer, but the beach itself is dirty and full of trash. There is really nothing special for me with this beach"
Kamariah1951,Australia,May 2017,"Courtyard Marriott Seminyak provides excellent service to their Private Beach. There are wifi, towels, water even ice blocks. Friendly staff as always. We cannot fault anything. Great service as always. "
summersky13,"Montreal, Canada",Apr 2017,The beach in Seminiak is not everywhere recommended for bathing. While visiting and walking along the beach I realized that in some places where the water is really dirty and I am not so sure that is not coming from sewages. Plus the huge waves are the delight of surfers not swimmers. If you visit with a small child make sure it stays far from the water due to waves and fast curents
SunnytheTraveller,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2017,Best sunset beach by far when it's low tide. High tide is dramatic but the surf is for experts only. 
FabioOliveira86,"Lucerne, Switzerland",May 2017,Dark sand dirty beach ! ( water is very dirty ) orherwise is great ! Nice bars ( day and night)at the beach with live bands performing !
Nomadman411978,"London, UK",May 2017,Seminyak Beach is a good beach without being spectacular. However the sunsets make up for that and during the day the sand is good enough but the sea can be rough.
davemickle2015,Walsall UK,May 2017,Nice beach but a little unclean and not white sand.  There is a terrific incoming waves at all times and it is not suitable for just normal bathing
Tim D,"Geraldton, Australia",May 2017,"Not as crowded as Kuta but offering all the same, food was great night shows even better, live gigs up and down the beach, grab a bean bag sit back and enjoy"
David C,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,The sand is beautiful and soft and when the tide is out there is vast amounts of sand.  Was different than our golden sand on the Gold Coast with black sand mixed in.  The sun sets into the ocean and is magical. 
Dale H,"Darwin, Australia",May 2017,"Not a lot of sand to relax on, dumping waves. At least you dont get overly hassled to buy stuff.Better beaches around to enjoy, or enjoy a hotel pool."
Maddie,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Most breathtaking, warming, magical sunset I've ever seen ! Walked all the way along the beach, lots of little warungs and places to stop and take on the view. Enjoy ! "
Novia K,91 contributions,Jul 2016,"The decent place to kill the time by lazying at the beach bench until sunset, enjoying local foods, beers."
Charl√®ne L,"Menton, France",May 2017,Full of tourist people who just want to spend money and are superficial. The beach isn't beautiful. Women's who comes every 30 minutes trying to sell jellery or other stuff. If you are looking for tranquility it's definitely not the right place ! 
cdjenks,Bft,Apr 2017,Nice beach with good views and plenty of clubs and cafes available as you walk along.There are hawkers but buying a few wish lanterns from one and set them off was a lovely experience !
ahmedelbialy,Egypt,Sep 2016,You can do any water activities in this place except swimming as It will be very difficult because of very high waves 
Appu S,"Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India",Mar 2017,"Compared to the beaches in Uluwatu, seminyak is not that great but it still is a good enough place to go in case you have nothing to do."
t0ngdee,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,The waves at the beach was great! Very gd for surfing... sand was fine and the crowd was gd as well. Recommended to at least take a walk down the beaches
thespellofrepetition,54 contributions,Apr 2017,Great beach to wander down to check out the beach front hotel bars and watch the sunset. Great place to catch some waves when the surfs up. Bit rough for swimming however.
nurseladyAtlanta,Atlanta,Apr 2017,"Soft brown sand, big waves, mostly clear water. Current is too strong for many swimmers, experienced surfers will be happy. Can be crowded in areas near public parks and access points, and will get visibly dirtier in these same areas with trash littering the sand and surf in some places and the occasional smell of sewage. Overall a good beach to visit, choose areas near nicer resorts for best experience."
990harshadb,138 contributions,Apr 2017,Reached here at dark so just got an ok view of the beach but enjoyed the dinner at the shack wit nice breeze and gud music also good food had fun wished had come in daylight.
adizazuli,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2016,Seminyak beach is which one beach in Bali. Perfect to see sunset and surfing too. And many beach bar surrounding.
Manikarn M,"Mannheim, Germany",Apr 2017,"We have been to Seminayak beach during our stay in Seminayak,Bali. Beach is clean from perspective of Solid dirt like Polythene etc. Sea water has much higher current than Kuta Beach. Number of people can be seen there doing surf.Best Thing: Branded eating outlets on beach like potato head, less crowded, good for walk.Beautiful pic background and scenes for sunset. Near to Tanha lot temple.Bad Thing: Sewer water for Seminayak drops in to sea so little messy in between. Overall worth spending time!!"
Putu Eka W,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2016,It is the cleanest beach in kuta. Walk to the south you will find many famous restaurant with colorful umbrella and bean bag
TavaresJorge,"Macau, China",Apr 2017,Went there a few times the beach is very big but the sea is a bit hard to swim. If you  like to swim or just chill in the water not the best beach for you. Care with the high prices for the sunbeds and the umbrellas. 
jenny c,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Currently staying at Seminyak and the beach is lovely. Yes perhaps the sand is not as perfect as our sydney sand but the view from my hotel room is spectacular and when travelling I am looking for something different from home. I have walked along the beach before in January and there was a lot of rubbish on the beach. I read this is season dependent and in the dry season you don't see the rubbish.This appears to be true. The beach is lovely and wide and easy to have a significant walk along to other beaches. Seminyak itself is a busy place. Seems to get busier with each visit. It's easier than what it use to be to walk along the streets but still would be difficult for someone who struggled with mobility. A zillion great restaurants here to choose from. All up a great place to stay
Pankti Shah,"Vadodara, India",Jan 2017,"The posh area of beaches, Seminyak Beach is home to features that every modern day man desires in a beach. It is house to world class chef‚Äôs food. There is also many shopping options for clothing and fashion."
ritapetita,glasgow,Apr 2017,Amazing..loved it..lots of fab places to eat and shopping is good. Somd beautiful hotels especially on beachfront
Nelwin C,1 contribution,Apr 2017,"My first visit to bali and had no inclination of sightseeing or touring there.  Found great reviews of The Cheapest Travel in Bali. my questions were quickly answered and i booked an full day tour with them.  Our driver promptly arrived at our hotel and we started our tour. Dewa our driver was very courteous and answered all our question about the tour and even the history of Bali. His politeness, knowledge were on track and very helpful.  He accompanied us on our tour and made sure we were comfortable as we entered the chosen places to visit. Dewa's caring and assistance made our tour a wonderful experience. I will definitely use this company again and hopefully have our driver Dewa again. i will highly recommend this company to all my friend and family visiting Bali.  Thank you Anantha and Dewa for your exemplanary"
Diennick,29 contributions,Apr 2017,Good beach to watch the sunset and play games. Very wide and large but also very busy. There are many bars/restaurants that have beds or sitbags for the day.
Menehune808,"Hilo, HI",Apr 2017,The beaches are long and sandy.  Large breaks to shore and easy to wade but not swimming for beginners.  Body surfer would love these shorebreaks and surfers the outside breaks.
Vanessa P,"Surbiton, UK",Apr 2017,I didn't like Semiyak beach at all. Went there once. In fact Semiyak was not what I was expecting. It's really busy with lots of traffic taxi drivers constantly hooting. I just didn't feel relaxed. It felt like we where in a hot noisy city full of designer shops and to find a nice beach you had to go to a beach club with a minimum spend. We left after a few days even though we had a hotel. We also had a lot of trouble getting cash out. Make sure when using cash machine you press checking account as it has 3 options and you press the wrong one and you don't get any money. A lot of the machines kept running out of money. Everyone from all over the world had trouble getting cash. Always get a blue bird taxi as they have to use the meter and they are much cheaper. You can download the app before you come called my bluebird taxi. I went all over Bali and I found the people very friendly everywhere. And if you learn thank you and a bit of Balinese they love it. Oh if you like wine ( like me) bring it from duty free as it's expensive everywhere in Bali. Semiyak is not the place for cheap shopping either. It's all expensive cloths shops and we found prices cheaper in Kuta. 
yosef_santoso,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"Nice beach,not crowded as kuta beach and this beach more clean than kuta,many foreigner here especially western"
Sk8nsnogrl,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2017,Seminyak beach was a black sand beach with rough waves and not too clean. I totally would recommend a different beach if you want to see crystal clear water and beautiful sand. 
John M,3 contributions,Apr 2017,"Does the job but beach loungers are abit pricey. Would visit again but it's not a calm beach so be aware, maybe not so suitable for younger kids"
Anita A,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2017,"Only walked this beach, didn't swim and it was lovely, lots of resturaunts along the way that are amazing "
Theoda F,"Toledo, OH",Apr 2017,This beach would be very ideal if it qasnt for being asked 30 times to buy some souvenirs from the beach roamers..
gsraju2k,"Visakhapatnam, India",Apr 2017,"Visited this beach on 19 th April with my wife and son. Although it's a sunny day we felt comfortable with cool breeze from the sea. As we relaxed in one of the beautifully arranged big umbrellas for shade,our son enjoyed the surfing. Nice place to spend leasurly."
blnotman,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"So much rubbish washing ashore, could not bring myself or our group to go swimming- such a shame sunset was beautiful. "
Li√®ge M,"Espinho, Portugal",Apr 2017,Beautiful but with pollution of cloacal waste  whats makes it not healthy for bath..I don't want to come back 
Mark O,"Kirkby-in-Ashfield, UK",Apr 2017,"This is for anyone visiting,  or thinking of visiting Seminyak this year (2017).These are only our own opinions based on our recent holiday there. GETTING THERE: Most people will arrive via Denpasar Airport, and from the arrivals hall you'll enter a very busy area with hordes of people holding name boards,  and even more taxi drivers vying for your business.  My advice here is to ensure that you've pre-booked a taxi through your hotel. Your (c30 min) journey to your Seminyak hotel will then be easier and probably less expensive.  Our pre-booked taxi cost ¬£15.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok, Denpasar and environs is never going to win any beauty awards, if you're familiar with the Far East then the ramshackle set-up, the huge volume of crazily driven scooters, and the antithesis to Western order won't come as a shock, but if Bali is your first time east of the Mediterranean then be patient and stick with it.  Seminyak has been designed for enjoyment whilst Denpasar is a capital city with few reasons to linger.Seminyak is quite compact and this review only encompasses this area and not Kuta. The vast majority of the accommodation in town is either beach facing,  or a short walk from the beach.HOTELS: Whilst we can only comment specifically on one, the excellent Taum Resort, we saw enough of the others during our stay to build a very favourable opinion on standards,  most were 4* and quite a few the vaunted 5* quality, and they looked every inch comparable with the best beach hotels in Europe. We saw a number of very smart beachfront hotels with sun decks, pools and lovingly manicured gardens, where the almost daily stunning sunsets could be enjoyed in blissful surroundings. NIGHTLIFE : This is where Seminyak scores highly.  It's set-up for people who like to enjoy life once the sun goes down - but that said,  it's not trying to be an Ibiza. We felt that the beating heart of Seminyak was given over to couples,  irrespective of age (we're 40's and 50's), and testimony to this were the range of other couples that we met during our stay; the vast majority being Australian  (3 hrs flight from Perth for example ). Lots of 'gap year' youngsters and 'Eat, Pray, Love' wannabe types looking for adventure or love (or both). They'd all gravitated to the right place, heaps of great bars and restaurants and enough high-end nightspots to please every taste,  budget and preference,  most people will have heard of Potato Head and Ku De Ta etc, they're very good as you'd expect, but look beyond them and the supporting cast will enthrall you and your money will go a long way. Although just examples and exchange rates will fluctuate, you'll find most bars trying to lure you in with 2-1 cocktails or 2-1 Happy Hour deals for around (UK) ¬£1.50 for the beer (Bintang is the excellent local beer) and ¬£3 for the cocktails,  compare this to London prices and you'll be in the slightly unusual position of feeling mildly wealthy.  Eating out bears similar fruit and we enjoyed some brilliant food in extremely atmospheric restaurants for Wetherspoons type prices! For a couple of personal recommendations try La Laguna, Ginger Moon, Batik, Grocer & Grind,  but there are nany more as good.  In short then, tons of choice,  fantastic service wherever you go,  and very kind on your pocket  (have you booked yet?).SAFETY: This one comes in two parts.  If you're reading this and you're an adult,  or going with other adults,  then this will be the safest place you've ever been unless you drink too much,  if you get drunk then at some point you're likely to fall foul of the 2-wheeled 24/7 carnage that is the half a billion scooters that compete for space on the narrow Seminyak streets, these things are literally everywhere and at times the lunatic drivers (term used loosely ) will mount the kerb and use the footpath. Many of the scooters appear to be carrying at least 3 generations of the same family and they'll all have aboard items such as ladders, power saws, live animals and the sort of stuff we'd need a Qashqai to transport. We took photos of the aforementioned just because we figured the folks back home wouldn't believe us! Crossing the road in Bali would be classed as a dangerous sport in the Uk, but help is normally on hand courtesy of the ubiquitous security guards, who guard everything.  They all carry illuminated batons and make full use of the whistles that they also carry, if they spot that you're struggling to cross the road then they're out there in a jiffy to see you safely across.  Top boys.The pavements are hilarious in that one minute they're there,  and then the next minute they've either ended abruptly at a large chasm,  or a  set of neck height power lines (not kidding) ,  or....the pavement just reappears on the opposite side of the street. So, given the last point,  I'd implore any parents with babies,  toddlers,  or pre-teen children to take a holiday elsewhere,  because we saw so many anguished parents frantically trying to either control their kids next to the Nurbergring town roads,  or trying to stop enough of the wacky races participants in order to get to the other side,  hugely dangerous and quite disturbing to see. Bali is lovely but small children brought up with UK road sense are in peril here.Like I said earlier, sensible adults will have no issues here. BEACH : This was a shock to us. When we booked our holiday we of course Googled Bali (Seminyak) beach images,  and feasted our eyes on the stunning shots. In reality there are times when the long Seminyak Beach is quite the opposite. In the wet season it rains regularly and when it does the stuff cones down in torrents,  add to this the generally observed habit of throwing most litter into the gutter,  then you'll quickly realise that all of the litter is quickly washed into surface water culverts that themselves wash into the small rivers that flow through the town. These then run straight into the sea,  and the tide deposits the whole lot on the tide line early doors the next morning! ! Take a beach stroll on the morning after one of the regular evening thunderstorms and you'll see what I mean.; absolutely shocking mess and not safe for walking on as you can imagine.  The Balinese seem to employ a small army of people (many wearing face masks and PPE) plus tractors to try and make good this mess every day.  When this has been done then large swathes of the beach do justice to the brochure images,  but just be aware that at times the beach can be quite awful and there has to be some effort made to try and improve the littering situation which I have to say is more down to the locals,  than the visitors!TAXIS: Worthy of its own section,  the town is chock full of taxis and this whirring convoy just seems to endlessly circulate around the centre (AKA Seminyak Square) looking for anyone 'walking '. We deduced that when Balinese taxi drivers take their training course their first instruction is the assumption that someone walking is in dire need of a fare-paying lift! From the second you creep beyond the wall of your hotel EVERY taxi driver will hit his horn and slow down,  many will stop and wind down their window and wait for you to agree that 'yes....you can't possibly walk 100 metres to the beach / bar / shop, and that you need a lift'.  The trick is to either smile and carry on walking, or just ignore them. Both methods work equally well but the good news is that these guys aren't the least bit pushy or aggressive. You get used to the patter and we assume that they get used to just driving around all day.That said, be advised of the ongoing scams. The ONLY officially licensed taxis are Blue Bird. That doesn't help you with recognition because in Bali EVERY taxi is blue and the same model  (Toyota ) as the official ones!  Also many of the unlicensed taxis have the name 'Blue XXXX' that look almost identical to the pucker version. The difference being that if you ride in a dodgy taxi then the driver will either say ""meter not working"", or when you arrive at your destination,  he will say ""no change"". The latter is a patent lie of course, and if you enter a taxi with ""broken meter "" then get straight out. We of course fell fowl of both on day one, but a very helpful 'official ' Blue Bird driver apprised us of the dark side of Seminyak taxis on day two,  citing that unlicensed drivers face fines if caught with dodgy meters or if they're discourteous to customers.  In summary we found the whole taxi topic amusing,  and I'd also add that almost every driver  stopped or slowed down if they saw that we wanted to cross the street.In terms of fares. From our hotel to either the beach or Seminyak Square,  both a 30 min walk,  we'd pay the minimum evening fare of IDR 30.OOO. Which worked out at ¬£2 at the March exchange rate of IDR 16000 to ¬£1. MONEY: I've alluded to the generally very agreeable cost of eating and drinking out, taxis I've also said are cheap,  and with a total absence of other means of public transport you might want to engage your hotel in finding a locally recommended driver. We hired a friendly driver who took us all around the island for ¬£30 per day, try doing that in the UK and you'll be adding another '0', fantastic value and all of the drivers speak good English  (as do almost all Balinese ).There are numerous ATM's dotted around Seminyak and my wife and I used different ATM's with our respective banks and the exchange rates worked out at broadly the same as the exchange rates that we'd been given prior to setting off from the UK. If you're a single female traveller and are conscious of security with your cards / money then there are a couple of cash machines inside the new shopping mall in Seminyak Square, the latter housing some good shops,  but tons of better ones that aren't generic 'high street' around the town that are well worth a look.  THE PEOPLE : If you've been to Thailand then you'll be sitting there thinking that 'nobody is friendlier than the Thai's', I know you're thinking that because we thought so, too. But come here and you'll be truly in the presence of the nicest people on God's green Earth. We were humbled by their humility,  their values,  their sheer desire to make a difference to your day. The service we received in every single venue, bar, hotel, or even total strangers in the street was so genuine,  so wonderful,  that to not come back to Bali would be a crime. Come and see for yourself,  if you've been promising yourself  / husband / wife / partner to take a trip to Bali then go to your bank tomorrow,  or beg a wealthy relative for funds,  sell that useless artefact or trade-in the boat you never used,  and drag your weary body to this temple of soul salvation, I promise you that you will enjoy every moment and you'll return to our embittered crime -ridden soulless country a better person.SEMINYAK: Yes it's a fabulous destination.  It's not without its faults and I'd advocate it's not fit for young children or the infirm,  but if your mojo has lost its sparkle then this is the place to lift your spirits. Great hotels, great nightlife, and incredible people. WEATHER: There are two main seasons in Bali. Hot and wet and hot and dry. We came end of March which is towards the end of the wet season. We had rain almost every day but in the main the rain and thunderstorms came late afternoon or during the night. When it rains it comes down in torrents but the temperature doesn't drop,  meaning it gets very humid. When the sun comes out it's blistering hot and most days the mercury will climb up to 32c (90f in old money ) and often beyond. The actual temperature feels hotter so the 'real feel' in the daytime is more like 40c (104f). Bear that in mind if you're fair skinned!  At night the thermometer rarely dips below 25c (77f) so you'll not need to bring outer layers here save for a rain mac. What disappointed me was the appalling lack of weather forecast detail available online in the lead up to our holiday.  The BBC didn't feature a single location on Bali,  others just gave a  generic 'cut and paste ' tropics forecast, and the go-to Wunderground  (Weather Underground ) gave pessimistic forecasts which simply stated ""cloud,  frequent thunderstorms "" for most of the days we were there,  and whilst 'yes' we did get some cloud and some storms,  the latter's forecasts made no mention of the 5-6 hours of blazing sunshine that we got each day. Only one day out of 12 was 'bang on' their prediction. So I'm saying don't take too much notice of the forecasts before you come out here,  they're not accurate enough!  Have a great time.  "
Andy M,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"Seminyak is just full of high end shops and bars and very expensive beach clubs and hotels.The beach is very average the water doesn't not clean, you only have to look in the little creeks to feed onto the beach to see the quality of the water , most people just use the swimming poolsThe one very annoying thing is the people that drive around in early hours of the morning on loud motorbikes disturbing everybody that's trying to sleep."
Norma S,3 contributions,Apr 2017,"a place to relax and drink, you can also have live band and the best part you can have the best color of sunset and you don't need to go too far. i never get bored of this place"
nik_getmygrubon,"Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany",Apr 2017,"Seminyak beach is awesome, it has miles and miles of lovely day beach, great swells fit beginners and advanced surfers alike, a great line of nice beach clubs but unfortunately no trees whatsoever so throw you some shade. That's really complaining on a high level here but lunch hours are just so super hot. Gotta stop, am off to the beach. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
cindydk321,"Lafayette, CA",Apr 2017,"Perfect place to take a walk before it gets too hot out.  The water was so warm, the stray dogs were chilling and playing together, and the beach stretches out for miles.  I got a good walk in.  Perfect."
Greybeard111,"Ely, UK",Feb 2017,"Took a walk to see Seminyak beach, as apparently its a place to experience. From what I saw the beach was dirty, with the evidence of the previous nights' beach parties. Why can't people take their rubbish away after they had their fun. Beach hawkers were an annoying problem as well. I appreciate these people need to make a living, but would not accept my saying no to them. I'm am sure they were not Balinese. My only high light of this visit was to see a coconut being washed up on to the shoreline. If you want to experience a beach that is not cared for, then go to Seminyak Beach."
KDPop,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"I will keep this short. Most of the beaches in this region of Bali are in a complete mess. Filthy, grimy and in need of some major attention. The issue remains the ammount of businesses, hawkers, stray dogs and litter in the ocean. This on top of climate just repels you from the potential beauty that could have once been seen here in the late 70s / early 80s. "
Baxy,brisbane,Apr 2017,Dirty beach.. not worth the traveling experience. It seems to be actually cleaner down in Legian and Kuta.. Rubish all through the sand..
Peter L,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2017,Not the cleanest beach around..............lots of plastic washed up every morning. Would not recommend swimming here
MarkSalPortugal,"Hertford, UK",Apr 2017,"Parts of the beach are dirty, not clean, littered and there are lots of dogs and some dog mess. We expected the beaches and cost line to be stunning and I am sure some are, however this is not quite one of those beaches. Disappointing! "
Oktay S,"Heidelberg, Germany",Apr 2017,"The beach is nice but it is polluted. It is not the best place to swim. The waves are very strong. There are some parts where sea pulls you into the ocean. Please be careful and don't go far from beach. When you try to rest in the beach, many sellers try to sell things and never let you alone. "
Phil R,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2017,This is a great beach to walk along and enjoy the views. It is very relaxing if you are near the Seminyak area as some parts can be overcrowded. Great place for sunset or to have a drink or meal at one of the many hotels and bars.
Juanita M,7 contributions,Apr 2017,An amazing atmosphere.  Warm water and fun place to chill and have a few drinks with the sun going down.
Michael_Teoh,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"Seminyak beach are the clean and beautiful view beach,there also is a good place for surfing. Nearby have a lot great restaurant."
Marcus W,"Stockholm, Sweden",Apr 2017,"This beach is really nice to look at. Unfortunately the tide works the wrong way here as the waves become stronger as the day passes. Get a beachclub with a pool and enjoy. But sitting on this beach is not an alternative.... there are better places to sit in the sand. After 16:00 you have the best sun set in the world.... so.... take it for what it is, not how it sounds."
Dougy_Lyell,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,They try hard to keep it clean : ) .. it's a happening place for surfers and yoga instruction or mostly good walks for visitors and locals ! 
Brylie H,17 contributions,Apr 2017,Rubbish everywhere and dirty water. I wouldn't swim in it. Better beaches definitely ! Otherwise Seminyak is great
Leanne N,Bass hill,Apr 2017,"The Karma beach was beautiful, we paid AUD $50.00 for the $20.00 entrance fee & AUD $30.00 towards meals. "
bondbaby007,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Kuta beach is cleaner, by that I mean the sand is whiter and the water is clear. Or try Padang Padang, although small stretch of sand which gets really crowded.Semniyak beach is good for a stroll, watching the sunset and to admire all the luxury hotels, but go elsewhere to swim."
rachelywheeler,"Redland City, Australia",Mar 2017,"after paying $5 for a banana chair on the beach I felt like  breadcrumb thrown amongst hungry seagulls..There was no rest for hagglers.. smelt of waste products and ocean was polluted with plastic , so sad"
BlessedAloy,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,"Visit the beach just before sunset which provides great photo opportunities.  Do not bother going there for sunbathing, you will likely have to pay for your deck chair rental and also approach by the local vendors selling their products. Just visit the beach for a good photo shoot will do. You can enter the beach via the side entrance near Kudeta. "
Elli,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Amazing beach and the sea is amazing the waves are dangerous but also fun and swimmable . The evening are really good with bean bags with live bands watching the sunset. 
KATY P,"Kincumber, Australia",Feb 2017,"Seminyak beach is quite long.  It can get quite rough and it's not the most beautiful beach in Bali however it has some fantastic hotels and eateries and it's a great walk!  If you need a driver in Bali to take you there,  I can recommend Putu at fair dinkum transport and tours.  He's on tripadvisor too and took us all around seminyak"
DT8888,Singapore,Apr 2017,Great beachfront. Beach and water very clean. Sun beds from local vendors are ridiculously expensive and if you need one better go to one of the beach clubs where you get top service and a pool as well. The surf is amazing but equally dangerous. Do listen to the Lifeguards they know better than you do where it's safe to swim. In some places the current is scarily strong and can just pull you out to sea.
Lorraine C,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2017,I'm sure if you can see past the rubbish & smell in this beach it would be nice but that's a big if!!!The amount of rubbish was disgusting which def did not encourage us to stay!Avoid at all cost there are way too many nice beaches to waste time with this one 
CaseyTeh,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,Good location to busk in the beach atmosphere and watch the sunset.Great to see many locals with theirs dogs roaming along the beach together with all the tourists holidaying on this island.The sunset view was definitely worth making a trip there to enjoy it and some photo taking.
Chloe G,29 contributions,Feb 2017,"One of my favourite things about Bali is the service that you can get on the beach. I am not a beach lover usually get you can sit on the beach and order meals and drinks and not have to sit on the sand and it's awesome. You've gotta be firm with locals that are selling stuff on the beach if you're not interested in buying because if you look interested they will show you literally everything you have to offer and it can be hard to get across that you aren't interested once you have started looking which can be awkward. The sand is clean and soft, the water isn't full of rubbish but you do get the occasional piece. The waves can get pretty rough, I'm a pretty confident swimmer but some of the waves got me pretty good! Overall it's a nice place to spend your time relaxing."
Elsa N,7 contributions,Apr 2017,"Love the seminyak beach, people around here very nice, we really enjoyed and not disturbing with people offering things. And the wave its very cool for played board. We spend all day relaxing on the beach. "
Sharon L,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Love drinks on the beach at sunset in one of the many ""bars"" set up along the beach. Amazing sunsets, cool breezes & great prices. "
Lyndell P P,"Quakers Hill, Australia",Apr 2017,"Great spot, chairs & umbrellas to hire, as well as surfboards & boogie boards. Clean water, service on the beach for drinks & some but not too many hawkers"
Adi Saputro,"Salatiga, Indonesia",Apr 2017,Walk over night on this beach so peaceful l. We can enjoy the wave and wind come from the see. Really good beach for relax time !
Celine P,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2017,"It is a walking distance from the villa I stayed.  Clean, soft sands, long coast that you can enjoy walking along with sunshine.  The waves is unpredictable.  In one day it was great tides and 2 days later it got a red flag up.  Luckily I was guided by a local security, he strongly advised me that never go to the water when red flag up.  Though I saw a number of tourists and surfers ignore the flag's warning.Hope you luck to have a good and save wave to enjoy ;)"
thredbear56,"Bowral, Australia",Apr 2017,"Wouldn't swim in the ocean personally, not the cleanest of water. However if it's sunset your after then the bean bag restaurants offer a great view and some cheap eats."
Jonathand24,"Mobberley, Cheshire",Apr 2017,"And you get all sorts of life on Seminyak Beach. It all depends on what you want from a beach as to whether or not it is a good place to go.The problem here is that for every good point, there is an opposite and vice versa. Firstly this is a huge beach. At low tide very wide and it is accessed by a few gaps in the rows of restaurants, cafes and bars which line the coast usually abutting the access roads . You will pay to park, even a motorbike nearby but then it will be relatively safe. The alternative is that you will get free parking in an isolated area and have you bike pinched or complain that there are no facilities.This is an excellent beach for running especially by the water and if you go fast enough you wont be bothered by hawkers. However if you stay still for five minutes they will be all over you. Especially if you show any interest in the sunglasses, watch or Ken Holm wok that they are selling. This is truly an international problem now but they have to earn a living and they generally move on if politely addressed. The problem is that there are so many of them there is always another one to follow. Alternatively, you may just want your hair braiding, sir, or your nails varnishing whilst sitting on a beach. To be honest, you can get pretty much anything you want on Seminyak Beach except probably any peace.The water is warm but a lot of sand suspension as it is shallow. It can also be windy and because of its undisturbed length,windy and disorientating. Look out for the flags for safe swimming. A truly high point is to watch the sunset especially with a cold beer at one of the bars or walking along the sand with your partner. If my memory serves me correctly though. If you have the right partner it doesn't matter where you are.Whilst you are there you may as well go to see it."
Maysworld,"Brooklyn, NY",Apr 2017,The beach is beautiful and very powerfyl. If you're a surfer then you are in the right country. The waves are big and strong. 
George E,Dewsbury,Apr 2017,"I suppose we were naive in assuming all beaches on Bali would be like a scene from South Pacific.Seminyak beach has rather dark sand, suffers from some rubbish and a constant tide, not of sea but of touts trying to sell stuff doggedly but unenthusiastically.Umbrellas and sunbeds cost about ¬£7 each but are more comfortable than trying to lay on a towel in a high wind.The sea has a lot of suspended sand as the shoreline is very shallow.Its always good to be by the sea, however, even when its impossible to find peace.One of the tourists on the sunbed next to me (which the attendant had already sold to three others before her) was having a massage from two locals plus another one trying to sell her a hat at the same time!If you are in Seminyak and like a beach there isn't much choice but you might be a little disapointed"
Janine1926,"Geelong, Australia",Apr 2017,You can rent a sun lounge and spend day lying by the beach. Many vendors try to sell you their wares but they don't hassle you if you tell them to leave. Many great venues line the shores so you can easily get a drink in the hot sun. Don't forget to always swim between the flags. Sometimes the waves can be dumpers. Overall a nice experience which would be recommended
Mehndi Art b,9 contributions,Apr 2017,"It's an amazing beach to go for a run/ walk. We tried little workouts here too. I practiced yoga independently.Watching the sunset as we walked was bliss.Very popular for surfers because of the huge waves!There's options to hire sun beds/ bean bags to watch the sunset. Loads of bars and places to eat along the beachside. Negative factors are;1. There's a lot of washed up rubbish on the sand so watch where you step! Especially broken glass pieces on some parts.2. You have to pay to park and visit the beach. I only put this as a negative factor as it was free in Phuket Thailand! (I know I shouldn't compare but costs can build up if you're visiting daily!)3. For me, crabs! That's because they freak me out! 4. People trying to sell you stuff - a generic issue worldwide whilst travelling!"
toowelltravelled64,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"The sunset of course is legendary, but the place comes to life at night. With many beach chairs, bean lounges and music for all tastes. Nice way to spend an evening."
rohit1911,Mumbai,Mar 2017,"A must visit beach for everyone coming to Bali. It's peaceful and the night life is also good here. Enjoy a romantic stroll or just sip a beer while sitting on the bean bags, this beach will surely give you some good memories."
Rene & Bailey,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2017,It is a nice beach.The boys had some surf lessons and they did enjoy the time and the waterIt's not the last time we will go there if we are in the area.
JVNMelbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Visited 13 April 2017 for surf lesson. Firstly the beach. Grey Black sand with trash and overflowing bins. Tons of beach traders selling fake goods and hair braiding. Did not see a toilet anywhere.Sad to see stray dogs on the beach as well many of which are pregnant or have recently given birth.The water looked nice from afar but once in, was filthy and full if trash and used shopping bags and plastic.A real pity as there is huge potential. There must be better options than this.Will not return. Not recommended."
Shaheen H,54 contributions,Apr 2017,"It's a lovely beach but not white sand, you can sit at one of the food place and enjoy the view or even go for a swim and use the shower facility. So no need to pay for a sunbed on the beach. I saw some reviews saying it was full of rubbish, we didn't see any so maybe we went when it was just cleaned...."
LarryandTim,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Mar 2017,"This is a fabulous beach - wide, sandy, with moderate surf.  Very clean with a few places to eat along the beach."
humdinger,"Dublin, Ireland",Apr 2017,Disappointing beaches in seminyak. Was definitely expecting more. Not white sandy and smooth! Be prepared to see A LOT of rubbish and dirt. Such a pity to see what could be beautiful totally abused and kinda smelly. Great sunsets and waves though! 
Neco D,44 contributions,Apr 2017,Thus Beach is only 15 minutes hike from my hotel here in Seminyak. Good for sun bathing and surfing.
743kcnguyen72,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2017,"If you are a surf lover, this is it...best and biggest wave you ever seen. Very nice long stretch beach for walking. A bit dirty with trash flow on top from where am at though."
Peter_ACT_OK,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,This beach is depressing - grey sand and brown water on the day we were there but the worst thing was the litter.  I have never seen such a filthy beach.  Would not dare to walk barefoot here!
Shirley C,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2017,"This is something worth seeing during the evening, there is a beautiful sunset, hawkers, although they an be a pain when you are trying to eat evening dinner.Great ambience, on the beach watching the sunset, watching the world go buy sitting on the seating with a cold BINTANGThe beach comes alive, with the locals their dogs... kids and it's much cooler"
MayaMamaDav,"Depok, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"One of beautiful beaches in bali, near with the famous resto with colorfull umbrella named la plancha. Parents and their children will enjoy playing on the beach together"
k and m munro,"Kirkby Mallory, UK",Apr 2017,"Wouldn't swim or put my towel on that beach. It's grim! However, walk to your left and you'll come across some nice looking beds and the sea looks nicer. Try pedang pedang beach instead for a real taste of Bali "
Maritraveler,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Not a very clean beach which is unfortunate. Walking on the sand is also full of rubbish and glass so be mindfull.
Viktor P,7 contributions,Mar 2017,Nice beach for surfing not for swiming. Lot of beach bars and with beach restaurant on the night. Good for long beach walk.
103thelighthouse,"Townsville, Australia",Apr 2017,Having said that the drainage system ruins a northerly walkRelax on the beach on day beds or sip a drink in one of the many bars whilst the kids enjoy the clean beach
Don B,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"At high tide it ceases to exist, and at low tide you wade through garbage. Would not plan on going there ever."
Oscar S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,A beautiful landscape of beach for public to enjoy... there are several beach club along the beach that will ensure you to enjoy your moment and relaxation
David S,142 contributions,Apr 2017,"In a hot and humid Bali, too find Seminyak beach was a life saver. Cool wind and warm seas greeted us and we stayed and drank beers and wine till the sun went down. This is not one of the most prettiest beaches we've seen but to provide some relief with that cool breeze was priceless."
Penny D,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,Awesome place to hang out. Nice views good atmosphere enjoyed the beanbags rather than tables and chairs 
Neda E,2 contributions,Mar 2017,This beach was beautiful and jam packed with restaurants and activities.The Unfortunate Issue was Rubbish every where
Emily H,7 contributions,Jan 2017,This beach was beautiful and jam packed with resturants and activities but there was ALOT of rubbish scattered around the beach which was sad to see. The water was very dirty but it had lovely views. A once in a lifetime view.
Andrina M,10 contributions,Mar 2017,"There's a sign before the beach letting us know it's ""garbage season"" at seminyak beach from December to April. It wasn't swimmable when we went, there was so much garbage floating around. I would give it a miss during this time of year, there are much nicer beaches around Bali to enjoy."
NehaVerma1987,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,Very Clean beach with good sand and less number of tourists. Nice place to spend and enjoy a day.Near to bog and famour reaorts and villas.
Jordan D,23 contributions,Apr 2017,During the period I was in Seminyak the wind blew all the rubbish and waste onshore. Leaving the beaches littered and the sea dirty. I'm used to seeing this while traveling and unfortunately a reality of the way in which plastic is dealt with in this part of the world. 
lynne l,United Kingdom,Mar 2017,"Go to NusaThere is a little shop in Seminyak ,looks nothing. but makes the most fafulous coconut ice cream . You must try it"
cambridgetravller,"Cambridge, UK",Mar 2017,"Unfortunately, I agree with all the negative reviews.  We were staying at  a very good hotel which was sea front and they cleaned the front of the hotel's part of the beach every day so was not responsible for the rest.  The few times we walked we did see a dead dog and dog walkers would let their dogs foul and not pick up after them, so pretty disgusting. The GM of the hotel said that the Government are responsible and as they really don't care a fig as you can see from the rubbish on the beach as well as the streets, that the Government is not exactly ""Green""."
Khaled N,18 contributions,Mar 2017,"The ebach is amazing by sunset, its not recomended for swimming, rather surfing and hanging around there is cool, alot of nice places to dine and drink along the beach"
19flyer91,"Manchester, UK",Apr 2017,"We went to Seminyak for a few days in April and we found the beach to be pretty dirty with litter, broken glass etc all over the sand, not just in 1 area but the 2 or so miles we walked along. The sea was also very brown in some areas. There are much much nicer beaches in other areas of Bali. "
Japan1980,"Las Vegas, NV",Feb 2017,"I was expected to see a beautiful beach in Seminyak but was a big disappointed to see a lot of garbage on the beach like plastic bags,plastic wrapped and cans. The waves are very high, not able to swim either. Black sand not a problem if the beach is clean. I would say Nusa Dua beach more beautiful, cleanest and quiet than Seminyak beach. "
CMAX2012,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Perhaps living in Australia with its pristine beaches has spoiled us, but I wouldn't even walk on those carbage strewn places you don't know what's buried , there's no excuse for the dirt there, it is only slightly better than Kuta beach. Bali needs to sort its beaches out to bring them up to a family friendly status."
Ali P,11 contributions,Mar 2017,"High waves. Not suitable for swimming but good for surfing. Water was not clean. We saw things like plastic bags and candy rapers floating in the water.Lots of people walking around  trying to sell you bracelets, glasses, bows, paintings ... etc.Lots of restaurants and shops around. If you are looking for a busy beach this is for you. If you want peace and crystal clear waters then this is not the best option."
Lyle K,"Sarasota, FL",Apr 2017,"On a recent visit to this Beach I was astonished at how dirty the beach was. I'm mean this is Bali. I understand that the tide brings in trash everyday, but this wasn't overnight garbage.  I travel the world and even in the poorest countries I have never seen anything like this before. If all the restaurants would just take care of their portion then the beach would be more attractive for all..."
Donald G,"Louisville, KY",Apr 2017,"Dirty, lots of trash but warm water and good time.  We went to a surf school and we all caught a few waves. "
Robert G,24 contributions,Apr 2017,"Two ""streams"" ran from busy town into the sea. it did not smell very nice and put us off the sea. Sea was rough and Red flags up so again not as good as many other beaches I have been to."
PeterMM3,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2017,"Very dirty beach, lots of rubbish and discoloured water. Parts of the each covered in brown/green sludge and general garbage everywhere."
Dana G,6 contributions,Apr 2017,This beach is raved about and I don't know why! It was so dirty on the beach and there was so much rubbish in the water. Most of the restaurants on the beach were quite run down. Lots of people offering you to buy different accessories/paintings/toys. This beach definitely needs a clean up! Will not revisit and would not recommend to others. 
KAYRA,OXFORD UK,Mar 2017,"Our hotel was a few mins walk from Seminyak beach.... It's wide and waves are huge .... You get a variety of bars and restaurants to choose from.... It's nicer and calmer than Kuta Beach ....In the evenings there were loads of lanterns lights lit up and big bonfire in front of some restaurants.... Lovely atmosphere...Nice stroll and amazing sunset as it's anywhere else in Bali ....You watch people riding horses or walking , surfing .... We didn't dare to go in to the sea as it looked very scary and waves were big .... But beautiful all the same .... If you keep walking then you reach the much busier Kuta beach ... More going on there .... The reason for a 4 star rating is the sewerage smell and the rubbish .... Probably coming from the hotels we don't know ... Bali and its beaches are definitely worth a visit... "
Jennifer R,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,I'm not sure where some of these other reviewers went but in early April 2017 there was simply not much beach left. Waves crashed right up to the restaurants and it was virtually impossible to walk along the beach! There was a larger amount of dirty grey sand near the temple which was full of rubbish and dogs. The lesson I repeatedly learn is that if I want white pristine beaches I should just stay at home ( Australia ) Make sure you book a place with a pool 
David L,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,One of the nicer stretches of beach near Kuta. A number of nice hotels and restaraunts along here to choose from. Beach was clean and on some days the surf was excellent. 
Margaret19606,"Texas Gulf Coast, TX",Mar 2017,We spent our time in the hotel pool which overlooked the beach.  The beech is sandy and clean and lovely for a stroll in the evening.
ToniaH3,147 contributions,Apr 2017,"We went down to watch the sunset .Lovely time of night with lots of people around to watch. Seats, drinks, food also available along the beach."
fionji,Milano,Jun 2016,"We stayed in Seminyak during our holiday and would often come here in the mornings to enjoy the sun. Plenty of space on the beach, there are some great food stalls all along."
NickPay,"Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"Walk along Seminyak beach, enjoy the sunset and take in the energy of this beautiful beach.Try one of the beachfront restaurants and eat dinner as the sun sets over the sea."
Kate O,"Los Angeles, CA",Mar 2017,"After traveling all over Bali and Lombok and seeing some really beautiful beaches, this one wasn't really that impressive. I was happy to see the water and get my feet in the sand but it wasn't pristine or calming. If you're looking for a really nice beach, try heading away from the city a little."
Ceri E,"Bristol, UK",Mar 2017,"Before we went to Bali i done research on the local beaches and a large percentage of the reviews were not great so we were not surprised when we arrived to see it full of rubbish and not really inviting, it's worth a visit to say you've seen it as it's only a 15 minute walk from the centre of Seminyak or 5 minutes in a taxi 30,000 one way...What I would recommend is to hire a cab to take you to some beaches as there's no local transport if you want to spend a day hanging out at the beach..."
ennasila6,14 contributions,Mar 2017,"Dinner on the beach, watching the sun go down, followed by fireworks and Balinese dancing....can't be beaten!"
larrym0527,"Camas, Washington",Mar 2017,"Wonderful beach, litteraly just on the edge of the city... Great beach walk.  The sunsets are the best in the world.  We were lucky to watch a fantastic lightening show over the Indian Ocean at sunset.  Fantastic does not begin to describe."
Rschagrin,"Delray Beach, FL",Mar 2017,A public beach on the Indian Ocean. Very soft grey sand. You can rent chairs and umbrellas. It is pretty wide.
Joon,"Los Angeles, CA",Mar 2017,"I went down to Seminyak Beach for the first time expecting a beach of paradise. What I saw instead was a beach full of trash, stray dogs running around, some brown water in the beach and some red flags that's telling you not to go into the water. Trash. That's what I felt as I was walking around in the water and on the beach. There are lot of TRASH. I couldn't stand in the water for a minute without some kind of trash touching my feet. Wrappers, Cloths, or whatever. Trash. Now I come from Los Angeles where there are a lot of people that go in the water and has commercial businesses all around. Even LA beaches felt it was cleaner and more sanitary than here. I couldn't believe all the amount of trash floating in the water and debris on the beach. I thought this was supposed to be a paradise, instead it felt like where all the trash ended up. Granted some of them could be from Bali and some of them could be from elsewhere just washing up here. Regardless, it felt dirty just standing in the water with the damn trash touching my feet every 10 seconds or so!I saw some brown water and thought it was weird that the water was so brown. Not all parts but some parts. I asked around why the water was brown and no one knew. Also there were red flags all around and when I asked around, people were saying because the wind was strong and that you could get sucked out to the ocean due to fast & strong current. Also there are apparently whirlpools that will suck you in. That's a scary thought. I've also seen some stray dogs running around. One time I saw a pack of 5 dogs all playing with each other on the beach. Sure that sounds cute except when you come to realize that some of these dogs could have rabies, probably had no owners, and that they were playing in the beach where people were. I'm sure the dogs don't think about where to pee and poop. I'm from USA where there are regulations against dogs on the beach due to them crapping and peeing which contaminates the water. In Seminyak I've seen a lot of stray dogs around which didn't help the feeling I got about the hygiene and cleanliness of the water. The water was very warm. That was one plus about the beach. With the clouds far away and the sandy beach all around, this was a plus. There weren't that many pluses given I've also been to beaches in Thailand which were freakin Awesome."
842colin,"Bournemouth, UK",Mar 2017,"I have travelled for many years and can honestly say l have never seen so much rubbish on a beach. even when you enter the water you are walking in floating plastic and any other form of garbage. The locals are only interested in selling you over priced drinks, or renting you a board for 4 times the price you would pay 5 mins walk away to a side street shop. They are not interested in your comfort if you don't want to lie on the dirty beaches of kuta ,legion or Seminyak you can rent an over priced sun bed."
Peter_Mogensen,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Mar 2017,"This could be the most fantastic place. The view is absolutely stunning, not only at sunset but also during the day.Sadly all the garbage and rubbish from the ocean is just lying there in the sand - spoiling the beach."
Jessi-leigh B,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,Massages tickCold drinks tickBeautiful sunsets tickFriendly people tick This place has it all! 3rd time visiting I will 110% be back.. have added bars and restaurants we visited 
Sally F,"Brighton, UK",Mar 2017,"After having travelled across South east Asia our expectations for Bali beaches were high. Sorry to say we were disappointed except for Seminyak Beach. It was the only one that is being actively kept clean. Only thing is the locals will try to sting you for the sun loungers. We paid 100,000 (¬£6.00 approximately) for 2 beds for 4 hours. I think we overpaid. He originally wanted 200,000. "
Paulinha,"County Dublin, Ireland",Mar 2017,"The sand is black and water is not clear, but this is not the issue. If you don't want to lie on the rubbish, avoid this beach. "
Katie M,"Aberdeen, UK",Mar 2017,"Perhaps ignorance and lack of research on our part, but the beach itself is dirty, covered with dog's mess and has extremely strong currents. So if you're looking for a romantic stroll and dip in the Ocean, prepare to be disappointed! "
Priyanka Kwatra,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2017,"Great restaurants and shacks are located on the beach which get crowded during sunset. You can surf, take a horse ride and enjoy your drinks and food here. Kids love it. A bit dirty though.."
ShahBulgaria,"Varna, Varna, Bulgaria",Mar 2017,Bali is a place known for surfing and so the tides are harsh for swimmers... so swimmers be careful... for the people and families who want to enjoy the holiday on the beach please take your rubbish with you as you can see many people like you left their rubbish there... When I say people like you I mean humans so do not get offended and try to keep a larger clean vision in life
MaryAnnPerth,Perth,Mar 2017,The first night we went there was great buzz on the beach. A few nights later it was weird. And if you're looking for snow white sand forget it.  There are enough restaurants and bars to find something to keep most people happy. 
Delhibelly0410E,"Edmonton, Canada",Mar 2017,Very sad to see so much plastic and garbage on the beach and in the water. Not pleasant to have plastic wrap around your legs when you go swimming. Locals claim it comes from the sea but it's being washed out from the streets every time it rains. Bali is choking under the weight of its own success. A pity to see it now compared to when I was there in 1974. Very sad!!
Torben,20 contributions,Mar 2017,"We were quite disappointed by the amount of trash at the beach. We just did a beach walk from Seminyak down to Legian. We wouldn't go here with our kids, not even on our own. It's sad to see places like this ruined by garbage."
Nariman E,31 contributions,Mar 2017,"Overall nice, with the exception of 'beach' vendors and 'brownish' water at places. Lots of sunscreen recommended though, sun is tricky and you can easily get burnt."
Roland D,"London, UK",Mar 2017,"The beach was not crowded and the water was lovely and warm.  But the waves meant it was not easy to swim.  And the water had a greenish-brown tinge.  I wondered where the sewerage is discharged from all the local hotels...   There are places along the shore to buy drinks, food and to rent sun beds.  "
Jon S,"Fremantle, Australia",Mar 2017,This beach is seriously filthy - full of discarded rubbish and an open sewer runs out to the ocean - which stinks. I would not swim or surf at this beach. This needs closing and a serious clean up.
Rajat A,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",Apr 2016,Lovely beach and amazing atmosphere. plenty of eateries around and you can do several water activities. Overall a must visit place for couples of families alike.
Roger W,"Bristol, UK",Mar 2017,"Beautiful long golden sandy beach. It's kept clean & tidy. Varied selection of beach bars & cafes spilling onto the beach - music can be annoying! Get the usual beach sellers, all licensed but they are persistent! Plenty of surfing etc. Really great beach."
Arve K,"Southern Norway, Norway",Mar 2017,"We visited this beach on 20. March, a sunny warm day in Bali. We sat for 2 hours in a restaurant with spectacular view of the beach. A nice and mild breeze made our time there enjoyable and outstanding. I reccommend a visit at Seminyak Beach!"
Sherri A,"London, England, United Kingdom",Mar 2017,"Average beach, very dirty. Full of expensive sun loungers with nowhere to lie on the sand. Also there are so many people trying to sell you things every two minutes, who do not take no for an answer - spoiled our overall experience here"
Reza K,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2017,"It was not clean enough and you cant find white sands, full of girls who looking for business!! May be not good for families."
Martin C,3 contributions,Mar 2017,We were there after a stom so there is rubish all over the beach so we didn't swim the people who sell on the beach are a little bit anoring but after you get use to that its a wonderful place with food and drinks even were your choice we and what you do the chiars on the beach are of rent so if you don't mind playing a little money you can sit on the beach and get a massage  it really wonderful way to spend time 
Deeana_L,"Ubud, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"I love swimming on this beach in the morning, when there are still less people there... This beach has a nice wave and many surfers like it too. Seminyak beach is one of the best places to see sunset in Bali so no wonder if this place is always full around that time..."
Khatleen M,Curepipe,Mar 2017,"Pretty good place to chill at sunset and to eat in the evening with lots of restos lining up the beach till Double Six. With their nice colourful umbrellas, it's quite a sight."
Shanu D,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2016,I feel the beaches at Kuta and Legian were more happening than the seminyak beach! The water was also pretty sandy and sticky! 
philjanal,13 contributions,Mar 2017,"Nice big beaches, first look awesome but rubbish everywhere on beach, storm water from streets run straight in "
Dieter B,"Redland City, Australia",Mar 2017,"This beach can have a lot of litter washed up each morning, but it is cleaned each morning. Lots of people walk this beach each morning for exercise. This is easy to do especially when the tide is out. Good for swimming and surfing , but look out for the strong current when the waves wash back out"
282Tourist,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2017,"Perfect for a morning or evening walk,  Not much of a swimming beach since the waves are very high ans strong so mostly for surfers.  It looked fgairly clean but seeing two dogs defecating in the beach was not something I wanted to see.  The evenings were great just relaxing and watching the beautiful sunsets."
ShawnD2010,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2017,"nice to walk along at sunset and listen to the music from the various beachside bars, very relaxing part of bali"
Shaiful_Noh,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2017,Cleanliness is an issue here. The sunset was good although it is not a white sandy beach but can always try to end a day here renting a sand bag sipping some mocktails and ice-cream with the kid.
Jessie,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beach itself is relatively clean, with a nice view. On super hot days there was an oder - I suspect from the rubbish behind the restaurants along the beach front. It was quite unpleasant and we could not stay long. Would recommend going at sunset/night as it's a bit cooler and the lanterns that are put up make for a very nice view. "
ahadley2017,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,I thought this beach was stunning especially in the early morning when there are less people and at sunset when there are stunning sunsets over the water. A lot of rubbish washes up on this beach but I've been told that's seasonal and there were people cleaning the beach in the early morning.
Lilypad P,"London, UK",Mar 2017,Go to Seminyak for the sunset views at one of the beach bars as they are priceless. Unfortunately there is just far too much litter on the beach that makes the sand look horrible.
Mj_phill,"Greater Perth, Australia",Mar 2017,Beach is not as clean but the sunsets are perfect and not crowded like the ones in Kuta. Stop off at ku da tah. Potato head or the Alila for drinks 
PJD1978,swansea,Mar 2017,"We would rock up at this beach at the end of a long hot day, and just grab a bean bag in one of the many beach bars and watch the sunset. It's a beautiful setting and so relaxing. The one issue is in some parts there is some mess and waste, this could easily be cleaned up by the local government each night."
reetsb27,40 contributions,Mar 2017,"We were here in March 2017 and the beach was quite clean. We were lucky to be staying at Alila with an Ocean view room so it was great waking up to see locals and tourist having morning walks and having fun. From Alila, we walked along the beach front to Kuta which didn't take long (prob shorter than a taxi ride!) and we also walked in the opposite direction towards Canggu. On our walks we discovered a few local bars (no hype type...) on beach front, so take some Rp with you for a quick stop and support the locals."
kyliesteward,"Cleveland, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beach is rather dirty but since we have come back it has improved a fair bit and they are doing dinners and drinks along the beach, more festive to go at night"
Brigitte T,"Deepwater, Australia",Mar 2017,"Presently at Alila --Seminyak. The beach is fabulous here, you just step down a few steps and you're there.from Courtyard it's about 300 m to the beach, too overcrowded I feel."
catrina p,"Jaco, Costa Rica",Mar 2017,"Unfortunately with current beach covered in pollution, they did have signs up apologizing for it, effort was been made to clean it up! Water was warm rough, great for surfing, unfortunately no swimming was permitted during the week 1 was there signs everywhere! "
Emma A,11 contributions,Mar 2017,Coming from South Africa with our beautiful white sand beaches it has been quite a shock to see so much litter in the ocean. It makes me feel really sad. We are lucky enough to be doing a home exchange and staying at the 5 star Anantura Hotel right on the beach so we just swim in the pool here. It's a great wave for beginners to learn to surf though and my boyfriend had such fun while I taught him on a long board we rented for R50 an hour right in front of our hotel on the beach. Haggle the price of board rentals with the locals so they don't rip you off! 
nvsa008,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2017,The beach was safe and hassle free. neat small waves to body surf. Nobody was in the water until the three of us went in and about 10 followed. They all appeared to be having a great time body surfing.
saf16,"Ettalong Beach, Australia",Feb 2017,Did not like Seminyak beach the sand was black & in certain areas it was smelly due to some outlets running from the streets through to the beach. 
Camila S,"Curitiba, PR",Mar 2017,"Nice beach if you want to chill and have drinks with friends!It gets pretty crowded, since most beaches around have reefs and stones, and this is a sand beach, but it's still niceGood sunset view Unfortunately, many garbage left at the beach, like most places in Bali "
LukeE1978,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beautiful relaxing place to visit. Food, drinks, entertainment right there, no need to wander any further!"
Darren C,"Edinburgh, UK",Mar 2017,"A visit to Seminyak beach is not relaxing. There is rubbish everywhere, dogs running about and doing the toilet in the ocean. You are harassed constantly from not only the deck chair men but also kids trying to sell bracelets, and other people selling watches and sunglasses. You get touched often by women trying to offer manicures and pedicures and massages!! To top it all off, we watched a women remove her baby's dirty nappy, wash the kid in the sea and then bury the nappy in the sand, 50m in front of us!!!!Not exactly tranquil or picturesque! "
abbyh86,"Inverell, Australia",Mar 2017,"Great atmosphere, dirty beach. Be prepared for people wanting to sell you anything and everything. Live music and drinks were great. "
mindy4715,"Fort Wayne, IN",Mar 2017,"This beach was closest to our hotel - within walking distance but it is poorly maintained.  Outside showers were turned off, so there was no way to rinse the sand off.  No other facilities available."
Parvesh S,"Leicester, UK",Dec 2016,Not sure what I can say about a beach butt he only reason it doesn't get 5/5 is because it can get a bit busy and can be a bit annoying with people always trying to sell you stuff.
BradfromSydney,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2017,The beach was filthy and covered in rubbish. Stray dogs all over the place and lots of dog poop. The weather wasn't particularly good either but the overall cleanliness left a lot to be desired.
FunkyMarshmallow,"Bournemouth, UK",Mar 2017,"This is one of the most disgustingly dirty beaches I have ever seen and I have travelled. The amount of rubbish washed up on the beach and not cleared away is a disgrace and an example of the crisis our oceans are suffering.  Why anyone would want to come and sit on it and look out at the rubbish is beyond me and why any Aussie would come from the beautiful beaches in Australia to surf here is crazy.  I went for an early morning run and had to wash my trainers after because I ran through the streams that led into the sea, the smell was so bad, god knows what is in that water and now in the sea."
dru d,4 contributions,Feb 2017,"So far, it's clean n nice to chill n relax.. $10 for pair of seats plus free coconut drink.. Well, sit back n enjoy the view.. üëôüòé"

Jenry D,"Klotten, Germany",Feb 2017,"Beautiful Beach, but it was kinda dirty. A lot of Plastic rubbish on the beach. Maybe it was very very bad Weather for 4 days. But I hope they will clean it. On Sunday was very crowded, many local people as well, they played football on the beach. Otherwise we love the beach."
Priyanka C,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Feb 2017,Good to hang out from morning to dusk. Sip in some really good beverages or try out some awesome dishes while relaxing at the beach from the numerous restaurants present there !
Danielevario,"Marina di Carrara, Italy",Jul 2016,"I've been in Bali in july 2016 and i think i'll return there next year! Amazing island, amazing people, gorgeous foodüòç"
Jamie C,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2017,"Whenever we go out for a meal we try to make it back to our hotel via the beach.As others have mentioned, there is a fair bit of rubbish that washes up which is a shame, so you need to be careful of where you tread at times.Seminyak Beach has vast expanses of sand and is very flat so a great beach for walking.We sat outside Ku De Ta so we could hear the music and relax while the sun went down.Others were sitting on a picnic blanket with a bottle of wine doing the same.Sunset draws a huge crowd but there is plenty of room for everyone."
kokolig,Los Angeles,Jan 2017,It's generally a dirty beach but has some of the best sunsets on earth.  You could stroll onto some famous beach clubs and enjoy the music and crowds.
Hasry WirAmici,12 contributions,Feb 2017,Perfect place to chill with your love ones whilst watching the sunset. Clean beach with soft white sand.
dorinka n,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Mar 2017,"For me the ocean always had a soothing effect on my mood. At Seminyak beach, you have endless stretches of beach for your toes to hug. If surfing is your thing, then the long breakers will be the stuff that dreams are made off."
KerryJane65,Perth,Jan 2017,"Stunning setting spoilt by plastic plastic and more plastic.  Where does it come from?  Bali needs to get a strict eco friendly program - like Rowanda. The beaches in front of Potato Head,  Semaya, Ku De Ta ect are clean. "
Christanf,"Dudley, UK",Feb 2017,Mile upon mile as far as my eyes could see top $ beach and awesome sunset bars on front rip off as usual drink lots and lots of water and then drink some more 
sahil a,22 contributions,Feb 2017,I went early in the morning on a weekday..Bt I cudnt find anything interesting..It's not that clean also..It's good if u just wanna jog Nd enjoy the silence..The climate of bali is hot Nd the sun cums out fast so I would recommend to try another beaches like Kuta Beach or jimbaran..
Simon G,"Toulouse, France",Sep 2016,"One of my favorite beach in Bali, great for chilling and enjoying the sunset, but you can also surf or swim"
Eka P,35 contributions,Feb 2017,Spiritually centre position next to Petitengit pura near this beach. Great place to have a cocktail and watch the sun go down at La Lucciola. 
Paul M,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2017,Prices are a little more expensive for beach chairs but you pay for cleanliness and less of a crowd. Surf is great if 5ft swell or better from low to mid tide with long running lefts and rights. Great for sunset surf with kudeta playing chill out house music in the background. 
Anniemaykay,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,Maybe we went the wrong time of year?? Beach was dirty and not somewhere I'd like to swim. Better beaches in Australia.
ClaireT79,"Phuket, Thailand",Feb 2017,Really dirty beach. My husband surfed here and said the waves were good but not so fun wadding out in plastic and rubbish. If you like beaches on your holiday do not go to this side of Bali in rainy season go East
Michael C,182 contributions,Nov 2016,"We found this beach to be one of the nicest during our time in Bali.Its not as hectic as the others but yet still boasting lots of local character, the bars are rather more upmarket but yet you can still find the odd local hideaway thats well worth the find so its a lovely blend of local to luxurious.The good thing we loved was that your not as bothered by all the beach sellers as you are on other beaches and also the sellers here are a lot more chilled."
janetcF1052UJ,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"We loved this beach and it holds many fond memories for us. I especially loved it early in the morning when the stall holders and cafes were setting up.  The various fishermen with their long casting rods were a curious sight amongst the surfers, yet this amazing beach could accommodate us all!  "
SynNetwork,"Las Vegas, NV",Feb 2017,"Beach was nice, but had a bunch of signs up for No swimming.  Only for surfers or sun bathing.  Sun is very strong, apply plenty lotion. "
JDandHK,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Feb 2017,You can't ignore the trash on the beach and the black coloured sand that's originated from volcanics.The beach was not attractive and I haven't found one redeeming feature of Bali that would get me back.
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2017,We have been to most of the beaches around here and this is our favourite. It is probably the cleanest and has lots to do to keep you occupied through the day.Many places rent sun bed and umbrellas quite cheaply and some restaurants even allow you to use their bean bags for free as long as you give them your custom. There are lots of bars and restaurants in the area and also lots of beach traders. The sand  itself is generally of good quality and you can use the beach to either relax or undertake more strenuous activities. There is lots of surfing and we used to do long beach walks. 
Cherie P,"Leongatha, Australia",Feb 2017,Went for a wander down to the beach last night and got the shock of my life. There where hundreds of beanbags and people sitting watching the sun set it was amazing. Restaurants all the way along with very friendly staff and great service. Bands played the whole time we were there. Definitely a must to do at night while on Seminyak 
Sal,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,"What fabulous sunsets! And what blue water during the day! Sadly, parts of the beach are littered with rubbish. But the other parts are very clean. The beach has black sand.At the time we went during the day, a swim was out of the question due to the red warning flags, as the sea was rough, but am sure it is a pleasant enough sea to swim in."
BeaBC,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2017,"There were gorgeous beaches, and others that were not so nice. The part in behind the Oberoi Hotel and Ku De Ta was fabulous. I even got a chair and a massage on the beach there. "
rowanc932,33 contributions,Feb 2017,"Walked down to this beach which took about half an hour from the main road, a little bit of a walk but it was nice. As soon as we got there I went in for a swim which was good. The beach was a little bit smelly and quite a bit of rubbish around which was a bit disappointing. It is a really rough beach so be careful swimming here!! I would recommend checking out the sunset here tho "
Chicco_Bp,"Budapest, Hungary",Dec 2016,"Not the best beach i have ever seen, but cozy, hot and dark sand.Don't wait Seychelle-like place but enjoy the different type:)"
Susannah L,14 contributions,Feb 2017,"Although friends had warned me about this beach..I wasn't prepared for how much rubbish was in the water/being washed ashore. It was pretty disturbing. I won't be back for swimming, except to help on beach clean up days."
Camila Toth,"Sao Caetano do Sul, SP",Feb 2017,"Personally I don't really like the beaches here in Bali, all beaches are dirty , no expected beautiful beaches around Bali! Near our hotel there was a sewer! Not really good to see! Ok, all sunset are really amazing ! If u wanted to see the culture , ok! People here are so king and happy ! "
David F,rotherham,Feb 2017,"I have seem cleaner landfill sites!!!Sort it out Bali, its not good for tourism, the environment or anything else for that matter."
Feodora M,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2017,This is a nice beach with a lot of beachclubs but there are so many tourists and the sea and sand is not that esthetically pleasing as other beaches in Bali
MissLadyBB,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,"The beach is beautiful, there are waves, surfers, lots of locals selling goods, beach bars with bean bags, good food and drinks. It's not too busy, and you can walk to everywhere. "
MrAndMrsKennedy,"Los Angeles, CA",Dec 2016,"I'll believe it when I see it, but I can't imagine there ever being a nice time to visit this beach. We were there in December and it was covered in trash. You couldn't walk on the beach, let alone fathom going in the water. AVOID in December!!"
viktorija,"Hvar, Croatia",Jan 2017,"Beach and sea are so dirty, i was afraid to go swimming because of so much garbage. Only nice thing are sunsets"
Chris C,"Honolulu, HI",Feb 2017,"Not a fan of the beach here. It is a very gritty and crunchy sand. Not good to walk in. They attempt to keep it clean and in the mornings it is mostly okay, but when the tide comes in so does all of the trash. It becomes like a dump site. I don't know how anyone walks on this beach barefoot, especially in the evenings. It is really disappointing and a bit alarming."
Mari_Star_Kitty,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,"The beach in Seminyak is a hive of activity with surfing lessons, food and drinks, shopping (traveling sales people) swimming, sun bathing and a range of activities and entertainment.Beautiful dark sand that is extremely fine, with a sparkling element to it.A nice place to spend the day.Enjoy."
Linsog,19 contributions,Feb 2017,There were a lot of trash on the beach. Might have been because of the rain season? There were also a red flag up so we didn't try to swim. 
kyrajc,"Vancouver, Canada",Feb 2017,The hype is totally justified! Try anything and it will be amazing. I LOVED the pancakes! Staff is awesome!
Al_Subi,35 contributions,Feb 2017,"I visites this beach in Feb 2017. I know that Seminyak beach is known for its magnificent sunsets. This fame is teuly well-deserved. Enjoying the sunset while relaxing in one of the beach side clubs and restaurants, or strolling on the beach while admiring how the sky slowly transformed from blue to orange to black here is truly a great experience."
Geet,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,I visited the beach late evening so didnt quiet enjoy the sunny beach. However it was nice and calm for a pleasant walk and to while away one of your evenings if you have EXTRA TIME
foongherili,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2017,"Enjoyed a slow barefooted walk from Seminyak beach all the way to Kuta. Took about 1.5hours in the evening. The sun was a little scotching but the view was magnificent. The beach was quiet (at Seminyak end) and picturesque. Went we were at Kuta beach, the sun was setting and it was perfect to take in a moment to marvel at the wonders of nature and how fortunate were we to enjoy a holiday.We got a little sunburned after the walk though.. so 10/10 would recommend sunblock. :p "
DP710,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,"You do not go to Seminyak for the beach. It's dirty and very rough, stick to the poolside here and head to Nusa Dua or other areas for a nicer beach experience."
anita_02_2017,"Zhenjiang, China",Feb 2017,"It was a dirty beach. Drinks are kind of expensive for it's location. One of the positives is that there are plenty of people to learn to surf from! And when people come up to you to sell you stuff, they'll usually leave you alone after a simple no. "
Violet F,4 contributions,Feb 2017,The only good thing about this beach is the sunset. I would not swim there personally. There is a good market at the back with many bars and restaurants to chose from to watch the sunset with a drink in hand.!
SUEBIDOUX,"Terrebonne, Canada",Feb 2017,"Great clean beach but very load music everywhere as well as beach vendors trying to sell their stuff and trying and trying again,the same came around at least 3 times...but still great big beach and lively sunset.would not spend one week here but for a couple of days,great beach ambiance!"
David F,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2017,"Seminyak beach is beautiful, stretching for kilometers. Great for walking, surfing (body, bogey board and just surfboard), and taking amazing photographs of Bali Beach Life and, of course, beautiful sunsets. It is also lined with some amazing places to eat and sleep (see my other reviews for Seminyak) which are perfect for a drink, a meal or just  enjoying the almost nightly beautiful sunsets. This would be a five star beach except for two, or three caveats. One is that alot of people have dogs in Bali and bring them on the beach. Which means if you like to walk barefoot on the beach, like I do, then you need to pay extra attention that you don't step into a fresh dog droppings. Two is that at various points along the beach there are effluents from various parts of town. This is raw sewage. I either walk out in the surf to cross them or just turn around and walk the other way. Needless to say, you don't want to be swimming directly offshore, or down current unless you've had all your shots!;) Thirdly is a new hazard which I only noticed on this last trip, which is broken shards of glass from beer bottles. The ones I spotted at low tide were in the shallow water and constantly being covered and uncovered by the trailing surf. I made a mental note to myself to pack my white water sandals next time I come. It's really a shame that such a beautiful natural spot as Seminyak is being polluted in this way. But while the above hazards do detract from the water and beach activities they do not affect the absolutely amazing sunsets. "
jennyjenjen925,"Portland, OR",Feb 2017,"My dad and I strolled down to the beach right around sunset and caught a magnificent view. The beach is crowded with lots of activity but still beautiful. We enjoyed snapping pictures, walking around and then grabbing a drink and listening to live music as we watched it set. It might not be the best beach for swimming but the nightlife looked great and it was relatively clean (compared to other areas). Definitely not secluded - tons of tourists. "
Kim Maaike J,5 contributions,Feb 2017,The beach has an amazing sunset but because of the rain season the water is a little bit dirty and rough. I won't recommend swimming in this time a year. 
Errol S,"Forest Creek, Australia",Feb 2017,"I would loved to have swum at this beach but when I saw what washed up, I couldn't. If what you can see is bad, what about what you can't see? It's still bussing with people and activity however and has a great atmosphere but swimmers were noticeably absent. They do keep sweeping it up but they really need to address the source of the problem for the sake of tourism as well as nature. "
Rajat L,5 contributions,Feb 2017,The whole beachis a good visit if you are staying in that area. Nothing worth to be specially done from far off distances.It has few cafes on the beach which have Lazy Boys outside and you can sit and relay and enjoy few drinks while watching the sunset. They even have live bands playing in front of many Cafe's which are pretty decent for a lazy and relaxed evening.
Neenienoo,100 contributions,Feb 2017,It's a great place to sit watch the sunsetThe beach is dirty and full of rubbish if you get pass this it's a nice spot Lots of music lots of hagglers that drive you crazy The drinks are cheap but our cokes were hot 
AO-Melbourne,45 contributions,Jan 2017,Absolutely stunning beach. Great for a stroll or a jog. Nice way to view all the hotels with a beach front. However there is a lot of rubbish/debris all over the beach. I wouldn't swim in it. 
Colin J,"Vienna, Austria",Feb 2017,"Lovely long beachfront, would imagine this is a good place for surfers due to the amazing waves, relaxing just sitting there watching the waves. Top."
Carly_Grindall,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2017,Sad to see the beach littered with rubbish that's been washed up or just dumped by people who don't care. The sand is dirty and it's certainly not a beach I would want to swim in. 
Emma G,24 contributions,Feb 2017,"We were disappointed with how dirty it was but found really good restaurants along the beach. Since seminyak is pretty expensive going to a eating on the beach is a good option and you get a great view. Coconuts are 20k and we found great food for 30k. If you like vegan food a place called spicy coconut is worth a visit, just a 5 minute walk off the beach (north part of the beach, near canggu)."
–¢–∏–º—É—Ä –£,11 contributions,Feb 2017,"It has a picturesque sunset!!! Thera are a lot of bars and cafes with wifi along the beach area. Waves are large, so it's good for surfing. "
technomumBrisbane,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2017,"Beach was very dirty with a lot of debris washing in from recent rain.  However, an attendant was collecting it for disposal.  There are plenty of lounge chairs for hire on the each and a life guard is in attendance.  I believe a beautiful sunset can be viewed from here but unfortunately it was overcast when I was there."
Toby Cheong,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,The beach has litter not cleared and a bit of smell due to them. It's not so clean and pleasant after all. Quite disappointing.
kristychef,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2017,"Cleaner than kuta, and great beach clubs to visit. Walked alone the beach for an hour or so, relaxing walk as you aren't hassled a lot by people trying to sell you stuff"
Barbara A,"Lakes Entrance, Australia",Feb 2017,"A panoramic beach, black sand, with many walkers. One can rent a sun lounge but do get some quotes before settling on the right one. Cafes are on the beach front. Overall has a nice feel."
ahujarj,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2016,"A very nice long clean stretch of beach, superb for a good run or even just a walk, If your a guest at SAMAYA u'll have the pleasure of chilling on the seaside lounger sipping iced water or a drink, its bliss‚Ä¶and those moments just stay with you..."
ambersal,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"Slightly better the monstrosity which is Kuta beach. Cleaner, but it is still nothing special. We found a small spot to sunbathe in but that's about it. The water was brown and the waves were strong, wouldn't recommend for kids "
wayneNkris,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2017,"Went for a walk along the beach at Seminyak for about 45 minutes and we were saddened to see the amount of rubbish washed up on the shoreline. Considering the beaches on Bali are the main attraction, I believe that a lot more should be done to clean them up and keep them clean. There were literally thousands of plastic bags, drinking straws, cigarette lighters and innumerable other items that just should not belong on a beach.One can only be saddened to think of what this rubbish, particularly the plastic bags, is doing to the sea life.Please Bali - Clean up your act!"
Ben T,14 contributions,Feb 2017,Waiters don't give your change expect it as a tip. Often price of bill different from original order from menu. Food not as ordered and undercooked
MBCCritics,33 contributions,Feb 2017,"All the rubbish being washed up on the shore. There were cleaners but still very dirty. Don't dare to go into the sea, just got some tanning. Worse part was the oily water."
Soraya2404,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jan 2017,"Was disappointed when i eventually made it to the beach. Litter was strewn throughout the beach and I literally had to watch my step. My hopes of catching a tan on the beach was shattered. Could just be that i visited the wrong time of year, but should i visit bali again, Nasu Dua would def be my choice."
snowieWales,Wales,Dec 2016,walked out onto the beach and was shocked by the level of rubbish on it.  One woman trying to sweep it all into piles.  Not somewhere I would like to spend my holiday.
wpcheah,"Lucerne, Switzerland",Feb 2017,"Human footprints everywhere, besides that overall it's a great beach. Powerful waves ideal for surfing"
Taipei921,Singapore,Jan 2017,"Wide expanse of endless beach, shared by many hotels dotting the whole strip of beach. The waves are excellent for surfers but perhaps it was this time of the year, that the sea seems to churn up the muddy sandbed and cause the pristine blue water to turn brownish as the waves washes ashore, exposing the filth and plastics along the beach. It is otherwise lovely, and a great place for enjoying the sun and the natural sea breeze. When the sun sets, the afterglow of the setting sun is reflected off the freshly rolled back beach, the contrast and shilouette views makes for perfect sunset photography and sights."
Jeff A,25 contributions,Jan 2017,"Garbage in the water, garbage on the beach and sewage in the streams heading to the ocean. Seminyak is a cool place to visit but if the beach is your focus go elsewhere."
Nikoli D,21 contributions,Feb 2017,Beaches was filled with trash. Very disappointed. Beach had solicitors. No public bathrooms. Not worth going to don't waste your time and money.
Walter_Beijing,"Beijing, China",Feb 2017,"Never saw the beach from Kuta all the way to Seminyak beach and beyond in such a sad state. I loved to walk there for hours but what we saw there yesterday was a disaster:- plastic garbage strewn over the beach everywhere, not 10 meters without stepping on some garbage- those village canals bringing raw sewage to the beach offloading their smelly load into the waters.- brown foam and waves every few hundred meters when another canals lands on the beach- a permanent sewage smell in the air although it was a windy day- beach erosion is a big problem; the beach hotels are fortifying their beach line with cement. The stairs from their gardens to the beach has become one meter longer (Legian Hotel) since I have seen it 3 years ago.We were disgusted and did not go into the waters there. Our little son got a skin rash on legs and back from that sewage water.The government needs to act:- clean the canals- introduce effective waste management- stop corruptionThe hotels and tourist industry should step up to the government and demand environmental improvement!!!Good luck "
Dei G,"Cairns Region, Australia",Feb 2017,Absolutely  filthy with litterMouldy looking beanbags and piles of rubbish everywhere.Walked along to get a sense of the place but never even bothered going back
Mace H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"We arrived into Seminyak late on a Thursday and couldn't wait to see the beach on Wednesday morning. Given the time zone change we were up early so wondered down to the beach for a walk. We go there within 5 minutes but what we found was disappointing. It was low tide and all manner of garbage was washed up and the ocean was brown. There were mane workers sweeping/raking up the mess given the many hotels that line the beach. Over the next week things didn't really improve although it was beautiful to listen to the waves at night. Seminyak is a wonderful place but the beach isn't the highlight. We didn't get to see any outstanding sunsets given cloud cover but what we did see was impressive and we had a wonderful anniversary at La lucciola. Also beware of time share workers posing as tourist officers asking your opinion, they get your hotel, your name and length of stay and then bombard you with phone calls. Not pleasant but our villa did a wonderful job at filtering these."
Gibbs T,6 contributions,Jan 2017,we went here for new years eve. while yes there was rubbish etc due to the high tides and it was crazy busy... there's heaps of amazing restaurants close by to sit back relax and watch the sunset. 
aneta k,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"Seminyak beach must be one of the worst beaches we've been on. It's filthy with rubbish everywhere. We walked all the way from chez gado gado restaurant to Potato head club and the whole stretch was dirty. Also, as you'd expect, it has heaps of locals trying to sell you things and although we understand they are trying to make a living, saying ""no, thank you"" every couple of minutes gets somehow tiring after a while...the dark volcanic sand doesn't help the situation and makes the beach look even dirtier. Water looks muddy and just like the beach is full of rubbish."
Brynell D,12 contributions,May 2016,"Seminyak is an upbeat part of Bali with a little something for everyone. Whether you're looking for relaxation and spirituality, or just a really fun bar run, Seminyak has something for you. Love the locals, some of the nicest people I've met. Also, Seminyak offered greater variety of cuisine and dining options than Kuta.You can have Indonesian streetfood or a five star Continental meal."
CaptUnmesh,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Nov 2016,We stayed at the Anatara Resort on the beach and took a stroll across the beach and it was splendid. We managed to walk for over a couple of miles without any hesitation or break. The beech is cleaner and nicer than the one at Kuta and lesser people come here. There are plenty of inexpensive places to dine on the beach and have a couple of beers. Worth spending time here than KUTA . 
Mike S,"Brighton, Australia",Dec 2016,"The beach was great. Although when they was a high tide or a storm a lot of rubbish was left on the beach, but there were crews cleaning it "
randomEX123,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,"The sunsets here are memorable. However, the plastic and garbage at the beach is sooo soo sad. One can only hope that at one stage cleaning this up becomes a priority (same as people stop dumping in it!). "
T4870,"Cairns, Australia",Jan 2017,"Could be such a beautiful beach and the sunsets are amazing. But the beach needs some care. So much rubbish, saw stray dogs pooping on the beach, plastic everywhere. Its unrelaxing how much you get bothered, especially if you walking along and they want to invite you to sit on the chairs and buy drinks. Gets a bit tiring. Such a shame as I bet the beach used to be pristine but tourism and laziness has now destroyed it. "
dendee2015,"Rochester, UK",Jan 2017,"So much rubbish on the beach, even though people trying to clean it up, but it was a no win situation."
trailblazer119,"Dallas, TX",Dec 2016,"I was stunned when I walked over to Seminyak Beach from my hotel, expecting to take a beautiful picture and instead found the beach covered in garbage.  There seemed to be a lot of clean up efforts going on, but it looked really dismal.  Shame on people for destroying such a beautiful place!"
beckyboo0012,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2017,"Spent an evening lounging in bean bags,  drinking a Bintang while watching the sunset, absolute paradise."
Michael A,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,It is not worth going to a place that admits it has a lot of plastic and nappies floating in its water.  Recently the army has been called out to clean up the beaches they have got so bad but we were there tow days later and they were still unacceptably filthy.  i love Balinese people but there are better places to go on holiday in Asia. People avoiding Bali belly who carefully avoid drinking the water and street eating are surprised when they get ill.  Well this is one of the answers.Time the government stopped milking the place and cleaned it up.
Gabriel11,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"We had never walked along the beach so we decided to catch the shuttle and walk to and along the beach. It was crowded, with several Beach Bars overlooking it. There is quite a lot of litter but I could see people cleaning up, which is good. The sea itself feels like river water. We enjoyed the walk and it reminded us of the past when we were assailed by hawkers who seemed to take rejection of goods personally."
Bob M,"Atlanta, GA",Jun 2016,This beach is so cool. So nice to hang out during the day. Very colorful bars and the waves are beautiful with a nice overspray.
azaferkoker,36 contributions,Jan 2017,Beach is so nice with high quality sand..ƒ∞ts more quite than Kuta&Legian beach..For resting and sunbath its one of the best in Bali..Lot of clubs and bars beside beach.Because of high wawes if not a good swimmer it have high risk for to swim..Prices more expensive than Legian and Kuta beach..
FengXueSG,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,"Seminyak beach offered great wave for surfing, splendid sunset view, easy access to restaurants and shops in Seminyak, and a chain of restaurants and bars along the beach. One problem is, there is a canal (looks like a sewage canal)near Jl Camplung Tanduk cutting through the beach, with piles of waste around the area. This makes the walk from Pura Petitenget to Double six beach (same for the reverse direction)     a little bit unpleasant."
Nino Boss,"Chicago, IL",Jan 2017,"Happy to embrace the Indian Ocean after staying inland for quite some time! I'm unsure if the rainy season has anything to do with it , however Seminyak Beach is completely filthy and dirty and although the sunsets were breath taking I very much enjoyed them from 707, W Hotel and Potato Head Beach Club  "
Dan M,Mongolia,Jan 2017,"By the time I got to Seminyak beach in the morning the day was already hot.  Waves were moderate, and the water looked brown with churned up sand.  I was surprised at the relatively low number of people there. In retrospect I would probably have gone there later in the day to watch the sunset, but had a very pleasant time on the sand nevertheless.  I plan to return."
jpc5166,"Shanghai, China",Jan 2017,This beach was not what I expected.  Since I'm from Florida west coast where we have pure white beaches and I read this beach was fantastic I expected more.  Anyways the waves were great for body surfing. There was a ton of trash floating up on the beach almost as if a barge full of trash had capsized.  And nobody was picking up trash. Maybe this was a one-off event. Not sure.  
MissTandi,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"I know it is not a good view of Seminyak beach during rainy season (Dec - Feb) as there was so many rubbish waved away to the beach. I believe our government has coordinated cleanliness department to keep the beach clean during rainy season...well, they have collected lots of rubbish every morning.Anyway, apart of rainy season...I love these beach"
Made Dodi - Private Driver Bali,"Kuta, Indonesia",Jan 2017,Seminyak beach is a great place for Surfing you will find a lot of Surfing Schools near by. Also there are a lot of nice Restaurants and bars as well as beach Clubs.
Chevaun J,"Chengdu, China",Jan 2017,"Long stretch of beach, however the sea is always rough and windy. Not much to do from my point of view but to chill and enjoy the sunset in the evening with a few friends and some drinks and some fries "
Susan Y,"Garforth, UK",Jan 2017,"To the Balanese government.I understand that the natural tides dump rubbish on the beaches, but there is no visible effort to clear it up! If every hawker was equipped with a litterpicker and a bin bag as part of the deal you'd sort the problem to a more reasonable degree. Billions of tourist dollars over the years should result in something more than an appologising and apologetic sign!Having travelled half way around the world to such a legendary and beautiful place the sea and the beaches are a HUGE disappointment and do you no credit Bali!You let down yourselves and, more importantly, the Balinese people!"
Elaine T,12 contributions,Sep 2016,Good place to have a bintang & watch the day pass by. Chair rental a bit pricey but we didn't barter either. Brought some bracelets from the women. Just be friendly & say no thank you they will leave you alone.

Nabila A,"Markham, Canada",Sep 2016,It was as if I was walking on a movie scene. We started at Kuta and then walked our way back to the hotel in Semniyak just before sunset. 
VThallur,"Chennai (Madras), India",Dec 2016,"Visited the beach close to the Courtyard and it was a BIG disappointment. It was so bad that I couldn't get myself to even take a photograph for uploading. The sands were full of garbage (plastic bottles, soda cans & wrappers). Didn't stay there even for  5 minutes after the 10 minute walk (one way)."

Donjjjordan,"Maspalomas, Spain",Jan 2017,"We went in January and was very disappointed. The beach was very dirty. The sea was rough and dirty with Brown foam riding the waves, the beach bars were les than inviting with un kept hotels lining the beach front. Sadly this experience was the reason for us relocating to Kayumanis."
Slou18,"Chester, UK",Jan 2017,"My family and I recently visited Bali and stayed in Seminyak for a few days. We visited the beach as we had been at Potato Head. The beach was filthy and the sea polluted. It resembled Rhyl beach but worse (for those of you who have visited the UK) After speaking to our local driver, this was due to the time of year and the change in current which washes up the rubbish in this direction. Not what you would imagine for the Indian ocean. Better beaches to visit were Pandawa beach(the best beach by far) Padang Padang and Kuta beach. "
Jennie M,"Dublin, Ireland",Jan 2017,I'm not sure if we went to the right part but we walked to the beach and it's honestly the dirtiest beach I've ever seen. It's so grim. We have a pool and the town is fab so that will do is but it's such a shame. 
Shazza,"Broadbeach, Australia",Jan 2017,"A great place for sunset watching. Many locals go there. Very dirty beach & not fit for swimming. There's also a very smelly polluted inlet to cross. As a beach it is terrible , sunsets yes"
Madeline K,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jan 2017,"I guess being from Australia I'm blessed with lovely beaches so I'm a bit biased. That being said, I've been to plenty of other beaches around the world that have been nice. Just expect rubbish everywhere and not much going on (understandably). This is the exact reason why it's important to book a nice hotel with a pool. "
Anthony E,"Leeds, UK",Dec 2016,"only went on the beach once it was filthy, rubbish all along the beach and we walked 2 mile on it to the next town"
Maggie M,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jan 2017,"the beach at Seminyak was dirty and disgusting the wind had blown up and it was  full of debri, dirty nappy, cane/bamboo washed up on beach  old polystyrene coffee cups etc we never swan in beach at all and council or govenrmetn had done very little to clean it up we swam at the pools in Montigo which were clean and refreshing. not the beach at all."
Shiramira,"Zurich, Switzerland",Dec 2016,"It's always dificult to rate a beach - as it can change daily due to currents and weather conditions etc..But at the moment - well actually we were there during christmas - the beach is so ugly as there is plastic trash everywhere!! Even if you try to walk into the ocean the plastic swims around your legs and there is at least 6 meters wide plastic trash ""raod"" at the beach.The only good thing is that like this everybody sees what we humans do to our planet and to our oceans!!"
Brookeellar,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2017,I knew the beaches in Seminyak weren't going to be anything like our Australian beaches but I didn't realise how filthy it would actually be. I didn't want to walk along the beach let alone swim. Rubbish everywhere. Just filthy 
_d_mostyn,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,its a must to enjoy Beef Rendang & cocktails the beach at sunset & watching those amazing balinese musicians & singers with their incredible soulful voices  under the bright colourful beach umbrellas & colourful bean bag chairs is one of my fav memories of bali
Vesana83,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Dec 2016,"Beach is very nice, full of bars and restaurant.View is just great, if you want to spend nice time, just don't miss to visit.Sunset is just stunning!"
John M,"Parkland, FL",Jan 2017,Water brown & very dirty. Sand is also brown & full of trash. Trash & debris everywhere. You walk & then need a bath/shower to clean up. No swimming-surf too rough.
AAlnazawi,18 contributions,Jan 2017,What made me sad is the amount of trash along the beach but the great thing is from this beach I saw the most amazing sunset in my whole life !!! 
John T,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,I realise it is the wet season but the amout of rubbish on the beach is disgusting. The quality of the water was terrible to say the least
Nick G,15 contributions,Jan 2017,It's shameful how much rubbish we tourists create and sadly the beach is where we see it at its worstMaybe a small levy on each tourist to pay for beach cleaning equipment
Magnificent2014,"Rome, Italy",Dec 2016,Lots of rubbish washing up on the beach but there are many people employed on the beach raking it up and then it is transferred to trucks and taken away.
Giovanni G,"Florianopolis, SC",Jan 2017,"Given, we do travel a lot. But this is, by far, the ugliest beach I ever saw. Yellow sand (not white as some say, or you have to be totally wasted), dirty (plastic) everywhere, beach 'bars' not taken care of, all playing their own music at the same time, etc. By far the worst beach experience ever. "
Antonis S,Qatar,Jan 2017,The setting is really nice!If you plan to see the sunset at any of the cafe-bars along the beach you should go there 2 hours earlier at the busy caffes.Very lay down!
Tia R,"Ballarat, Australia",Jan 2017,It definitely is a shame to see a beach absolutely littered with rubbish. I did hear that this is what happens every year around New Years. I suppose I'm a bit prim and proper considering Australian beaches are absolutely pristine! I think it just threw me back a little and made me appreciate where I live. Sunsets are amazing here however can't seem to take eyes away from the dirt coloured sand and rubbish that is scattered everywhere :(
kellyw0man,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Seminack Bali. Can be busy but if you go outside of school holidays it's not to bad.Check that you have good accomodation we prefere to stay in a private villa as it's nice to have the privacy with your own pool and so on. The restaurants have improve immensely lots of wonderful Australian chefs are now running them and offering fabulous fresh heathy food , you can even get a great cup of coffee. "
Lucy D,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"We recently stayed in Seminyak for 2 days and had just a few short steps to walk down to the beach. Unfortunately, the tide had brought in a lot of rubbish and there was hardly anyone in the water.We were told that the beach is cleaned every morning, but when the tide comes in, so does all the rubbish :(My best advice would be to got to the beach early in the morning, just after it has been cleaned."
Marylouise C,"Diamond Creek, Australia",Jan 2017,The beaches all along this strip from Kuta to Seminyak need a thorough clean up.  The standard is very low.  It seems that all the rubbish that has no where else to go ends up on the shore line & menas plastic and all sorts of debris go into the beautiful sea - such a shame.  This really lets the whole place down.
sarahrosemayer,"Encinitas, CA",Jan 2017,"I was excited to be able to walk to the beach from our hotel, but sadly when we arrived it was covered in trash. There was no clean space, we walked for maybe 15 minutes and found no solace from the trash, even used syringes. It's sad that Seminyak cannot keep its beaches clean."
Gaurav B,11 contributions,Jan 2017,Good beach with lots to do. Be sure to be careful with small kids as water is fast. Though kids enjoy a loy.
coraliekengen,"Paris, France",Jan 2017,"heaven beach with turquoize ocean, white sand and friendly balinese, really love it! Also great for surfing"
RoundTheWorld38,calgary,Jan 2017,"I've been around the world and been to many beaches in many countries both poor and rich.  This is by far the most disgusting, upsetting and disturbing thing I have ever seen.  The beach is literally covered in garbage.  Swimming in the ocean there is garbage floating everywhere.  You should not come out of the ocean with a plastic bag wrapped around your foot, cigarette packages, yogurt containers, you name it.  Apparently it's all coming from Java the main island, but I've been told it's been happening for a long time.  Honestly it is very upsetting.  Don't come here unless you're happy to stay in your hotel at the pool  If you're a beach person avoid at all costs.  Go literally anywhere else."
Rachel R,"Port Stephens, Australia",Dec 2016,"I arrived on 27/12 and this was my first trip to Bali. The beach was filled with rubbish, which I learnt soon enough happens every year in Seminyak. The sand was the colour of dirt - not very enticing to lay a towel on! It was a shame that the hotel I stayed in employed guys to ""clean up"" the rubbish, but this literaly involved pushing the stuff further up the beach, either out of view of the hotel guests, or just far enough so that when the tide came in, it took the rubbish back out into the sea! Really disappointing that this hasn't been dealt with considering it happens every year."
Bruno Wolf,"Villefranche-sur-Mer, France",Jan 2017,"I was in Seminyak in the winter 2014 and was already shocked then by the incredibly dirty beach and ocean. The sewage is running straight into the sea on various points along the beach. This has not changed at all from my first visit. The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!! Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror. We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time. I wish that Bali takes this step too otherwise it will be a lost paradise !"
davorow,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,post NYE this beach is disgusting. rubbish just sits there all over the beach...some places it was hard to see sand.
Krev10,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,Watched a live band and the sun set one night here and it was such a great experience. The beach gets insanely packed at night with everyone coming to watch. There are tonnes of bean bags and cushions in front of the beach bars and cafe's and you can order drinks and food while you're there.  
rubberpinata,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Filthy beach with an eye-popping amount of debris that went as far as the eye can see. We paid for beach chairs (IDR 100,000 for a pair of them after bargaining!), then though of running into the sea when we got too hot, then changed our minds when we saw the sheer amount of rubbish and sewage around. We were all too happy to get out after that."
John H,"Joondanna, Australia",Jan 2017,So sad to see rubbish everywhere on the beach. It needs a good clean up and some sort of policing on people littering. 
Yelena,"Turin, Italy",Jan 2017,I had to wash my feet three times after visiting that beach. The sensation of the powerful ocean waves washing trash over your body is deeply disturbing. And it's trash that you can see has been there for months. This sight will turn you into an environmentalist.
Alan F,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"Family friendly, very crowded- I myself love crowded places, with live music! Sunset views are fantastic! The beach is pretty clean, nice to walk in the shore. "
Steve T,3 contributions,May 2016,"No hawkers, just locals enjoying martial arts and soccer at sundown.  Worth the visit. especially at sunset.  try the fresh grilled chicken on the way in. "
AzzaJP,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"Not a place you would want to spend the day for sure, seems a bit grubby and there is a lot of rubbish - wave and big and powerful so good for surfing but maybe not families.If you do want to go to the beach walk along and to a part of the beach in-front of the posh hotels as it seems they pay people to clean up those sections.not really the paradise beach you hear about"
Mark H,"Enmore, Australia",Jan 2017,"Appalling place. Our second visit & we hoped it was cleaned up, but it's worse. Kilometres of beach covered in plastic bottles & rubbish. We went in the water - full of sewerage & other rubbish, it'd be dangerous to your health to swim in it. The locals don't seem to care & they blame the tourist boats but don't even clean it. What should be a beautiful place is far from it.It's a sad example of rampant development & apathy. We'll never go to Bali again. It's ruined."
ju7iet,"Hampton, Australia",Dec 2016,Great for listening to music and drinking by the beach sitting on bean bags...not really good for young family though.
Helena S,Germany,Jan 2017,"We chose Seminyak for our honeymoon stay as it supposed to be one of the best beaches on Bali, but were very much disappointed to say the least. We met only pollution with plastic, huge mountains of rubbish on and next to the beach about which locals say it comes from China. Also it is very crowded and very loud. In June 2016 most of the time swimming was prohibited due to huge waves and every 100m stinky sewage water was led into the ocean. It is a tragedy that the awareness about the unbelievable environmental damage is that little..."
Grantwatson777,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,It's an ok beach but Kuta and Legian are much better. There is a big undertow which puts so much sand in the water. There were some good sets of waves so the surfers might like it. There is a good little bar 707 in the batubelig area that is worth a beer after a swim or surf
Zugaro,39 contributions,Jan 2017,Great for dinner on the beach you can eat relax and listen to live music . Sunset was pretty. Don't swim here the beach is dirty !!
david d,"Bangkok, Thailand",Dec 2016,"Beach loungers are beanbags. they leak. Millions of pellets everywhere, and beach bands set too close together so you hear two bands at once. This isn't celebrating sunset...it's celebrating idiocy."
Tau S,"Hyderabad, India",Jun 2016,"When we planned our trip that beachs in bali would be like the once in Thailand, nice, blue, calm. However when we arrived here we realized that its not the same. If you are someone, who enjoys the beach.and don't use that term loosely, I do mean the beach and not a beach side resort, then think again, the waves are very loud and the shore is choppy. You can't even sit on the beach cause sand gets so hot that you'll burn your self. Very disappointed."
Deepak Azad,"New Delhi, India",Oct 2016,"Nice clean and happening beach. specially during sunsets it become pretty happening with beach goers, music, drinks. nice fun overall."
EricaB1326,"Chicago, IL",Jan 2017,If you want a feel for night club life and people hustling you then this is your place. The beach was so littered we were walking through an area where the water was brown and frothy. Rivers from the town empty into this beach area and you have to walk through the filth even if you are just trying to walk along the beach. It's sad how much garbage we saw. No one seemed to care either. 
norto22,"Noosaville, Australia",Jan 2017,"Antons bar and Andre ,what a great bunch of young trustworthy gentlemen, you can leave all your belongings with them safely and enjoy many beverages..there is a young man named Putra who works in bar next door Auzzie bar who is a must to see as well ,rips up the beach breaks on 66 with his phantom surf board . "
Jacqui C,7 contributions,Jan 2017,Rubbish in the water makes this side of Bali a very sorry sight. People from the sunset clubs on the beach leave there rubbish behind and then you find yourself swimming in the ocean with hundreds of plastic bottles and rubbish. Stick to your pool side resorts!!!
Kelly C,4 contributions,Jan 2017,"Don't expect an idyllic, white sand beach....this isn't it. I know I am spoiled by the beaches in Australia but there is a huge problem with rubbish. There's piles of it everywhere and when I was surfing I was surfing with so much plastic and rubbish. However, the beach bars are nice - very cheap and you get to hang out with locals. The sunsets are spectacular and I highly recommend some beers on the beach at the bars at sunset."
anne J,Sydney,Jan 2017,We had a drink on the bean bags on the beach. The sand and water is very dirty. Nice sunset and interesting characters but didn't feel the need to visit again. 
gkaytrips,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"its quite long, beautiful at any time of the day but specially at sunset, its you and the beach, all other noises just disappear"
Fiona S,"Bargara, Australia",Jan 2017,"Loved Bali but WTF, the beach is absolutely and utterly disgusting. Swimming would definitely constitute a health hazard, that is if you don't get tangled up in some of the debris. Unless the Indonesian government takes radical action, nobody will go there."
navpreet k,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,"A good beach .. i spent most of my evenings here as during the day shore was littered and was very annoying to see it like that.During dusk, the restaurants come to life., you can easily spend long time eating, drinking bintang and gazing the sun. personally i preffered seminyak area and beach over Kuta.."
Linda L,Sydney,Dec 2016,When Seminyak Beach has been cleaned of storm or rainy season debris it is a great beach to relax and swim.If you require shade and in the Balinese heat it is advisable be prepared to pay 100 000IDR for a umbrella and lounge.
Mark S,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"During the day the beach is disgusting.Night time not so bad as you don't get to see the filth right along the entire beach. The water is like a cesspool,I certainly wouldn't swim in it."
19Lisa77,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,When we visited there was no rubbish like there was at beaches at Legian and Kuta. Also nobody bugging you to buy stuff which was a bonus.
aghr2017,"Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia",Dec 2016,"Very dirty, a lot of garbage coming from the sea and Java island make this beach entirely unattractive place to visit."
Soniasla,"Ilminster, UK",Dec 2016,"Such a shame that fellow travellers don't put their rubbish in the beach , they have ruined this beach ."
Darren J,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Jan 2017,"Xmas/wet season is not the time to stay in Seminyak. The beaches in this area are covered in rubbish that washes up every tide this time of year. We've been here for 3 weeks over Xmas/NY and haven't spent any time on the beaches, it's that bad. You'd be better off staying on the eastern side, Sanur area. Nice beaches, clear water."
Biz N,17 contributions,Jul 2016,Hello Future Bali Traveler !   trip of a lifetime.  The waves the people the sand and the surf. Amazing time.  don't miss this.  
Alan M,"Millbrae, CA",Dec 2016,"We are pretty spoiled in Australia & New Zealand for the cleaniness of our beaches. Unfortunately, the beaches we went to in Seminyak were full of rubbish & a bit smelly in places. Really takes away from the experience. However, we did enjoy a nice sunset which was lovely, and the photos couldn't pick up the rubbish!"
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Good beach with a number of nice hotels but not really suitable for swimming due to strong current and unpredictable waves...
_swiss_miss_hi,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2016,"Going in November I thought it would be busy, but I was wrong.  It was really the best time to go - water was perfect and the beach not busy.  Highly recommend it!"
Travel üí´,"Saint Louis, MO",Dec 2016,"The seminyak beach is a local beach not a private one, lacks basic cleanliness.The water is very dirty filled with plastic bottles and caps and other junk.Please visit private beaches adjoining the resorts instead.The water temperature was warm for December."
FamilyTravelJunkkie,"Wahroonga, Australia",Jan 2017,By far the most polluted beach I have ever seen.  Definitely not good for swimming.  The shopping and restaurants are awesome but stay in your pool
Littleswon,"Lake Forest, CA",Dec 2016,Everything was overly priced and you constantly have to haggle with the sellers.  Food was over priced on the beach and it was VERY VERY dirty.  I didn't want to even take off my shoe in case I catch something.
Molly L,18 contributions,Jan 2017,The beach is very disappointing... obviously polluted with tons of rubbish along the beach. Sunsets are the only saving grace!
Yvettejj,"Bendigo, Australia",Dec 2016,"I have seen Seminyak Beach during the dry and its beautiful but unfortunately on our last trip during the wet season it was sad to see so much rubbish on the beach. Yes, great for sunsets but so is Sanur and Jimbaran without the rubbish. I wouldn't take kids here during the wet season too much rubbish. Something needs to be done to improve this as many traders are loosing business as people don't want to be there."
KathynGreg W,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2017,We were told recent storms was the cause of the rubbish all overthe beach. Pretty sad for local business owners as it definitely turned tourists off  being at the beach. Local workers  constantly cleaning the beach but was hard for them to keep up with the  rubbish  rolling in
Natalie W,27 contributions,Feb 2016,"You will find lots of upscale bars and restaurants. Take a taxi at night, as there are stray dogs that become quite aggressive in the later hours. Taxis are cheap and worth avoiding the hassle. People are friendly and nice here. "
Nikki B,32 contributions,Jan 2017,"So sad about the beach, full of rubbish. Sharing images only because it's such a beautiful place and needs some attention. We had a great time in Bali and Gilli T. Did not spend much time on Seminyak beach for this reason, such a great place to visit still. Hope this was due to bad weather but either way more plastic free alternatives need to be in place for hotels and restaurants to keep this rubbish free, help the environment and tourism economy flowing. "
Kristall88,"Olching, Germany",Dec 2016,"The beach in Seminjak has collapsed into Inge of the worst place in the world.  In front of Hotel Puri Saron they Place K√ºssens in the sand beginning 3pm until midnight for a drink to watch the sunset. The mushers now reach the waterlevel. Every few meters there is terribly loud Musik from speakers, each Musik different!! I have been coming to Bali may, many time-I loved the island, but now this is a nightmare. Only money,money,money counts!Bye,bye Bali- me no more!!!"
PeggyArchie,"Thames Ditton, UK",Jan 2017,"Lovely beach, although expect to see a lot litter which unfortunately washes up from other islands üå¥ "
Braden B,13 contributions,Jan 2017,"We came in January, and I read that there was a lot of trash on the west coast of Bali at this time, but I thought people were being dramatic. They weren't kidding. It might have been one of the dirtiest beaches I have ever been to. And it is a black sad beach (along with most of the west coast). When I heard this, I was thinking it would be like the Hawaiian black sand beaches, and I was excited. It was nothing like that. It just looked dirty. It is still soft sand though. The waves are great for surfing all year round though!"
Maurice W,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"This beach is out the back of the hotel we are staying in, and I must say the sunsets are superb but the beach itself is nothing to write home about lots of rubbish and people,in the evening they set up bean bags on the beach so you can chill out and watch the sunset with the obligatory drink if your into that stuff?"
Zibergdi,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2016,very dirty from the blown in rubbish. wouldn't not recommend as a relaxing beach to hang out at. very different from Australia's clean beaches
ApurvGarg,"Noida, India",Jan 2017,Dirty beachGuys get the authorities to start the cleaning process Ugly dorky beach ! Not for sun loungers Many restaurants and each clubs located on it 
Anna C,6 contributions,Jan 2017,Waste waste waste. One of  the most disgusting place i've ever seen. Sorry to lost part of my holiday in this place ( we fortunately escape to Nusa Dua )
Jen N Brett S,"Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2017,Grt area. Went there too take photos of sunset. Beach abit dirty.  Lots of ppl.  Bit dark walking area there. Lots of scooters.  Amazing restaurants 
nickyb337,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"Lots of rubbish and debris, too many sellers. quite a few restaurants along the beach and quite reasonable. two sunloungers were 200,000 "
t2lae,"Richmond, Australia",Jan 2017,"Super dirty with rubbish everywhere from used needles, plastic to you name it. The sand is black and the waves are just crashing into shore with more rubbish. Full of Aussie bogans drinking and sun baking on the dirtiest beach I have seen. Just purely tourist girly bars and cheap tourist trapped shops.Not worth visiting. There's other better beaches in Bali. "
Robert H,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,We went in New Year's Day so they were prob suffering from the night before. But it looked like a rubbish dump and I couldn't see anyone trying to clean it. The sand was brown and a bit grainy. I wouldn't go back unless I was on a surf trip.
Mokkey8,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,"I'm glad I didn't choose a hotel by this beach as it was horrendous. It was like a rubbish dump with piles of trash which had yet to be cleared and more rubbish being washed up.I was told by a local that at this time of year, the winds and the tides bring in all the rubbish. Better beaches to be found at Nusa Dua during this period of the year.I assume the higher ratings were when reviewers were visiting during other months.Definitely do not recommend visiting this 'beach' now."
priyanka2,"London, UK",Jan 2017,When u see a sunset in this place u realise that best things in life do come free!!!Gorgeous place. Not crowded ! U shud try and be there around sunset and see god paint the sky! 
Anne_Aalborg,"Aalborg, Denmark",Jan 2017,The beach is wide and the waves are good fun. Unfortunately the beach is very dirty. The locals and the hotels do their very Best to keep it clean but still there is plastic floating around in the water and is washed up on shore.The prices for sunbeds are way to high and the dealers are somewhat arrogant.I wouldn't go here again.
Wildovertravel,18 contributions,Jan 2017,Seminyak's beaches close to the hotels are extremely dirty and thus I was very disappointed. I don't believe it's worth paying extra to be close to the beach. 
Alana K,72 contributions,Dec 2016,"In december because of all the storms there is rubbish all over the beach and the water is brown. In june and july the water was clear and no rubbish on the beach. I would recommend going to Seminyak just not the main beach, there are many small beaches to go too that would replace the main one."
Duncan E,"Elgin, Scotland, United Kingdom",Dec 2016,"If this is the beach by potato head then it resembles a land fill site, rubbish strewn everywhere, broken furniture etc.Simply the worst beach in an area promoting tourism that I have ever been to."
ankkit9,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,Water is kinda black. You have massage therapist annoying u with their offers. Shacks r expensive for God known reasons. You get serious sunburns in this beach even when sun was not so shinyBetter book a villa and relax there.
TWEEDY5,"Plymouth, UK",Dec 2016,"We walked down to Seminyak beach through dirty streets, loose dogs and motor bikes driving on the pavements! When we arrived at the beach all we could see was a carpet of rubbish! Nobody attempting to clear it up. It's just everywhere and it stinks. Sanitary items, needles and general crap. As we walked further along the beach it got worse. We have been to many beaches in many different countries,  this is by far the worst. Paradise LOST."
Timothy,"Boras, Sweden",Dec 2016,"this beach is a nice place but would be better if it was cleaned more often. there is a lot of trash that washed up on shore, especially after a storm. "
Mark H,39 contributions,Nov 2016,"You have to go to the beach when your in Seminyak but don't expect much.The sand is average, the waves are average and the beach itself is very dirty. It is crowded with chairs, bean bags, noise from bars right on the beach. You have to go and have a look but there are better things to do and don't build a whole day around it. "
lynette291,"Pretoria, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Beaches of Cuta and Seminyak are totally unswimmable due to the filth and debris in the water. Disgusting objects are everywhere and this area should be avoided. The beach vendors are a huge bother and the constant harrasment drives one up the wall - some even become aggressive if you ignore them! All in all, Bali was a complete dissapointment and the traffic is unbearble."
ClaireBlueMountains,"Wentworth Falls, Australia",Dec 2016,We entered the beach at KuDeTa. It looked like this point was where beach rubbish was collected. It was great to see a rubbish removal system in place and dedicated workers collecting and removing rubbish and I am very aware that the rubbish they were collecting was doe to tourism and possibly bad weather so I am certainly not apportioning any blame however I would not go swimming as the water was visibly dirty and the sand was dirty as well. I am sorry Bali that our love of the island is the very thing causing the island to lose its feel of Paradise.
dianepalma,"London, UK",Dec 2016,Not sure whether due to a rare weather condition or not but the beach is very windy all day! The sand gets all over our face and eyes! Lucky my 3yo and I wear our sunnies so it helps us to see a bit clear.  We made sand castle but the beach is so dirty that we only spent 15-20mins there. There is no shower facility to clean up too. Not sure why this beach is popular but I guess not for little ones. Or maybe I chose the wrong area of the beach. Won't be coming back.
Nelsam854,"Washington DC, DC",Dec 2016,Trash everywhere! From far it looked so beautiful until getting closer where you literally see trash EVERYWHERE!!! 
John_useridtaken,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Per the title, the beach was covered in winblown rubbish and driftwood. Nothing redeeming. Suggest going to one of the beach side clubs instead"
skat66,"Caulfield, Australia",Dec 2016,"Went to Seminyak and stayed at the RoyaB Beach for a week. The beach was a disgrace covered in filth and apart from a couple of hotels trying but losing, there was no pick up of the piles of stinking garbage mounting up on the beach.  I have never seen a beach that was so trashed and no one seemed to care."
TonyPoor,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,we went down to the beach area restaurants to meet up with friends for dinner and there are loads of eating areas with great food.took a beachfront walk to friends hotel and the beach is probably the most littered beach i have ever walked along. you could not help but not to walk on plastic drink containers. worst beach around i cannot see how the people could be proud of this area absolutely a disgrace.
Jets3tt5r11,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,Arrived In Seminyak hoping to visit the beach area. Noticed large amounts of rubbish spread everywhere. Not appealing at all. Once of the dirties beaches I have come across. The locals make an effort to clean it up but it's really bad!
Subbu N,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2016,It was a huge disappointment to see this beach lined by plastics and garbage all along the shoreline.A complete eye sore!
Paul R,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2016,Stayed in Seminyak for 7 nights and loved the restaurants on offer - all cuisines. Walked the beach every day and enjoyed the early morning tranquility. Had a sunset evening at Potato Head by the beach and this is a must do.
Princess_Ronna,"Xi'an, China",Dec 2016,The beach was really clean even with the past storms that had happened.  They had cleaned it up nicely!  The sand was nice between my toes and the Beach was really happening.  There are a lot of lovely restaurants around this area and an easy walk from my hotel.
kteecee,"Cebu City, Philippines",Jun 2016,This was the beach closest to us. It's pretty crowded. I can see why some people would call it dirty with all the tourists around. I'm sure Bali can offer you better beaches. Not really a must see.
caring247,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"We were shocked at the amount of plastic and rubbish that is washed up on the beach in front of our accomodation in Seminyak. It looked like a land fill tip site. Every day teams of locals trawl through the rubbish sorting organic waste from plastic, chopping up driftwood the size of tree trunks with chainsaws and bagging up rubbish in plastic bin liners, piling it up on the sand dunes, only for it to be washed back into the ocean at high tide. I can't believe the hotels along the beach don't help with the rubbish removal.  Time for big business to make a stand and say NO to plastic and commit to cleaning up this beach for the sake of the locals who rely on tourism for their livelihood. I won't be coming back to Seminyak."
Tahlia C,40 contributions,Dec 2016,Seminyak beach is lovely at sunset however any other time of the day it is quite busy and basically just another beach in Bali. It is pretty dirty and quite busy with tourists. 
Alyanna H,"General Santos, Philippines",Dec 2016,"Went here as soon as I arrived in Seminyak and it's probably one of the most dirtiest beaches I've ever seen in my life. I had a surfing lesson and the waves were good, but every now and then you get caught in rubbish. Most of it comes from the sea, apparently mostly from Java (at least, that's what our surfing instructors told us). It's good to see the local people making an effort to clean it up though. The sunset is quite pretty as well if you try and overlook the rubbish along the shore."
zen008,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Not sure if it is the time of the year but it was full of rubbish, plastic bottles and not appealing at all..... Preferably head to nusa dua for the white sand clean beaches. "
Mollymoo_10,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2016,"The beach is terrible there is rubbish all over it, Stay by your pool much better idea and you don't have to put up with the touts."
Michael S,"Geelong, Australia",Dec 2016,Dirty and full of rubbish. Do not swim as storm water and sewage would be of concern. Very quiet when we were there as l guess people didn't want to risk it. Lots of lounge seats to hire with water buckets at the end to clean your feet. Massages also offered. 
KDoozy,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"What a disgrace. We should all feel guilty as we are all responsible for it. Rubbish as far as the eye can see. Mostly plastics and mostly food-related, eg. straws, yoghurt pouches, bags. It is unfathomable how businesses like Potato Head and Ku De Ta survive surrounded by such filth. If I had booked a holiday at a beachside resort in the expectation that I'd be lying on the beach and swimming in the sea every day, I'd be devastated. This poor planet of ours is slowly choking to death and Seminyak Beach is evidence of that..."
anjie27,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,Full of rubbish. No fun for little children looking to play in the sand. Do not suggest going there unless you've heard about a massive clean up.  Jimbaran and other beaches are probably better. 
Helen S,"Greater Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"I have never seen the beach so dirty, kudos to the Balinese for trying to keep it clean but the water is loaded with plastic, paper and wood. Sad"
Rachel J,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"It's quite upsetting that the beach was filled with trash. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING IN THE SEA! They're literally everywhere. The only upside there was the ambience, & my pizza was good. It gets crowded but you can still find a private spot. "
I_S_B_L,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,I went there to catch the sunset & it was awesome. The waves were huge and strong. It was incredibly windy.
valechuchu,"Montevideo, Uruguay",Dec 2016,"I don't know if it was the time of the year or if it is always like this nowadays, but the astonishing quantities of dirt and rubbish, piling up in mountains in the beach is totally disappointing to say the least. Seminyak is the first spot we hit on Bali once we arrived to our honeymoon. It is so sad to see the ocean and the waves carrying such amazing quantities of rubbish. We took a taxi and went to sanur, were it was much better..."
Vinayak S,178 contributions,Oct 2016,"The view at the beach is really great, no hindrance and no mess. You can enjoy a full day out at this place and can soak in the calmness of colorful sunset."
Saud,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"Compare it to Kuta beach, I noticed that Kuta beach is much cleaner, maybe because when I went there it was windy. "
Sep3ani,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2016,Seminyak beach is one of many beach to go in Bali. Many restaurant near the beach. You can enjoy afternoon and evening on Seminyak beach. Don't forget to playing kite there
Niels L,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Dec 2016,Owners in the area really need to do something about regular cleaning of the beach if the autorities are idle. This lovely beach us much less attracting to visitors if it is not cleaned daily.
Aravind K,2 contributions,Nov 2016,The view is extraordinary. A mountain close to the beach is always beautiful. Beach gives a beautiful view of the sunset. A calm and serene location with a lot of cafes on the edge of the beach allows us to take a good view of the sunset and enjoy the drinks
Majid J,"Stockholm, Sweden",Dec 2016,"Rainy season, all the trash just goes down to the sea during heavy rain. Also some sewer water goes right into the ocean. I don't recommend this beach. "
MGDevi,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"watch sunset almost every weekend here, sometimes its crowd, sometimes not. many family with puppy or strangers and tourist for afternoon walk. sometimes visit this beach after sunset for a nice pictures"
Joseph C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,"Bringing high expectation, me and my family with 2 young ones were quickly disappointed when we arrived. The whole beach was filled with litters. The sand wasn't smooth for children. The wave was huge and dangerous for children. Overall, it may be only good for jogging."
Reza P,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"nice beach to hang out,, great sunset.Make sure bring all you need if you want to hang out there..."
Alex4sport,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Dec 2016,"No so populate as Kuta with surfers, as Nusa Dua with russian swimmers.  Nice place to relax and view sunset. The waves are big, and a lot of garbage are thrown on the beach from the ocean, but thats common issue for whole Bali. You mostly can't swim here, but you can experience the waves hitting you :)Seminyak itself is the best place for eat and drink and party. Enjoy!"
PearlySim,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"Been to Bali many times and this is my saddest visit.   Washed up on the entire stretch of the shore (Kuta beach, Legian beach and Seminyak beach) are trash.  Trash dumped by humans from Indonesia's mainland and now washed up on the once lovely beaches of Bali.One can't even walk out through the whitewash or paddle out without having plastic bags, ropes or strings wrapped around one's legs or arms. Plastic wrappers, condom wrappers and bottles are amidst some of the trash dumped and washed up.  It's too much trash to list them. Let the photos speak for the once beautiful beaches of Bali.  I'm very saddened to see how we humans have failed to love Mother Nature."
aanaca,1 contribution,Dec 2016,"Must visit this beach while in Seminyak area, lill bit crowded in the afternoon by family and local. But its fine."
Jacqueline G,"Whanganui, New Zealand",Oct 2016,"I love Seminyak beach!! It's always lovely to walk along and is looked after and rubbish cleaned away every morning. You can sit and relax on a deck chair, have a swim or surf and then a cool relaxing drink at sunset at one of the friendly beach bars"
Lynne K,"Mackay, Australia",Dec 2016,"Full of rubbish disgusting filth, save your time and money. Would be just as clean going to dump in Australia "
Fcogayan,"Santiago, Chile",Nov 2016,"This place is the restaurant of GrandMas, so we try almost everything (we spend almost 15 days)The food was really great, always good service and chilled live acoustic music in the afternoons We suggest to try the breaks fasts and tapas. I think is good price for the food, but there is different places to eat for the same money, so you have to choose. I recommend some tapas and beer in the afternoonEnjoy"
Neil W,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Like the rest of the beaches on this stretch it is diety and has heaps of rubbish at this time of year. Good to walk along at low tide though. 
sharon s,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2016,"This beach is much more quieter than others.  Which makes it much more pleasant.  They have lounge and umbrella rentals for those wanting a lazy day at the beach. Take a taxi here.  It's not far from seminyak square, but the roads are a killer for pedestrians.  Taxi is cheap.  Ask driver first.  Some will try and rip you off.  Although they are still cheap too. "
Carjam123,"Manawatu-Wanganui Region, New Zealand",Apr 2016,"Avoid - unless you are a beer swilling night club loving person with no appreciation for the environment. The food options are great is the only plus. Narrow congested streets, like Asian Benidorm - a Mecca for the crass and tasteless "
Antipodean,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Nice beach with warm water and grey (not white) sand. Lots of tourists and locals enjoying the day and watching the sun set. Locals selling kites and necklaces with out too much hassle. It is not as good as white sand beaches of many countries but how can you complain when the water is warm and the sun is setting with a nice cooling breeze as the sun sets. 
Karin,15 contributions,Dec 2016,"The beach has black sand and some fair waves that i saw quite some people surfing. It is not that crowded in the morning, but it gets super full and colorful nearing sunset. The beach was filthy in the early morning, mostly rubbish from the previous night (it gets pretty festive), but they clean it daily until it is fairly clean."
KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Why are there so many people at this filthy cesspit of a beach? It's really not worth wasting your time here. Rubbish everywhere. 
Heidi3205,"St Kilda, Australia",Dec 2016,"It could have been the worst day of the year to arrive but Seminyak beach was a mess of rubbish, black dirty sand, fowl smells and more rubbish washing in from the sea and from the open sewer / drain / creek that opens onto the beach beside the Royal Beach Seminyak resort. Apparently this happens during the wet season.  We retreated to Sanur where the beach is pristine - but no surf. "
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,"We normally stay at Seminyak as we like the shops and restaurants around this area.  However, the beaches in Seminyak are mainly black sand beaches and is not quite what you would expect if you are more used to white sand beaches.  As such we do not normally spend time at the beach here or swim in the sea if we come to seminyak.  If your preference is for white sand beaches, then Nusa Dua may be more your cup of tea.Being in the west part of Bali, the beaches here do offer good sunsets in the evenings."
Ali202,"Noosa, Australia",Dec 2016,We had in our heads that we would be down the beach all the time .. unfortunately the beach was so full of rubbish in and out of the water that the only swimming we did was at our pool in the villa .. disgraceful that it is a tourist destination and there is so much plastic and rubbish everywhere !!!!! Yuck
Michel1965,Z√ºrich,Dec 2016,"We went all around Bali, the beaches in Seminyak are large and long. Many beach clubs where you can or must rent beds. Water seams fair. The sand has not the loved white colours but a classic brown as you find by us in construction. Nothing is perfekt but sure nice"
SazzadHossain,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Dec 2016,Its a quite beach with some bar and less beach activities because of most of tourist stays here with a private villa. But the sunrise and sunset from this beach is excellent.
geraldine157,"Hobart, Australia",Dec 2016,Do yourself a favor and give this  beach and miss  there are great beachside in other parts of the island 
bagusprawitra,"Bandung, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"Seminyak beach is one of my favorite beach, it's near my fav beach front cafe like la plancha and the champlung, my friends and me enjoy every sunset over there with the bottle of beers, so come and try the beach ‚úåüòéüåäüåÖ"
Arthidxb,Dubai,Dec 2016,Enjoyed the breeze and some time with the family on the beach. Not too crowded. Occasional street hawkers passing by.
RobertaBertone,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is absolutely gorgeous, especially at sunset!I did not get a chance to go swimming, but there is a great vibe all around, lots of people and venues to have fun at!"
Maria Z,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2016,"A difficult one to score beacuse on the one hand to sit on the sand and swim in the water of Seminyak beach is quite terrible. The dark sand and unpleasant surf  (can be dangerous) is not really conducive to playful and enjoyable frolicking. Indeed the lack of swimmers most of the time is a testament to the less than ideal conditions. Additionally like most beaches in Bali dumping of rubbish is normal as is the vast amount of influx of rubbish from Java (affecting West coast) . Add to that the fact that dogs roam freely and you get the gist. On the other hand the beaches are what makes Bali Bali. Seminyak  is where you can see the most beautiful sunsets, the view from the various eateries all along Seminyak beach is colourful with various vendors selling their wears. From colourful kites to an array of nic naks, So many colourful bean hags along the beach as you get closer to double six and virtually hundreds of colourful umbrellas at the Southern end make the beach transform from an 'ugly duckling' to a beautiful 'swan'"
John P,"Tairua, New Zealand",Dec 2016,"Beautifully warm surf; comfortable loungers available for hire, with bar service provided.  Only complaint was the high level of wrapper, bags and similar trash in the water. "
Patrick L,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Seminyak!A shoppers and gourmet paradise here in Bali but when the heat hits you and you just need some respite from all that heat, buy some swim wear if you didn't pack it and head for the beach just parallel to the shopping strip.The water is warm and the breeze cool and that makes for a perfect combination to cool off.There are ample places for internal refreshments too; water, beer, cocktails and food galore."
Bev w,"Tallahassee, FL",Nov 2016,"Lots efforts to keep the beach picked up by the community were evident, but it was still pretty trashy.  I was reluctant to get in the water after a first day walk on the beach that took us through several stinky washes.  I enjoyed my visit to Bali and we had great accommodations with very good food, but the beach up close was a disappointment.  When veiwed from a distance it was beautiful the surf was aqua and the wave action was impressive.  I thought the grey sand with evidence of the volcanic geography was unique, but smell and trash are hard to ignore.  There must be better beaches than Seminyak. It was the most disappointing part of my visit."
hannah g,"Wollongong, Australia",Dec 2016,"Beautiful spot, lots of those beach sunbeds to hire for the day to avoid sitting on the sand. It's super relaxing and tons of restaurants and bars line the sand so perfect to slip away for a bite to eat too. Beware though, you will be approached by a lot of locals trying to sell their products to you throughout the day.. Then again, you are in Bali! "
Jess H,13 contributions,Dec 2016,"Lots and lots of rubbish and bamboo on this beach. Sand is kinda black and the water that is coming from the town into the beach smells. We walked the length and didn't feel like stopping anywhere, I guess you don't go to Seminyak for the beach! "
poly_only,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2016,the beach is much more cleaner than kuta beach..one of my favourite spot to catch sunset...try to grab your favorite drinks in one of the beach bar there :) worth :)
Tania K,"Somerset, England",Dec 2016,"Walked from Seminyak to Kuta along this beach which has something for everyone! Such friendly people offering drinks, sun beds, massage or food."
Jason S,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2016,"Not a bad beach when it's clean. Depending on the weather, can get overrun with rubbish. The locals do their best to clean up each morning."
reindeerchronicles_,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"It was not anything fantastic, but do give it a visit if you have time to spare! Beach is generally clean and good for taking a stroll with your family and friends."
Benn1973,"Kempsey, Australia",Dec 2016,Not as good as most beaches on theeast coast Australia but definitely better then Kuta beach or Nusa dua
Aaron H,67 contributions,Dec 2016,"I would like to come back and learn to surf, the waves looked incredible! You could literally taste the salt from the beach - there were lots of people trying to sell you stuff but they weren't too bad if you just say No politely !"
Pav21K,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2016,"I had visited this beach in the noon, since it was a low season, enjoyed my time here. Clean and white sand beach, excellent choice for surfers. Do visit the beachfront cafes and restaurants for a sunset and great food and drinks."
Prisha N,India,Sep 2016,The place is good for relaxing! In the evening it was set up with a colorful umbrellas in the seaside. 
trahas,"Queensland, Australia",Nov 2016,"Clean beach stretches for miles. Its a beautiful slice of paradise, only down side are the hawkers, but you get them everywhere!"
Kerry S,"Sale, Australia",Dec 2016,"the ocean was great, waves not too rough, comfortable lounge chairs to hire at a vert cheap rate, 2 or 3 food and drink huts close by for refreashments  "
cheeky014,"High Wycombe, Australia",Nov 2016,What a beautiful view of sunset and the beach absolutely gorgeous - very relaxing and comfortable - had a great time
mustanggt08,"Rudolfstetten, Switzerland",Nov 2016,nice place to relax with sandy beach. good for surfing and to have a good time.only a little bit windy
Fifi_Mothei,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Oct 2016,This is the beach to go to when looking for a little excitement. Plenty beachside bars and restaurants to choose from. Lots of people everywhere but the beach is big enough to accommodate everyone. Do hang around even after the sun had gone down for some drinks. 
breejm,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,There is so many places to go and sit and eat or drink on Seminyak Beach. I would recommend it mostly for the sunset as it is just divine!!! 
lakshit s,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,"This a chill out beachIt decently clean. I expected  it to be cleaner.You would find a lot of beach cafes with bean bags. You will also find the regular ones.Gra a bean bag shack and chill on a sunset.Enjoy your meal/drink/with your partner.Avoid monsoon, as rain may spoil it a little bit."
Margaret W,"Ashford, UK",Nov 2016,So much space. Beautiful warm water. A must. There are women selling gorgeous sarongs. Perfect for presents.
Greyson622,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"I would not recommend people to go to seminyak beach if you are thinking that it's gonna be all white and clean. December is the raining season, rubbish are being washed up from the other islands to seminyak beach, it's really dirty and most of the time it's raining.I would say the other season will be fine because it seems like a really good place for surfing and tanning."
Melanie R,Siem reap,Dec 2016,"The beach itself is a let down, very few facilities for those wanting to catch the sun, bothered by sellers, no bathrooms or food or drink facilities on the beach but it is cleaned daily"
Barry T,"Warminster, UK",Dec 2016,Litter everywhere. Couldn't believe the amount of rubbish swept ashore. Filthy. Our local landfill is tidier. Just not good enough for any beach let alone a tourist place
Manib81,43 contributions,Dec 2016,This place is lovely as a chill out zone but there are way too many stray dogs running around the beach. It's very lively at night and there is great music which is fantastic! Overall it's not that bad but daytime and nighttime there is a huge contrast 
Marie A,5 contributions,Nov 2016,Great to have dinner on the beach and watch the sunset. Bars and restaurants usually close around 11pm on the beach.
Stephen N,"Kinglake, Australia",Dec 2016,"From our hotel on the beach it was well supervised and clean, people were learning to surf, swimming, walking and jogging. Some locals were trying to sell their flying kits shaped like pirate sailing ships"
roy.47,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,Ten minutes leisurely walk from the Marriott where we were staying. Crowded every evening with people socialising and watching the sun set. 
jlovestotravelandeat,"Lympstone, UK",Nov 2016,"Surf is amazing, so is the beach....apart from that is is so dirty and if there is heavy rain the rubbish from Java gets washed up onto the beach. Even had a plastic bag wrap around my leg in the sea! The beach bars are good but the women sellers are persistent and irritating if you are trying to relax. "
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Drop by at a luxury hotel in Seminyak, me and friend taking a look at this beautiful beach, while the nice weather support the beautiful image of the spot. Some people enjoy the beach by little running along the off-shore, some others were having chats, seen kids were swimming."
NiveditaSamanta,98 contributions,May 2016,"It's nice during the day, we walked from Potato Head to KuDeTa and it was fantastic walk! The hawkers can be pesky, but they go away if you say a firm ""no"". "
SoVerySoCal,"Orange County, CA",Nov 2016,"We visited on a November morning, so our view may be a bit skewed. The beach was clean, clear, and empty. We also stopped by Ku De TA for drinks and again, it was relatively empty. Perfect spot for our last day in Bali."
Rajan1951,"Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India",Nov 2016,"The beach is clean. There are few good restaurants on the beach, and the food there is clean, tasty and very reasonably priced."
evrywhere,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"The best way to see this beach is from Potato head. Book your chair and watch the sunset. Eat drink and enjoy. The Sundays have many locals enjoying the beach with their families, so nice to see."
Josor24,"Darwin, Australia",Nov 2016,Average kind of beach. Not really a good place to relax being annoyed by someone selking or offering something. Go to Padawa instead
Nicholas P,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Dark coloured sand means it really heats up, so take thongs with you. Get a good spot and the sunsets are truly breathtaking.My biggest criticism is that neither the tourists or the locals respect the area, so much crash just thrown on the sand, cigarette butts etc...very disappointing."
Kit P,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"Long, wide & colourful beach in the evening. Many colourful bean bags laying around the various beach bars. Enjoyed the warm sea breeze & capturing the sunset. Nice place to take pictures.Many mobile hawkers walking to sell sunglasses, sarong, kites, sky lanterns, etc. After the sunset, i saw many ppl lighting up the sky lanterns as well. "
Paul_Leanne_M1,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2016,Great spots to take in the beautiful sunsets lots of good services and beach clubs but not real nice in terms of cleanlyness of sand etc. Leanne & Paul 
Sandy B,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Seminyak beach is ok, nothing to shout about and you definitely wouldn't come here for the beach. You'd be much better off staying at a nice villa or resort with a good pool. The sunsets are beautiful and you can also surf at different places along the beach but you'll find much better places in the world for a beach. "
Simer B,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2016,"Great for surfing and walks along the beach.amazing sunset, accessible from several hotels in seminyak"
Plam P,16 contributions,Nov 2016,Nice endless beach with beautiful beach and view nice to walk swim surf or just sunbathing. Not crowded 
HungoverTT,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",Nov 2016,Unfortunately seminyak beach is the consequences of over development and tourism. Its hard to balance protecting the environment while trying to get as much tourists in as possible.
MerryRosalin,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Enjoy and relax evening time in Seminyak Beach, feel the ambiance of truly beach... Nice to see the scenery especially in Sunset time, relax and ""me time"""
Izzy M,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Seminyak beach is this huge beautiful stretch of sand with countless spots to stop for a drink or some food while locals come and offer you all sorts of things for sale. I easily visit this area every single day I'm in Bali, because it's got absolutely everything you need"
Richard B,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"some live music and some dance chill out music on the beach, wide selection of people and all age groups also popular for the locals surf is always present and most people do swim in this area"
Jo C,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2016,I did prefer Seminyak Beach 23 years ago..but more to do for tourists now :) Lots of great places to eat or just watch the sunset.
aussieAl_61,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,"I walked down from my accommodation one evening to the beach.It was wide, clean, and not crowded. I enjoyed watching the setting sun, surfers and people walking by."
Vivian L,492 contributions,Nov 2016,I can just sit all day and night at this beach!  The sunset was magnificent and after that was a starry beautiful night!  Lots of bars with live music and it's so relaxing juat chill at one of them for a nice beer or cocktail! 
Jay W,"Montreal, Canada",Nov 2016,Good place for surfing but not good for swimming. Too wavy. Sand is ok. Good for tanning also. Not crowded.

Lynda149,"Auckland, New Zealand",Nov 2016,"Its a very average beach, there are so many bicep beaches along the coast. The sand isn't that nice and theres a fair bit of rubbish around. Lots of vendors trying to sell you stuff constantly. We wouldn't spend a lot of time here, however a walk along the beach is interesting."
Daniel S,"Sollentuna, Sweden",Nov 2016,This is a great beach with a little bit darker sand because of the volcanos. Along the beach you will find the big expensive hotels where you can go for a drink. The only negative thing is for parents is that the water is pretty dangerous here. Big waves and underwater currents.
Taurus_2011,"Reading, UK",Nov 2016,"If you want a big beach with lots to offer this beach did offer a lot. Restaurants and bars everywhere all the way along, the surf is good especially for beginners and although at sunset the beach seemed very busy there was plenty of space to either walk along or chill out on one of the many beanbags. Overall a nice beach. "
Chester W,"London, UK",Nov 2016,"There are some nice hotels / beach clubs set back from the sea front and the beach is large but lacks the intimacy of beaches in other parts of indonesia, such as in the Gili Islands "
Josh F,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach is beautiful. Water is warm, low tide shows the flat sand covered in a thin layer of water reflecting the sunset, worth staying until after dark for the sky lantern ceremonies! Free parking for scooters along the small beach road and renting a beanbag is free with any food or drink (30,000RPI mei goreng / bin tang) "
Eric F,"Antwerp, Belgium",Nov 2016,One of the best places in Bali to watch the sunset.Ku De Ta and Potato Head are hotspots to watch the sunset with some nice food and a drink.
Timmy T,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2016,"If you would like to enjoy a perfect sunset on a budget, I suggest Seminyak Beach over Kuta or Jimbaran as you don't need to spend a lot to enjoy yourselves.There are lots of bars selling cheap beers on the beach. The best thing is that they even have bean bags!"
Rena G,"Nanjing, China",Sep 2016,"Quite crowded.Not very pretty - a bit dirty.Can be good for some water sports - saw people taking beginner's surfing classes, surfing on their own, water ski etc."
DiAplo,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Nov 2016,"Maybe this is the best beach in Bali. I went to all of them and considering the cleanliness, size, and surroundings, in my opinion this is the best. "
Kerstin E,6 contributions,Nov 2016,Do not recommend Seminyak beach. It is under reconstruction with lots of work going on. Choose another beach!
lprisd,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"super crowded with tourists and surfers. daybed are for rent at 100,000rp if you are not at your hotel beach clubs. lots of peddlers selling goods. many that offers surfing lessons. overall, sunset view is great."
Doug S,"Penkridge, UK",Nov 2016,A good sandybeach with plenty of amenities and sun beds to rent. Beware of the rip tide although red flags and lifeguards are about. Beach get cleaned every morning. 
RupaliGurani,50 contributions,Nov 2016,I would like to visit this place every time I come back to Bali. If you want to chill with your friends then this is the place to go. Sadly couldn't experience sunset but I can imagine the beauty it would add to the already beautiful surrounding. 
Tracy S,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Oct 2016,"don't know that I would swim at the beach, ok to walk down, had to walk passed the temple to get access."
Janice T,41 contributions,Nov 2016,"this is a nice beach.....was a little too wavy when we were there in November but good for surfing.  Lots of beach chairs for rent.  Only negative is there a lots of local trying to sell everything......hats, manicure, scarfs, goods, fruit etc.  They are very persistent so beware to keep your head down and if you buy anything then all vendors will be over to visit and try their luck"
Jamie A,33 contributions,Nov 2016,It is nice for sunset but rather busy so I'm sure you will find another beach which is less busy. But good options to relax with lots of bars and chairs 
Dennis V,25 contributions,Oct 2016,"Being Australian and spoiled by our pristine beaches, I still enjoyed an early morning run and/or an afternoon stroll on Seminyak Beach, which was only a short walk from where I was staying. In the evening there was plenty of atmospheric lounging on the beach where you could wine and dine on the many bean bags and listen to great chill out tunes.  "
Kay D,"Glasgow, UK",Oct 2016,"Not my favorite beach.  Lots of people using beach to walk dogs (no problem with that) but not picking up poo (big Problem with that) Long beach and sand gets darker the nearer  the Volcanic ash.  At the entrance I arrived at had bucket with water and ladle to wash your fee,t nice touch.  "
Quentin R,130 contributions,Nov 2016,"During the night all beaches in Seminyak are full of big colorful pillow, each bar has a live band and all cocktail are very cheap!!The atmosphere is awesome.. That was our first activity in Bali.. A nice mojito on the beach, 30 degrees... What else?"
Trevor G,"Browns Plains, Australia",Nov 2016,"This is one of the highlights for us when we have visited Bali. Sitting on a beanbag, watching the sunsets, while enjoying a cold drink from one of the many bars is just so relaxing. The downside is that you get hassled by lots of people trying to sell you sunglasses, hats, watches, paintings, massages, bracelets, manicures, pedicures, bows and arrows, tasers, lazers and all kinds of Knick Knacks. They can be very persistent but generally a polite ""Sorry, no"" is enough and they will move on."
Travelfan353,"Victoria, Canada",Nov 2016,"There are so many great beaches in Bali..give this one a miss if you can. I'm not sure if it was just the time of year that we were there but there were pretty significant waves breaking near the shore that make this beach difficult to actually swim at. If you enjoy body surfing (or actual surfing) and aren't scared of large waves you might like it here. Also the beach had lovely sun loungers set up all along it that you have to pay to use. You could set up on the sand but it's kind of awkward setting up between the loungers and the sand is really hot. The loungers are expensive and while laying on them you are constantly harassed by vendors selling knock off sunglasses, cheap ""jewelry"", and sarongs. The vendors were non stop and really took away from the enjoyment. Bali has tons of quiet white sand beaches with minimal break, I think it's worth it to put in the effort to find one near you instead of Seminyak Beach :)"
aladin s,"Munich, Germany",Nov 2016,very nice beach and busy but not so crowded. many good bars at the beach to enjoy the sunset by a cocktail.
OmG,"Stanmore, UK",Nov 2016,"...Enjoy!The beach and view is similar to most beaches, but unfortunately there isn't my cleaning going on. Sadly there is a lot of people leaving their left over rubbish. This doesn't ruin the whole beach, just the initial walk up. Once you past the small line of rubbish, you forget it was there and the beach is stunning. Great view as you would expect and in November the waves crashing slightly heavier, which makes for a lovely sound and feel. Just be careful as riptide is quite common."
Michah_V,Singapore,Nov 2016,"Not much crowd at this beach, went from 12nn-3:30pm (maybe that's why)The sand is bloody hot so be sure to be in your flip flops at the very least. Tides/waves were 6/10 in strength. Beginner surfing lessons available here so the wave strength is ideal.More private as it's not as famous as Kuta beach for example but this area is where the more pricey accommodations are.If you want to relax and have a tan or enjoy the sunset here, there are beach chairs and umbrellas along the stretch of the beach BUT a payment of 20,000 Rupiah per person is required (approx. USD2).Also, a lot of lovely places to eat facing the sea along this stretch."
RajThind78,"Great Barr, UK",Nov 2016,"The best beach I visited in Bali, both during the day & evening. Offered great food, my favourite was Capil. The hotel i stayed in had there own subbed area. The evening vibe was stunning, places to sit, eat & drink on the beach with live music. "
Tim W,18 contributions,Nov 2016,"Excellent beach for surfing, not an ideal swimming beach as there are strong currents and waves of some reasonable force."
gailw00ds,"Port Lincoln, Australia",May 2016,"This beach is very relaxing with deck chairs you can hire local girls with massage tables and locals selling their wares,Very safe beach and surf boards for hire along with drink"
Helen C,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"I shared tapas with my friend, chicken tacos divine, prawn and avocado good, chicken sate good. Beautiful evening on bean chairs drinking good Australian wine and bintang, watching sunset while the local talent did a good job of 60's - current hits"
mexistu,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",Nov 2016,"This beach is fairly clean but not the best in Bali. There is some trash in places but generally ok. The water is not of the blue kind due to the colour of the sand. Seminyak is a nice lively town full of good bars, restaurants and cafes. This is the heart of the bali gay scene with several gay bars."
CynthiaC1962,"New South Wales, Australia",Oct 2016,"Was excellent for food and reasonable prices and easy picking and friendly staff,beautiful sunsets to veiw and have a drink"
Gemma C,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2016," Beautiful beach with beautiful sunsets . Don't just stay in one place, walk the stretch and check out some of the bars. Can easily enter some of the hotels with poolside bars/infinity pools for no sunbed fee. "
Keb1993,"Rushden, UK",Oct 2016,"from the airport to the hotel,the walk from the hotel to the beach and the beach in general was not my idea of bali and can defiately say I would never retun if I had to stay there a weekour fist sight of the beach was one of a few dogs emptying out and there was rubbish everywhere.On our way back to the hotel, in the main street in a gutter, was a dead cat which looked like it had been there  for days if not a week or more.On return to hotel, we contacted our travel agent and asked to move resort.On research before we came Seminyak was supposed to be up market. NOT in my book.I would return to Bali but not Seminyak"
Mark W,"Barnsley, UK",Oct 2016," I always thought Bali would be a tropical place with nice white sand beaches. It was a ok beach but was very dirty . Dogs allowded to make a mess on beach which put me off walking on the beach with no footwear. was nice at night when hotels lit up and beach parties where in place, Excellent place if you want to surf. But needs a good clean up"
tigger2594,"Toowoomba, Australia",Nov 2016,"Whilst visiting Bali we took a day trip and spent some time at the beach for a cool off.It's a lovely sandy beach with seats and umbrellas for hire you you can just sit on the sand.Very humid on our day but fine and the water was clean. Resorts seem to front the road then the beach.Of course there are vendors for drinks, ice creams etc. new Parkinson g places were being built when we visited.Lovely place to visit, take a swim and relax. A fair amount of people but not crowded."
AlexvBPerthWA,7 contributions,Nov 2016,"Classic long Bali beach.Glorious sunsets, lots of beachside eateries. Clean.Hawkers not too persistent. "
J P,"Nelson Bay, Australia",Nov 2016,"Sorry but dirty and univiting, soo many better beaches in Bali. Horrible sand with bad currents just not nice."
Lizjak10,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2016,Wherever I am in the world I try to do a morning walk before it gets busy. The beach is nice enough despite the uninviting coffee coloured sand. Most days it was a bunch of dog walkers with lots of locals on Sundays.
MarcoCVerde,"Accra, Ghana",Oct 2016,Nice surprise. Clean water. Good waves for surfing and less congested than Kuta beach. A lot of shopping and restaurants behind.
sinthamahardi,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2016,It's great beach to enjoy sunset around south of Bali. The place was really busy in the evening. The kids will love this so much.
heypa138,Hastings,Oct 2016,"The beach is nice, and the water is warm, and it is a great place to learn to surf.  However, there are a dodgy smells and it would be nice to see a bit more care with cleaning up rubbish, etc.  The locals offer goods for sale, but they don't hassle you so that is fine."
Sabes420,17 contributions,Nov 2016,"This is one of the best beaches I've ever seen. Great sunset, lively environment, family friendly, lots of waves if you're a surfer and you can enjoy the dinner right on the beach. "
IngemarG59,"Lule√•, Sweden",Nov 2016,Nice beach with good waves and LOTS of people as it is here.You can find nice food anywhere. Remember sunscreen when u walk around
Ferry J,"Papendrecht, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,A wonderful beach with plenty of room nice waves and a big variety of restaurants and bars. Lay back and relax and enjoy your Holliday! 
Ashleigh S,"Baldivis, Australia",Oct 2016,Great beach. Beautiful sunset. Bean bags. Bintangs. Great people. The Atmosphere is fantastic.. markets.. cocktails.. dinner.. breakfast.
LouisianaChardonnay,"Magnolia, AR",Oct 2016,Great for a long walk or jog with incredible sunsets!  We were fortunate to stay at W retreat and spa beachside for cocktails at the Woobar
Fernando M,4 contributions,Oct 2016,"Nice family waves, surfing is for everyone. Beautiful sunsets and plenty of beach restaurants and Puras."
Sarah M,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Put this place on your must visit list. Have been here numerous times and has never disappointed. Can be busy but worth the wait. 
Fifi L,"London, UK",May 2016,"Beautiful beach, easy to get to from the town, some bars on the beach have bean bags and umbrellas. Lovely sunset :)"
Heidi C,"Bendigo, Australia",Oct 2016,"What a fun place for a drink or 2 on brightly colored beanbags, under colorful umbrella's  on the beach watching the sunset! lots of bars along this strip of beach..find one where u like the music, sit down and enjoy the view. the food was very good at the bars we went to and the cocktails were well priced and delish. The beach is good for a swim and the water was warm."
Sinead D,6 contributions,Oct 2016,The beach in seminyak is nice but the water is very rough and not enjoyablw for swimming. We have seen nicer beaches elsewhere and for the price you pay to stay around here it is not worth it. If you are looking for a beach holiday go to the Gili islands where there are beautiful white sandy beaches and calm clear water. Also it is way cheaper and not half as crowded and if you explore the island you can find your own little private section of beach which is paradise
Thuyette P,8 contributions,Oct 2016,Busy and alive place nighttime to watch the sunset with a cocktail in the hand ... lot of restaurant and bar !
catrine m,1 contribution,Oct 2016,"i went to visit this Beach a few week Ago, so Many rubbish, plastick, bottle and other, this pace it so touristic and not very comfert for relax"
luckyonelol,"Cranleigh, UK",Oct 2016,As beaches go this was very average. Quite a bit of refuse around and very uninspiring.  Bali needs to clean up their beaches or loose all the tourists! 
llmace,"Mooroolbark, Australia",Oct 2016,"Water is warm, locals playing soccer and beautiful sunsets. There are heaps of on the beach casual restaurants. We and drinks where they had  life band and we danced on the beach"
MariMama2019,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2016,We were there for an afternoon and enjoyed a lot. The water was nice and hot and the waves were quite high. Good for who's trying to surf and it's a beginner-intermediate surfer.
rinasingh09,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Oct 2016,Uncluttered and clean. You might have to check into a good property for the towels and sun roof. Was a lovely experience.
Scully1994,Nerang Queensland Australia,Oct 2016,"Great area to view the fabulous sunsets of Bali. Shopping around the area is a wonderful experience with the flavours of Bali ever present, wafting past to lure you into one of the great eating opportunities "
Leanne D,New Zealand,Oct 2016,Atmosphere - music - just perfect - however cleaner toilets are needed - not to good on that situation 
FloranH,"Maastricht, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,"Ok there are more beautiful beaches in the world, with whiter sand and clearer waters ,this is true. But Seminyak has a great spirit to it, it is not overcrowded like Kuta , and you can easily rent boards to enjoy the nice sand waves with the locals. And yes there are many nice beach bars and restaurants as well.."
AnnaDS,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2016,"In a day the beach looked average, not great for sunbathing or swimming due to massive waves, black dirty looking sand. In the evening it transforms into amazing place to sit on the beanbags sipping cocktails and enjoying the sunset while listening to music "
s b,"Dallas, TX",Oct 2016,Lots of cool restaurants and bars with beautiful sunsets!  Water nice and warm with lots of beach to walk up and down to people watch.
Aefwolf,"San Diego, CA",Oct 2016,This is a great beach for a sunset and a drink. The surf is never that great unless you like pitchy fast closeout beach breaks. The vendors can be annoying after a while. A chair should cost you about 50-100K rupiah. Enjoy
Louise W,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Sunset cocktails on Seminyak Beach were stunning!  Such a fun atmosphere each evening as the Sun goes down, music to enjoy and people watching on Bean Bags!!"
Suzie R,"Johns River, Australia",Oct 2016,"Seminyak Beach is a great spot to be in Bali, the area its self has great shopping and restaurants, the beach well, without fail, great sunsets overnight, there are also lots of great hotels here with beach bars to sit in comfort, have a drink and watch the sun go down."
Greg1D,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"A average beach to visit and not as good as Australian beaches. Surf is often dumpers with strong tows, no life guards. Best to paddle in surf to cool off then watch the sunset from La Lucciola Restaurant or Bar area. (excellent Italian food)"
PDAWG17,39 contributions,Oct 2016,Need to watch out for the dam ozzies if you want a swim as they are all surfers. lovely sand and great bars what have music every night bean bags on beach so you can chill out. only thing what could make this place better is a good shroom seller. worth visit
morgandavies,"Rochdale, UK",Oct 2016,Lovely wide beach...great for surfers. Nice sand ... some people hiring out sunbeds are a bit cheeky and really try to mega overcharge. ..but if you are caeful and get the honest ones you will be OK.  Enjoyed this beach. 
mikeswallow01,"Mexborough, UK",Oct 2016,Nice long open beach of a blackish sand.Beach bars available..when we were there the beach was fairly quiet.
Rajesh G,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2016,"Sunset here is mindblowing. The shore turns into a mirror by sunset and you can get some brilliant photos. The shacks here are open for a long time in the night, so never go thirsty (and hungry :P). Currents and waves are too strong. So keep kids away from the sea."
Melanie H,2 contributions,Sep 2016,This is a surfing beach and not a beach for young children as the currents are strong.  However the beach itself is sandy.
Gary T,"Lake Haven, Australia",Oct 2016,Clouds lined the horizon but even this could not stop the rays of the sunset. Wined and dined on the beach while watching the nighty event take place. 
eleblanc,"Oakville, Canada",Oct 2016,Great beach with waves that were great for new surfers and boogie boards.  Was able to rent a boogie board for $5 CDN per day and 2 chairs and umbrella for $15 CDN.  probably could have bargained harder if we were there longer
roshyrosh,London,Sep 2016,"I loved this beach. I was travelling solo for a bit near the end of my trip and would come here everyday for about 2 hours. Yeah you get bothered a bit, but just be assertive with your ""nos"" and they'll leave you alone. The water was pretty wavey when I was there, loads of people were about with their surfboards/ paddle boards. You can rent a beach lounger for about 50,000 if you haggle - otherwise you'll be given a flat rate of 100,000. Great views, soft sand, warm sea. What more do you need?"
Greg H,Airlie Beach,Oct 2016,Good.clean .good surf.close to the main shopping.can hire a surfboardThere are day beds and umbrellas 
iTravel-A2Z,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"Went for drinks at sunset, it was great. Sea is fairly rough and sunloungers are available everywhere"
Steve D,"Kersbrook, Australia",Oct 2016,This was my first time staying in Seminyak having stayed in Kuta and Legian previously. The area is a lot more relaxed than it's southern neighbours. If you are looking for a more chilled out Bali experience this is the place for you. Loved my stay here. 
peter_blythe,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"Seminyak beach is a great spot to visit.Of a day time there are beach side restaurants ,sun lounges to rent ,surfing and just walking is fun.When the sun goes down there is live music and great atmophere sitting on the bean bags on the sand."
Mums4Kids,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"It is a very long beach with clubs and hotels all along it that invite visitors to share facilities. If you are going to swim, watch out for the currents as they can be fierce. Swim within the monitored areas with life guard patrols."
SinkingSeabourn,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Oct 2016,Really pleasing to see the effort to clean up SEMINYAK beach. Lots of small cafes and bars with cheap food and beer. Surfboard hire and recliners are available.
Kyle Brincefield,"New York City, NY",Oct 2016,"Many of Bali's beaches have a lot of coral and rocks, Seminyak is the MOST beautiful, comfortable beach I visited on our 2 week trip. All beaches in Bali are beautiful, but at Seminyak, you can walk out hundreds and hundreds of feet and still touch. I loved that. The sand and beach are so clean and smooth, it was such a nice alternative to all the other rocky beaches surrounding and the Gili Islands. The rocky beaches are great for photos and are beautiful, but sometimes you just want to swim or lounge and not worry about cutting your feet or getting knocked into rocks. Seminyak is perfect for that. We spent days on this beach enjoying every moment of it. Lots of baby crabs at night that sometimes pop out during the day, but it was cute and fun. LOVE THIS BEACH, can't stress enough."
Deanna B,19 contributions,Aug 2016,"One part of bali I really look forward to is heading down to   Seminyak beach to see the sunset. You have so many bars and food to choose from, or just choose from the live music where you want to sit. It always has such a great vibe there. Yes you always get lots of people trying to sell  to you but that is just part of it.   "
DarreninHK,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2016,Plenty going on on the beach. Lots of independent beach bars to choose from or just play on the sand. 
Sandra G,8 contributions,Oct 2016,"The beach is really clean, important in Indonesia, and it's free of surfboards. You can have sunbathe and, of course, jump the waves. It's not good for swimming."
Mankj65,19 contributions,Aug 2016,The Seminyak beach is very crowded with alot of people playing football. But the ambience is prety good. One the best experience that we have is enjoyed the Bakso in the beach. 
Alex Z,Teufen,Oct 2016,"The beach was in front of our hotel (The Oberoi). Not your white sand dream beach but great to kill a few hours. The waves and currents are quite strong (careful when bathing with little kids), ideal to take your first surf lessons. The water temperature is fantastic, we've stayed in the water for hours. Water and beach were reasonably clean."
Janeric66,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2016,Filthy water the beach is smelly as the sewage water runs stright in to the ocean from the drains running along the street even the hotels toilets come out in the water on seminyak beach...
RamblingRahul,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2016,A long stretch of beach with beach huts where the road from Seminyak ends at the beach. A small red-flag section frequented by surfers.
Yong T,Ampang ,Oct 2016,Seminyak beach located next to / after Legian beach which is perfect not too busy crowded beach stretch after Kuta. Still with perfect sunset view as well as nice beach stretch for swim surf tanning. Nearby resort hotel stay various with standard and one of it is GrandMas hotel with affordable rate and walking distance less than 5 minutes to Seminyak beach. Convenient location with convenient stores and restaurant.
ammaus n,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2016,"I personally don't swim in this beach due to the surf but its lovely to walk along in the mornings, especially on Sundays when the locals are out with their families.  The sun sets are also amazing.  The locals keep it relatively clean and there are a lot of great restaurants ranging in cost along the way."
Rouge_fairy,"Makati, Philippines",Oct 2016,"It's a long stretch of beach, great spot to just take in the view but full of trash. Cigarette butts and plastic everywhere. Waves are pretty strong so never leave your kids unattended. "
lynton1,"Cape Town, South Africa",Sep 2016,"This is a wonderful beach with some of the best sunsets one could imagine. The surf is good, the people friendly and there's Ku De Ta for a cold beer, a pizza or a wonderful meal. I want to go basck!"
Paula B,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"Nice beach, not the best but the location is great with a lot of beachside restaurants and bars (limited vegetarian options and they all seem to have pretty much the same menu).  Week-ends tend to be very crowded.  You can rent chairs, take leisurely walk, swim in designated area (others have big under current)."
Galina R,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2015,"Seminyak beach was just 5 minutes walk from our hotel.The beach is wide and long. There is plenty of space for everyone without felling crowded.We enjoyed some of the most beautiful sunsets here.There are a lot of restaurants, pubs and lounges which you can enjoy for lunch during the day or for a party in the evening.The waves were great. We are not surfers but we still had our fare share of fun. It was a bit of a mission to find a peaceful and quiet spot on the beach where you can relax and don't have to listen to few different kinds of music at the same time.I only have a humble request to some of the dog owners to be considerate and clean after their pets while walking them on the beach.  "
Extraordinary525718,12 contributions,Oct 2016,Nice beach but be prepared for dark volcanic ash sand. The surf looks great for beginners through to advanced. Nice at night also when all lit up for a few drinks on the beach.
Andowhite,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,We went the beach everyday during our two week stay ... Beach was beautiful however very crowed and busy ... It's very busy as lots of hotels close by and shops ... Lots of places to eat and drink nearby ... Beach was very clean and inviting for a swim 
Bellalubliss,Geelong,Jun 2016,It's not a bad beach but certainly not the cleanest which is such a shame. A lot of drains go straight into the ocean and you see a lot of rubbish. You can rent chairs there and be sold jewellery from your beach towel if that's what you are after. Head further north for better beaches.
Marko G,"Las Vegas, NV",Oct 2016,"Good waves, strong undertow. Sand is darker volcanic. Long beach for jogging or walks. Plenty of beach clubs along the way."
Andre B,"Bangkok, Thailand",Oct 2016,"Enjoying this beach for the last 2 days already and still have some more days to go. Only note, the waves are quit high and strong. Don't let your children go out too far in the sea.  "
JaneHalliday,"Phillip Island, Australia",Oct 2016,"Tonight I was very desalinated with the taxi drivers at the beach entrance . I had a injured leg with Stitches and couldn't walk very far. I approached 3 taxi drivers fwo wanted to charge me 500.000 Rp to drive me 400mt to my villa. You have got to be kidding me! One driver was so rude, disrespectful and foul!  Even made boo noises after me. Being an Aussie I soon told him where to go and what to do when he got there!!!I have never been treated like that here in Seminyak , I have been hear numerous times and feel very disappointed . Blue bird taxi drivers are usually very nice. "
greytokyo,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2016,"We paid 100,000 IDR for 2 lounge chairs and 50,000 for a body board.  Had a fun day out with everything within reach - coconuts, cold beers, fresh juice, food.  There were also a handful of vendors walking around trying to sell postcards, sarongs, and fruits.  No one offered massages though, strangely.  A word of caution - don't underestimate the waves.  We saw a number of adults (that's right, not kids) bobbing up and down and moving further and further away from the shore.  3 had to be rescued in one afternoon as they just couldn't swim back.   A tip - we saw surf guards on the beachfront of the Anantara Hotel."
Nae79,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"Gorgeous beach with amazing sunsets! Was very clean, not ridiculously busy, absolutely beautiful and if i could watch sunsets from there every day it would be heaven! "
SandraLara1980,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Seminyak beach is okay and good for long walks but it is not very clean. Also the hawkers selling all kinds of things can be too persistent and lounging on a sunbed reading a book can be a big challenge. They constantly approach the tourists even if you say no many times.
psychey,Sydney,Oct 2016,"Great waves... good for jumping around in it. Beware of beach benches that people flog out for IDR100,000 per bench. You may think it belongs to the hotel, but they don't. Also the sand is extremely hot when you step in it during mid-day. Scorching. Have to wear footwear."
Kunaskun,Jakarta,Oct 2016,"It feels like in Kuta or Jimbaran. Will be jammed in high season. Plus things, because it's Hotspot so easier to reach, many type of rentable beach stuff are available such as umbrella, bean bags, etc. "
Shelle123,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"As far as beaches go it was ok, not busy, only at occasional patches where there were bar shacks üòÑ there are no trees or bushes/shrubs. Hardly any sellers driving you mad. Too rough to swim with huge big waves and swell, so it's great if your a confident surfer but if not then you had better stay safe and stick to having a paddle lol lovely for a stroll in the evening or watching people setting off the candle/glow lanterns into the night sky üòò"
Barbara W,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2016,"This beach is very long. We did not walk right up to the surfers part but could see surfers on the waves. Not far from where we came onto the beach we hired clean loungers and an umbrella. 200000for the day or 150000 for three hours for the two loungers and umbrella. The waves were fun and the water warm. Further along were hotels with all their umbrellas and loungers, overlooking the beach. The sunsets were beautiful."
Kawkawa,"Vernon, Canada",Oct 2016,Used Seminyak Beach several times during our stay.. beach loungers and umbrellas can be rented as well as water toys boogie boards surf boards etc... nice place to swim and play
stephanie b,51 contributions,Oct 2016,Do you want to swim in trash? If not then stick to the pool in your hotel. This beach is gross. We preferred batu belig further up  however it still had rubbish floating in it and lots of broken glass on the beach. Unless you are desperate to swim in the surf don't do it.  However the many warungs on the beach are a nice place to sit and view the surf (without trying to swim in it) 
dmw69,"Newcastle, Australia",Oct 2016,"A nice beach to look at especially at sunset, but you can smell the sewage flowing into the ocean via the creeks/outlets along the beach. I shudder to think what you would be swimming in. So we didn't swim at all."
Daniel S,1 contribution,Oct 2016,"The beach is very nice, a good place for sun rise and sun set. Watching sun set with a cup of drink in the nervy restaurant maybe one of your best choices in this spot"
BernieBrown,"London, UK",Oct 2016,"Seminyak beach is beautiful, amazing for surfing (not that I even attempted to) but to hear the waves crashing while lying on the sun bed is so relaxing.It's not the best beach to visit along this coast line but still, if staying in Seminyak, it's certainly worth a visit"
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"Coming at this beach for more than 30 years and it's always super.. the waves are great and the sun is always good. It's near Dyanapura street with lots of warung, restaurants and shops."
Kim O,Cardiff,Nov 2015,We enjoyed a couple of lazy days on this beach with our teenage children.  Plenty of little warungs to eat and drink at and cheap surf board hire.
Dennis T,"Sligo, Ireland",Oct 2016,"Very long stretch of the beach with nice waves, lots of surf schools along the way, bars with nice comfy seats, and just plenty of room for walking/jogging. Not really for swimming, but we still did :-P Nice place"
jewel57,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,Relaxing night sitting on beanbags Only thing was we got hassled a bit by hawkers Great to enjoy sunset cocktails and music 
Annie M,"South Australia, Australia",Oct 2016,A bit too much waves for me but nice for walking and relaxing watching and lovely sunsets - all good 
whitey09,melbourne,Oct 2016,Can can be as energetic as you want here. Either swim surf go for a run or just laze back in a bean bag and watch the sunset
Masego M,"Centurion, South Africa",Oct 2016,the beach was a short walk from our hotel. it is very clean and goes on for miles. the water is very pleasant and are able to swim and surf freely. there are plenty of beach umbrellas to hire so u can lazy around and enjoy the view 
Jean L,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,This beach is definitely not for swimming!  But it's fun to hang out on!! You'll find many people walking along the beach. 
Flashpacker08,"San Diego, CA",Sep 2016,"stroll down the beach, grab a beanbag at sunset, a cool beverage of choice and kick back and listen to the live music and bands... a great spot for a sundowner"
Monika T,9 contributions,Oct 2016,Great for sunset drinks but that's it. Water is disgusting so don't swim. Cocktails and food is average but vibe is nice.
MarinoTeMoana,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2016,La plancha was amazing I had my sister and grand daughter the food and beach experience was unforgettable a must to do especially a special memory with family watching a gorgeous sunset thank you Bali beach
Chad M,perth,Sep 2016,"The beach is great during the day for surfing and swimming, you can rent an umbrella and lounge. There are plenty of cheap restaurants and food and drink vendors.From about 5.30 onwards the restaurants bring out bean bags and you can sit back and watch the sunset. Most of the bars have music and some have live music. "
StephChapple,"South West Rocks, Australia",Oct 2016,"The beach it's self isn't the cleanest (as with most of Bali). There is a lot of rubbish but otherwise there are lots of chairs to hire for the day, people selling snacks and drinks. Lovely spot to catch a sunset and join in on a game of beach soccer with the locals. "
diaozhadelaowai,18 contributions,Oct 2016,"Not nearly as dirty and disgusting as Kuta beach. Not as nice and calming as Jimbaran beach. Annoying hawkers every 2 minutes and expensive beach chairs (prices quoted to us ranged from 150,000 for all day to 150,000 for 2 hours).The waves here are good for surfing. Not practical for unsupervised children.If you stay nearby and have already been to Jimbaran beach, it's worthwhile."
bhatku101,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,We went to the beach the day we landed in Bali . We had walked quite a bit and were very tired and thirsty. We sat down at one of the many places offering drinks and a bite to eat . They were playing some nice music. What we found unique was that part of the seating was bean bags and we really relaxed and enjoyed the evening with drinks and some snacks and found our exhaustion vanishing.
PHDSydney_Australia,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach is pretty ordinary, a long wide beach only fit if you hire a sun lounge. There are lots of much better places to surf in Bali"
Leila_lj,"London, UK",Oct 2016,"Very busy, too much for my liking. And the sea is rough, which is to be expected. Great for surfers, not so much for peaceful swims "
ShezM,"Narre Warren, Australia",Sep 2016,"Long length of beach to wander down with plenty of surf schools, restaurants and sunlounges (although you pay for the lounges) Take your own towel!"
Vipul556,"Mussoorie, India",Oct 2016,"If you just want to sit and relax by the beach at the night with multiple Shacks and good music playing, this is the place to be in Bali.. Go over there and try any of the many places that you'll find.. All have almost the same prices and menu and music playing "
AMSCAN16,United Kingdom,Oct 2016,Visited briefly and had a good time! Like any beach in Bali you will get asked every 5 mins surprise to buy goods! 
Michael R,"Maidstone, UK",Oct 2016,"Iconic beach, no white sands. A lot of vendors bothering you.Not entirely clean, seen better beaches, quite touristy. Untidy beanbags. Roaming dogs.In general ok, good for young people, noisy and a lot of Australians.Must not forget Bali/Indonesia is a relatively poor country. I am pleased for the locals that tourism brings much needed revenue. On the whole enjoyable but with some reservations."
Sam,"Weymouth, UK",Oct 2016,"We parked up our rented moped at this beach right next to the Anantara hotel just after 9.30am, put our towels down in the beach, swam, walked, sunbathed etc. It came to lunchtime so we got back on the moped to find somewhere to eat. As we were getting in the moped 2 locals came up to us saying we have to pay for parking (there were no signs, no barriers and these guys weren't wearing anything official they just had some yellow paper that had 'parking 2000 rupiah' typed on them. We said we were leaving now anyway and that there are no signs and no one was here when we parked up so started to leave, thy kept shouting at us and started swearing ""**** you!"" Considering how lovely and friendly the Balinese people are I was really worried and concerned by the whole experience. At double six beach (where we opted to go after this incident) there is a proper barrier and booth with guys who take the parking charge so that is fine, but who these guys were I have no idea. Horrible experience."
sunshine_sj,"Boston, MA",Oct 2016,I went there for jogging early in the morning. Trashes and smells. I didn't want to dip myself in it. You should have your private pool instead of beach. 
684ma,"London, UK",Sep 2016,"The beach wasn't very clean when we went, not too overly crowded which is a good thing but the tides are very strong so can't really go in for a swim "
Jennifer R,6 contributions,Sep 2016,We headed down after a tough day of shopping and secured comfy beanbags and a first row seat for a pink hazy warm sunset.  Drinks and chatter and the evening grew darkGreat way to finish the busy part of the day.
tarun g,7 contributions,Sep 2016,This is good beach with lot of tourist. Potato house club on this beach is perfect experience. You can have dinner drinks dance pool on potato house club .
AlbertoMay,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",Sep 2016,Its hard not to like a beach.  The beach is average compared to other beaches in the world. Dark lava sand and just makes this beach not pretty.
LKaur123,"London, UK",Nov 2015,"If in Bali, this beach is definitely definitely worth a visit. Especially at sunset- it is gorgeous. It felt safe and could spend hours there. Also lotsOf places to eat nearby and activities. "
BenWha9,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"While it may not be the best beach around it was certainly a fantastic experience to sit on a bean bag chair, sipping a cool bintang and watching the sunset over the ocean."
Sandy A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"biking about 30 minutes to the beach in the morning, it's quite refreshing. the beach is clean and tempting"
70Aussie,"South Australia, Australia",Sep 2016,"I enjoyed a nice walk along the beach , the waves were very strong now I know why most surf. Refreshing when its so hot."
Prakash M,"Cheltenham, UK",Oct 2016,"Clean beach with lots of sun beds. Surfing facilities offered by many. There are the usual hawkers selling watches, hats, sarongs etc. They don't pester so not really a big problem unlike other countries."
andrewdP1107WC,3 contributions,Sep 2016,"When so close to so many amazing beaches... Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia....  seminyak just doesn't live up to the same standard... no White Sands fringed with palm trees... I'd prefer to enjoy elsewhere"
mcscmsdj,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"I've travelled a lot and I don't have much to say about this.. It's a nice beach but it's nothing special.. Views at sunset are amazing and if you surf then I guess you'd rate it more but for me, it's just a beach."
Louise R,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2016,Dirty and not the type of beach that makes you happy to be on.  The beach itself is great but the sand is so dirty and so much rubbish is washed up and not very appealing. Would be a great beach if it was cleaner.
Helen Y,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"It is an experience to sit on a bean bag under the cute little umbrellas and watch the sunset.  If you are going to Bali, do this."
Hulleman1234,"London, UK",Sep 2016,wonderful clean beach but the water is rough for children or elderly people to swim in.  Plenty of activity on the beach but not crowded - we were there in September.
hopkinstownboy,"Pontypridd, UK",Sep 2016,Visit at sunset when the beach is covered with bean bags with good music and waiter service for food and drinks.
Jessika H,"White Rock, Canada",Sep 2016,"I wanted to see the colourful umbrellas and bean bag chairs and when the taxi dropped me off I didn't see them. I was initially disappointed but soon found out that they put them away every night and only start putting them back out again around 3pm. My recommendation is to find one of the cafes that you like, grab a bean bag, have a drink and enjoy the view! Beautiful waves there with a strong rip tide so be careful but enjoy the water too! "
birdcrazy89,"Tasmania, Australia",Sep 2016,"Beautiful beach, plenty to do and see. There is surfboard hire scattered all along the beach, and plenty of sick waves to use them on. There are beanbags also scattered all along the beach for people to use, these do come at a cost from what i saw. The bean bags belong to the bars along the bars on the beach, so i believe you just but a drink or something. These beanbags and sheltered by fairy lights, and umbrellas. There is also live music. It really is the perfect place just to kick back and have a few drinks.  "
Jessie Z,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"We went to the beach through Potato Head bar. I love blue sea, but Seminyak beach is a bit grey. A bit disappointed."
Tony B,"Wokingham, UK",Sep 2016,"Having been to the beaches north of Seminyak, these was spotless and has obviously been well looked after. "
Wendy H,"Invercargill, New Zealand",Aug 2016,"Amazing experience, lively colours, bargains, music, warm summer breeze, dinner and drinks in sunset set"
Tim09322,"Maroochydore, Australia",Sep 2016,"Dirty, filthy, disgusting, rubbish and a line of cigarette buts from the beach to the ocean as well as a filthy stream smelling like diarrhoea emptying straight into the sea, and that was the good bit."
Rosemary S,11 contributions,Sep 2016,Love Seminyak beach. Lots of charming restaurants on the beach and classy ones on the street if we wanted something more upmarket. Loved Double 6 rooftop bar
yialli,"Greater London, UK",Sep 2016,"Really beautiful at sunset, beds or towel on sand in the day, clean, amenities like food and beer nearby, nice beach. Swimming fine if you don't go out too much. Further out there are big waves and surf, good for surfing and learning though it's hard to get out and it's not the easiest of beaches, there are danger points and you should be a good swimmer as the currents are strong. Overall a lovely beach, sun, food, drinks, umbrellas and beds if you want, fun in the water, what else do you need? More at commonsensible.org"
207aja,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2016,"Access to the beach is tricky due to presence of all the beach-front hotels and lack of sign-posts (don't rely too much on directions given by hotel staff). The beach was fairly clean and I didn't see any seaweed (presumably as the sea is too rough). The waves were quite strong - and a few people were surfing and body-boarding. There was a small number of traders selling kites, clothing, etc. - though we didn't get any hassle. We paid 150K Rp. for a parasol and two loungers for two hours (initially quoted 250K Rp.). A taxi back to the hotel (1.3 km.) cost 40K Rp)."
kamakshi j,"New Delhi, India",Sep 2016,"Although a tad crowded, this place is just perfect for travellers..we didn't engage in any water sports but the sight is delightful"
Rajat Chakraborty,"Nagpur, India",Sep 2016,"This beach is good to visit during early mornings. The tides just prepare to rise and the beach is filled up with joggers. You can go for an early morning surfing classes here. The beach starts getting crowded from 09:00 am onwards. The coastline is smaller, though, and I presume it has lot of rip tides and the flags line up at several points on the beach. Be advised when you are a surfing beginner."
Anand1351,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"Excellent for viewing Sunset, nice darkish Sand which is comfortable for walking miles. Waves are strong so can't swim. Not crowded and no street vendors to hassle. A very relaxing place, plenty of sunbeds available."
fannyhansen,Sweden,Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach has its nice spots, but it has mostly turned into a tourist spot. Living in Australia I'm used to beautiful beaches, and to be honest Seminyak is pretty dirty. Waves are good for beginner surfers though, and it's easy to get here. "
Michael2810,"Hampton, Australia",Sep 2016,"When the tide is out this is a good beach to walk along. There are the usual beach sellers every so often. Whilst the water looks inviting, it is very dangerous for swimmers so stick to your hotel pool. "
selwyn a,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach is highly overrated . Not clean & strong rips . Pleasant enough to walk along or view but don't go in the water. Busy , noisy & lots of vendors hassling you as you walk . Sanur , Jimbaran & Nusa Dua are much nicer & cleaner   "
Chrise000,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Sep 2016,"We were constantly hounded by taxes & people selling stuff. Scooters made walking around Seminyak dangerous & completely unsafe, was pretty scared."
Shamroze Z,9 contributions,Sep 2016,"Seminyak is your typical beach except its not as crowded as Kuta Beach. Vendors do come up to you to buy stuff, but if you say no nicely they dont linger around. The water is very clean and its lovely to go for a dip :) "
LucasBrad,"London, UK",Sep 2016,Great beach that we were able to spend all day on quite happily.Pay 100 IDR for the double sunbeds for all day - they are so comfy!
Morena L,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"Beautiful and relaxing for a walk, listening to the ocean and then looking at an amazing sunset. What a way to finish the day."
Leanne E,"Melbourne, FL",Sep 2016,"I was disappointed with the beach for swimming- bit rough strong under currents and rips- looked quite dangerous. Learn to surfers seemed to enjoy it.This aside, wonderful to sit by the beach and watch and listen to the crashing waves. Wonderful night spot to sit out in a beanbag with a quiet drink and live music listening to the surf. One of the best things I did on my trip to Bali. Understand beautiful explored parasols and lanterns- great memory"
AmiteshPatro,Bhubaneshwar,Jun 2016,Enjoy the Sun n Sands...Loads of Joints to chill and have a blast...stone Throw distance from one to the other.HAve a blast here. Would rate this second to the beaches of Nusa Dua.
YoussefAbdalla,"Alexandria, Egypt",Sep 2016,"in September their is a lot of surfers , the beach is not very good for swimming but the restaurant on the beach are very nice especially on sunset , you could sit and eat and drink and enjoy the view"
TomJohnston52,"Edinburgh, UK",Sep 2016,"On Bali's west coast this is a dramatic stretch of beach, with a lot of quality hotels behind. It is in contrast to Kuta to the south, which is more raucous. Good surfing for beginners, if that's your thing. We went for a good hour's walk every morning, and were often back in the evening for a sundowner while watching the spectacular sunsets. There is a temple at the Petitenget end and you will often witness religious ceremonies and music of various types. I wouldn't bring kids to Bali for a beach holiday, as the sun is just too strong. With a decent base tan when we arrived, there were one or two days when we were a bit red at the end, even after a walk on a rare cloudy morning. Subject to that, this is a wonderful place. Work continues to tidy up the surroundings. We wouldn't have missed our daily fix."
Grant B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"We went down to the beach today to take advantage of our Hotels Beach Club facilities and I would recommend if you are staying at the Haven Hotel whilst in Bali to utilise this facility.The beach itself offers a great chance to body surf , board ride or boogie board as there was a constant wave.The beach is for those with medium to above swimming skills because the surf is quite powerful and there at times is a strong undertow and rip which could trouble those with not so good swimming skills."
Lena S,32 contributions,Sep 2016,"This beach is clean and beautiful! We loved coming here to walk around and swim. The waves can be a big strong and the lifeguards won't always let you swim, but you can always get your feet wet in the warm water. "
Jonas √òrnes A,"Oslo, Norway",Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach is beautiful and stretches for several kilometers. It is quite clean and have nice sand. It is also quiet compared to other beaches in Bali, but you can still rent sun beds and umbrellas. Many resorts are located along the beach, and at night there's some bars putting out tables and chairs. Make sure to visit La Plancha. The beach is not good for swimming though. The currents are too strong, so you shouldn't really swim here. That is too bad. But beautiful beach. "
BaheyaZeitoun,"Cairo Governorate, Egypt",Aug 2016,"The beach is suitable for surfers, swimmers and tanners. While it is best suited for surfers, because of it's high waves, I thoroughly enjoyed swimming through the waves instead. There are several small restaurants along the beach, as well as local venders, henna artists and masseuses. Topped off with soft black-ish sand and a strong Balinese sun, this beach is worth a visit if you're staying in or near Seminyak."
Wayne495,"Balclutha, New Zealand",Sep 2016,Beautiful beach nice sand but very little shelter no chairs like Kuta and the sea was to rough in the two weeks we were there to swim during the day we wold end up getting a cab to Kuta or in the pool at potatoe head if you could fit
Scho1e,"Cambridge, UK",Sep 2016,"I am indifferent about Seminyak beach, if your looking for a nice quiet white sand beach that you want to relax on and get some sun, then it's not for you, try looking elsewhere in Bali. There is a lovely spot outside the Oberoi that is quiet as they ban loungers and parasols. At sunset the view is amazing and we have been a few times to watch it. It's fun watching the surfers and the people watching etc. You can't swim in the seas as its too dangerous and you will be pulled in by lifeguards. There is plenty to do, ku de ta is buzzing and looks like a good place to chill and drink with music. Weekend was rammed with locals and tourists, but there is enough quiet spots if you look for them"
Coral S,Brisbane,Sep 2016,Loved the freedom of being a short walk to sea.    Lots of people enjoying beach and sea swimming.   Lounge beds available if you want and drinks
Julian S,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"We enjoyed the view of Seminyak beach from the Legian hotel.Pros - warm water, not to many hawkers, sand dark but not black sand as we know it, felt safeCons - rubbish on the beach, some stray dogs which were easily avoided, streams flowing to sea across beach smelly, surf too rough when we were there to swimLooked fantastic from the hotel pool but wasn't a swimming option for us."
zpclan,"Quebec City, Canada",Sep 2016,"Nice clean beach, lot of people and warungs, big waves, nice spot to learn surf. Nice sand. Easy access and free. Some itinerant sellers."
BodhiZephyer,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2016,Our hotel was situated on the beach. The waves were pretty awesome most of the time so if you're not experienced with beaches than its best to stay in shallow water. The sand is very black and you end up with dirty feet. There's heaps of dogs so obviously they urinate and poop on the beach (we saw this happen a bit) so you need to be careful when you're walking. The local people have lounges that you can rent during the day and beanbags at night. There are lots of people coming up to you and trying to sell you things so it's not overly relaxing. There's always places to rent boards from or learn to surf and places where you can get a drink of you want. The beach isn't very clean and there's lots of rubbish and offerings floating/blowing around. The beaches are ok if you've never experienced beaches but if you've been lucky enough to come from a country or area where the beaches are clean with white sand you won't be very impressed. 
Andrewpence917,"San Jose, CA",Sep 2016,"The beach was absolutely beautiful! We arrived just as the sun was setting. My biggest complaint was the amount of people on the beach. Couldn't walk in any particular direction, had to zigzag the whole time. Also, you had to cross a small stream to get onto the beach, which was awkward. "
Ellie_homer1,"Chipping Norton, UK",Sep 2016,"Fabulous beach for cooling off with a nice walk along the shore.. the waves are huge and not really an ideal swimming beach, however it is still beautiful and definitely worth walking. There are a few sewage spot which are not very nice but overall its beautiful!!!"
angdavieds72,5 contributions,Aug 2016,"A very quirky beach once you get past the main drag of people, theirs always going to be people selling products but they're all friendly people!"
eegeckil,"Nizwa, Oman",Sep 2016,"If you wanna do beach bumming then this beach is excellent for that. Have a beer at one of the bars on the beach, listen to the sound of the waves. But don't dream about swimming."
juvinsee,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2016,"Seminyak Beach offers great sunset views. Coupled with so many beach bars along the whole stretch, we had an amazing time just cradling our beers on the colourful bean bags on the beach on one of our nights in Bali. The waves were good for surfers too! Will definitely come to Seminyak Beach again."
Kaatkins1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2016,"Beautiful beach with loads of chilled out beach bars offering live djs, music and dancers. Drinks are reasonably priced and sunsets to die for.  Perfect for surfers and great fun for everybody else."
Timmi002,"Washington DC, DC",Jul 2016,"Great people watching here.  Tons of places to rent chairs and umbrellas, get a beer or some food.  If you want peace and quiet this isn't the place for you as there are tons of locals selling selfie sticks, sarongs, sunglasses, you name it.  After saying no once they will keep coming back thinking that you might have changed your mind in the 15 minutes that they were away from you :-)  The surf is amazing.  As the tide goes out in the afternoon the beach expands and you can go way out and the water will only be at your ankles.  This is also the place to be nighttime as at sunset it gets crowded with people hanging out at bars and restos on bean bags, having cocktails and taking selfies.  Then after sunset it takes on a more club feel with cool music and just a very relaxed Bali vibe.  "
chrisandann2016,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Sep 2016,Stopped at the Juice Bar for a drink and a bite to eat. Lots to watch on the beach with good waves for the surfers. Usual vendors along the beach. Water was warm but a lot of the beach is too rough for swimming. Great beach to wander along.
Terry S,"Nottingham, UK",Sep 2016,The beach at Seminyak is busy with access to the sea front hotels and the other accommodations with clear access offering beach front bars and places to eat suitable for all. The sea is well suited for surfers but during periods of the day also suitable for swimmers as long as they abide by notices and do not venture out too far.The sunset views over the beach are amazing with the waves crashing and the reflections from the setting sun shown up n the shallow waters.A must to see if you are in this area.
MissYou89,7 contributions,Sep 2016,Nice place to get Beer or chilling while see the sunset. Some good and cheap restaurant around.  Kinda busy
robirob15,"Berlin, Germany",Sep 2016,"It may not be as nice as some of the white beaches in the south of Bali and you will never be alone here, but for families this is a good beach to relax, with food, massages, drinks and everything you need at hand. There are no rocks in the water, just watch the current during outgoing tide.The surf is good for beginners, so a nice place to have a lesson. On good days the waves can be good even for more advanced surfers, but chances are you'll find more quality breaks further south or west..."
kladdkaka,"Stockholm, Sweden",Sep 2016,"With all the luxury resorts, i expected more. To windy to relax. To dirty to enjoy a dip. General garbage and small plastic balls (frigolit). Kuta is so much nicer actually."
jancomark,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2016,Nice place to cool down in the evening at the lounge bars along the beach.. Grab some bites with a cold drink and enjoy. 
Helen K,"London, UK",Sep 2016,Spent the afternoon and evening on the beach here and had an amazing time. Sea is ideal for surfers so the water is a bit rough with plenty of waves but had so much fun in the water. Came here specifically for the sunset on the beach and we weren't disappointed! Beanbags are brought out late afternoon for you to relax and enjoy a drink while you watch. This beach gets a massive thumbs up from me. üëçüèª
willi h,chonburi,Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach is really nice,perfect for long walks. Unfortunately the waves were very strong, swimming practically impossible."
VFL74,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2016,We enjoyed walking along the beachParts were dirty but I was expecting a lot worseClean in the morning and outside the most of the hotels
Veniese W,30 contributions,Sep 2016,"The beach has just enough people to be a great place for people watching, but not so many that you fee crowd in any way. The ladies and gentlemen selling their goods along the beach are not too agressive and who doesn't want to enjoy a mango or pineapple.The beachbeds are comfortable and placed apart in a very desirable distance. The shoreline is evasive...you have walk out a distance to get any depth. This was by far my most relaxing beach experience in a long time. The bars that surround the beach have a great variety of food and beverages to enhance your beach bumming."
Alfian Dakhi,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2016,A place that is really good for sunbathing during the day and for chilling during the night. The beach has a lot of restaurants by the beach with live music that you can choose.
Ms_Chona,"Cagayan de Oro, Philippines",Sep 2016,"Waves can be large so its not great for swimming. Best thing to do is rent a chair (around 200,000 for two) and umbrella to watch the sun set. Not too many tourists and it is very relaxing. Dog walkers and joggers also around"
katherine l,"Clinton, Australia",Sep 2016,The beach was not too busy on the day we visited. We did not go to Bali to visit beaches but we thought we should at least have a look. The beach was beautiful and clean and you could clearly see where to swim between the flags. i did not go in as i was terrified by the waves but lots of others were swimming. We did not get hassled on the beach and there was no one selling stuff which was nice.
Brooke G,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"The beach has lots of entertainment, nice bars and restaurants. The beach itself is ok, apart from the sewage streams that trickles down into the sea. It wasn't pleasant having to walk through them as you go along the beach front.. It smelt terrible and you couldn't help but think you're walking through **** Apart from that, the beach is big, has lots of places to sunbathe and is apparently great for surfing (the sea is quite rough) "
85RG,41 contributions,Sep 2016,"Its a must do. Relaxing, clean, people are really nice and the bars stay open until late with no problem serving you in your beach gear!"
PurviPatel1991,"Greater London, UK",Jun 2016,"I stayed in Seminayak in end of June, I found that this beach was very quiet compare to Kuta beach. It's very clean and have some great bars near by."
Kristen N,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"Absolutely beautiful. A must-visit especially for sunset (starts around 5.30pm local time). Plenty of beach bars available for beers. Beware of touting tho, and prices here can be slightly elevated as compared to what you get elsewhere. Afterall, this is a tourist spot."
noosadoer,"Noosa Heads, Australia",Sep 2016,"Coming from Australia we are spoilt for beach choices and certainly used to the surf. Seminyak is rough, with a really strong undertow. Do not swim alone here."
Blossom S,"Arzignano, Italy",Sep 2016,Less crowded compare with Kuta beach and For sure Don't miss watch the Sunset in Seminyak Beach if the weather are good it's So beautiful... 
Somi2013,"Madikeri, India",Sep 2016,We stayed in Destiny which was 10 mins walk from the beach. The beach is nice and waves are quiet strong. We loved the array of restaurants there with live music and bean bags. We just relaxed and took some pics. I was with my 1 year old so just ordered french fries and pina colada. Its great for people who want to have party time with chilled beer.  
Lalx154,"Quito, Ecuador",Sep 2016,"Surfing for beginners, ideal lounging on the beach, cheap beer from same sun bed person. Sun beds go for 100,000 though I chose to pay 50,000 for 2 hours as I didnt plan to stay there that long. Swimming is for people who enjoy tall waves."
CheeKianWing,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"The Seminyak Beach has several things going for it: fine sand, a deep beachfront and non-overcrowding (unlike Kuta). However, the main drawback is that there is little else in the way of things to do. No snorkeling, no diving, no surfing etc.One hour is more than sufficient for this beach."
chooho1124,"Seoul, South Korea",Sep 2016,"Great beach not crowded by tourists. More serene and peaceful. I stayed in Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa, and it was beyond my expectations with very warm, accommodating, and professional staffs as well as beauuuuutiful facilities. "
KLMabb,perth,Sep 2016,Loved the walks along the Seminyak beach. It's large and wide and you can stroll along the upmarket big hotels. Lots of security and also beach chairs available. Don't miss it. Sunsets are stunning.
Ricky F,5 contributions,Sep 2016,Bear in mind a lot of sunbeds incur a charge and it may be better to sit at a beach bar and get a drink and a free seat included.
Gabriela S,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"While in Seminyak for a short holiday visiting the beach was a must. Awesome sunset, live bands all along the beach, fresh grilled corn knobs and boiled peanuts absolutely delicious. It was hard to choose from the many inviting places to have a meal. Ended up at D'Goglo. Yummy food eaten on small table and bean bags on the beach. Loved it."
Veronica G,"Eltham, Australia",Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach is a premier location to relax and enjoy the mix of sands,  sea,  surf and nightlife in Bali.  Hawkers are friendly and not overly intrusive; an inevitable part off tourist culture. Lots of food on offer and they live music is a treat;   from soft rock to folk to blues,  old school festival feel with the sounds of the rhythmic pounding of the surf only metres away. Fantastic sunsets perfect the scene. Like all good parties it comes to an end with the resulting mess on show at daybreak,  to be swept up ready for the next party to begin. "
GlennieB469,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,It was an overcast day when we ventured out but it was peaceful enough strolling along the shore and checking out all of the restaurants facing the beach. The sand was a sort of grey and a bit scratchy but ok to walk on. There was a bit of surf and a few surfers and wind surfers in the water which was ok to paddle in. Not sure if i'd hang out on a deck chair on the beach but maybe if it was linked to a resort I might give it a go.
Alaa C,10 contributions,Sep 2016,"Beautiful beach with strong waves which I have never experienced before. Besides, it's relatively safe as there are alot of restaurants around. However, there are no changing cubicles or showers."
Jo Phaji E,1 contribution,Jun 2016,We walked a long the beach and enjoyed the sunset.Very clean beach if I compare with another beach that I have visited before. WE LOVE IT.
Stefanie L,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2016,Nice view with beautiful shades of blue of the sky and the ocean. It gets too crowded sometimes. It's quite a commercialised place but still fine for photos
Oztravels7,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,This beach is very difficult to access unless you are staying at the W Hotel as this is about the best place to access it from. On my way out I used another exit which took me back down strange small roads and alley ways. I certainly felt very unsafe. There were also vendors selling goods I the beach that were quite annoying.
montysamui,"Ko Samui, Thailand",Sep 2016,"Quiet and clean beach. Not suitable for swimming, but good for meeting sunset and relaxing in one of the restaurants"
Laura K,"Amityville, NY",Sep 2016,Great beach for long walks...surf schools...sunbathing. At night all the beach bars have bean bag chairs and umbrellas and candles and live music.  And of course food and drink...great place to relax and soak up the local vibe...
Lorraine,"Rickmansworth, UK",Sep 2016,Visited for a long walk which we really enjoyed. Nice to watch the waves rolling in. It is not recommended you swim here so can only dip your feet when it's hot. 
Karan M,England,Aug 2016,The only access is via the Ku DeTa restaurant.  Then you have to walk down broken and dangerous steps to get to the beach.  There is no access visa any other beach front hotel as security staff guard the entrances.  The beach front is reasonably clean and more popular in the evenings when the beer is flowing.
Hokidaymaker057,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,Not really a swimming beach however great for walking for those into fitness.  Lots of surfing spots along the way and sunbeds to relax
kimberly B,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2016,definitely have dinner at one of the great restaurants on this beach. Sunset is at 6:15 and it is a romantic setting. Don't go bear foot the sand is from shells and isn't soft like our Canadian white sand beaches. Chairs and umbrellas for rent on the beach. 
well-travelled4321,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2016,Seminyak beach is actually Kuta beach all the way north to Canggu and sees beach. This is just one long beach facing west and is the offshore wind side of the island during the dry season from April to October. Fantastically long beach with great low tide beach walks.
jadybugs,"Calgary, Canada",Aug 2016,We went to the beach a few times.  We found it hard to access the beach and walked for awhile before being able to enter and same with when we walked along the beach we found it hard to exit.  Plus the beach isn't great for walking up and down so if this is what you are looking for this stretch made it tough!
Debolina B,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2016,Great beach near the breezes bali resort and spa where we were put up. Loads of beach shacks present to just unwind and relax.
jackiLondonUk,london uk,Jul 2016,"went twice while walking around the sholling centre by sea front. lotsof exspensive hotels.very windy, but if you like wind surfing and such then this beach is definatly for you. lots of people guest and locals. people did swim but we had been told that the under currents are very dangerous... don't think I would spend a week here. but then I don't surf."
Stella G,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"Hey thereI have been to Bali many times. During my recent stay my friend and I needed to exchange Australian dolllars and did so at an ""Authorized Money Exchange"" who advertised no commission The money was counted in front of us and placed on the counter.Lucky for us i recounted the money only to find it was substantially shortWhen I questioned this the seller took the money back and recounted the correct amount With over 30 years cash handling experience i was baffled at how i could have miscounnted. ..so i recounted and again it was short!!!I  decided not to go ahead and walked away. After speaking with other travelers they also had this experience.Its a scam and its like magic...like professional card players the money disappears in front of your eyes.Once the money is counted for you...hold it in your hands and recount it and then DO NOT LET it go....not for a second as they are so quick! They will try to distract you by asking you for change saying that they don't have any...walk away as the legit mkney exchange has chsngeThey lure you in by offering a better rateSafe travels all"
Graeme E,3 contributions,Aug 2016,"Massive expanse of beach shore line, plenty of cafe and restaurants to sit outside, day and night. Bit of pestering fron local sellers of tat, but will go away when told."
benkalra,"Chandigarh, India",Sep 2016,"Beach is Superb for Sunset View It has very nice Beach Facing  Eating Points where you can Enjoy GRILLED FOOD , BEER , DRINKS.You Can simply walk from This Beach Upto Kuta Beach , with great view and low sea tides.... Must Must Visit"
Cha√Ømae A,122 contributions,Sep 2016,"Better than kuta beach i loved this place swimming is difficult you just get your feet wet and thats it so dangerous but lovely view and quiet , clean..."
Ric S,"Welwyn Garden City, UK",Aug 2016,fantastic beach with superb lifeguards due to its location.wonderful sunsets and plenty of umbrellas & loungers if you're staying at one of the hotels along its length.
gaytelford,"Telford, UK",Sep 2016,Crashing waves.. perfect beach and an array of fabulous beach bars.. just beautiful. A nice breeze to take off the heat.
Shannah H,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Apr 2016,Go to another beach in Bali of you don't want to feel like you're in a western country/be surrounded by touts/get badgered into buying drugs etc. plenty of other nicer beaches to visit! 
Randi Julian Miranda,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"Good to spend the afternoon here watching beautiful sunset across the sea. They have lots of cafes stretching alongside the beach where you can sit and relax with some fresh cocktails.Anticipate for some souvenirs sellers offering you to buy their stuffs. They can be annoying sometimes, so you better refuse politely if you aren't interested in the beginning yo avoid them from pestering you. "
Vicki H,"Taupo, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"Staying in seminyak decided to check out the beach.  Only 15min walk through the streets which you could stop and barter if you wanted to. Then the beach...wow sand surf and sun. Absolutely beautiful. We are in here now (early September 2016) and the weather is gorgeous. Water warm no sandflies....a few hawkers but l wanted a serong so called one over.  Next minute, the watch guy and jewelry lady were right there....didn't even see them coming haha. If you just be polite and firm with the No they get it. Such a cool place to see highly recommend a visit while in seminyak especially if the weather is hot. "
Cakes1991,"Hertfordshire, UK",Aug 2016,"After being told that the beaches in Seminyak weren't that nice, i was slightly worried as i thought this may effect my holiday, however, the beach was lovely and me and my boyfriend spent most days there. The waves are very strong so perfect for surfing  (if that is your thing). The only annoying thing, is you constantly have people coming up to you to sell you things. They are however very friendly!!"
Hayley W,"Pimpama, Australia",Sep 2016,"Coarse dark sand and lots of rips. Good for small children as the waves roll in a long way so they can jump the smaller waves close to shore. Downside is the constant harrassment from sellers who never stop trying. Don't pay more than $10 for a day bed and umbrella, they often start bargaining at $30. Nice views."
A786KGemma,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2016,"Close to bars and hostels, this beach is the most touristic one on the island. I guess a must see but it would be the shame to stop only to this one as for me this was not the best! This beach is great is you are looking for activities like surf lessons, bars, etc... but it can be sometimes very dirty with plastic packagings..."
Melbournetown01,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"The beach is nice enough, the water is clean and although not anything like your average aus beach it's still worth a visit, pull up a sun bed under an umbrella and watch the day go by. It's good fun and excellent people watching!"
Julie E,"London, UK",Sep 2016,"We walked the length of the beaches from petitenget to Kuta and stopped at Seminyak as it was the nicest part. There are fewer hawkers (although still quite a lot) and it is less busy but still had a great vibe. There are also restaurants on the actual sand which there aren't at Kuta. We stopped at Taris beach bar which was particularly good, with nice seating out front and very reasonable prices which included tax and service charges (unlike most places). The sand was lovely and soft (although too hot in the midday sun) and the water was great. Seemed a great spot for surfing too with lots of people learning in this area. Would definitely recommend it! "
tomac1957,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,We walked every morning to Seminyak beach to enjoy a swim before breakfast. We found the area in front of The Oberoi  hotel to be the best but beware the sand is very hot !
Rokhsaneh R,9 contributions,Sep 2016,The sky... The clouds.. The changing colors of the sunset ... The moon & the stars & the reflection of all these colors on the shore makes you fall in love with earth
FunFlyingFour,"Okinawa City, Japan",Aug 2016,"we were staying in an AirBnb Property only a couple minutes walk from Seminyak Beach so naturally we visited any chance we could. what I loved about the beach is that despite the many visitors, it was still a nice laid back feel to it. It was a great place to ""people watch"" with many people surfing or having lessons, people riding horseback, going for runs, or simply relaxing on one of the lounges offered by the restaurants. At night beanbags and umbrellas are set up with the restaurants also offering live music.  A great place to chill! Our young children loved Seminyak Beach - both during the day and at night."
carolynsouter82,"Albion Park, Australia",Aug 2016,"Dinner at Gado Gado at sunset just the best, the food was of the highest quality, if you get the chance soft shell crab is absolutely stunning "
Julie G,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,In front of Kudeta nice and cleanSome hawkers but not too manyLounge chairs for hireNot calm water tjough
Joanne205205,"Avoca Beach, Australia",Sep 2016,"Just before sunset the bars along the beach out out beanbags, tables and umbrellas with lights on. There are bands set up at each bar.... Where you can see sunset behind them. This is a must !!!! "
Gillian W,Perth,Jul 2016,Beautiful to walk along the beach in all weather at any time of day!The water and sand are clean and safe!
DutchTrvlr,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2016,Clean beach with lots of sunbeds and places to drink. Swimming is actually prohibited according to the flags in the water but everyone seemed to ignore this. This is probably because of the surfers. The waves were very fun to swim in but be careful of the current. 
Dameon G,"Mount Vernon, NY",Sep 2016,This beach is very nice to lounge around or if you're into surfing. The water is kind of rough but the beach is very pretty and relaxing.
dayulaksmi,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"We really love the beach and the ambience surrounded there, the weather at that time was really nice and there're lots of boutique nearby which offer lots of good stuff with good price."
Oana Breazu,"Doha, Qatar",Aug 2016,"Clean, spacious, relaxing beach. Good for surfing. Worth going.In the night you will find amazing atmosphere with food and drinks at the beach bars who organise shows and concerts every night."
spannerwingnut,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"The fact that you can't really swim in the sea, that some sewage flows down the beach and into the sea, and that the beach is littered with rubbish, makes this not the greatest strip of beach! Maybe if you are staying at one of the beach front resorts your experience will be better, obviously it's always awesome to see the ocean. We were expecting more after reading so many great things, we thought we had missed something. The bean bag bars are the only reason to come to the coast. Shame about the drunk people trying to light Chinese lanterns, and sellers trying to sell you random crap, it's ok just to hang at one of the bars. I think if you skip this area you won't miss much. "
Lauren A,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"Went to Seminyak each early in the morning which was nice and peaceful, got 2 day beds for $10, the man was happy to get us drinks at low price when needed. Beach not that suitable for swimming very strong waves and strong current. Annoying around lunch time when they have people trying to sell you items."
juhiSaluja,"Noida, India",Aug 2016,Loved this beach! It was beautiful in the evening and had a calm that could transport you to your favourite memory!
brittsnz,11 contributions,Aug 2016,"Seminyak is great for drinks and a  it to eat at sunset. Seminyak is also great for shopping, both expensive boutiques, smaller bohtiques or market. "
graziella f,"New York City, NY",Jul 2016,I want to first make a disclaimer that I went into this trip believing I would see crystal clear blue waters. Unfortunately that isn't what this beach looks like. Aside from the fact that the sand was as soft as silk the water was brown-ish. What a let down! The water was less than a foot deep for as far as I could see. Which did make for a great place for me to make my first attempt at surfing!
ChrisRooboy1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Great Sunsets every day over the ocean. There are plenty of places to get cold drinks and hire couch or just sit on towel on the clean sand. I had a couple of good massages on the beach.
Tamara G,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,I enjoy going down there at night and during the day. Although a little expensive for drinks the atmosphere is great. 
Phil4218,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2016,"Lets be clear, it's not Australia or the med, it's Bali so it can be a little dirty. Despite that, it's a nice place"
497Bruce,"Hoddesdon, UK",Aug 2016,"It is a lovely wide beach with great sand. We didn't try to swim, but although the waves seemed quite strong, others were swimming and it seemed safe. There didn't seem to be much shade, or sunbeds, unless you attached yourself to a beach club"
GCF77,"Madrid, Spain",Feb 2016,"All the images you have of a balinese tropical paradise, with white sandy beaches lined with palm trees and clear blue sea. Forget that. Seminyak is an urban beach, with hotels and restaurants where palm tress should have been. And the white sand is not son white and full of litter that comes from... the sea..."
Selma110,London,Aug 2016,"Good for surfing, not so good for swimming.  You have to bargain for best deal when hiring or requiring surfing lessons.  The beach has one after theother of surfing stalls."
ItalyReporter,"Bergamo, Italy",Aug 2016,"Long sandy beach stretching from Kuta, Legian to Seminyak. Less busy than the nearby beaches and not so good for surfing but excellent for chill out! "
Holly H,"Bonney Lake, Washington, United States",Aug 2016,"Nice beach, not as crowded as kuta. Beach chairs with umbrellas to rent really cheap and nice. Our hotel was right on this beach very nice. Fun restaurants to watch the sunset on this beach"
calmci,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Beach is expansive and good for everyone. Good hotels with beachfront terraces are great for food and beaching at your convenience.
leamterrace131,"Rhos-on-Sea, UK",Aug 2016,A beautiful  beach and lots going on. We hired beach loungers and there were opportunities  to surf etc.However... massive warning. Be aware of the rip tides. I was pulled out of the sea by 2 life guards and another man when I was dragged back by the strong rip tide. I wasn't in deep but the surf and pull was extremely  overpowering.  Luckily my daughter raised the alarm and I was rescued.  I was taken by ambulance to the BMIC hospital in Kuta. They were brilliant. What wonderful nurses and doctors. After  spending a night in IT I was well enough to continue my holiday.Thank God for the life guards .So my major message is enjoy this beautiful  beach but be aware of the flags . Yellow and red  flags means it's ok to swim  but just be aware.Also swim near life guard spots.Kuta beach can be the same. Be vigilant. Respect the ocean.A massive thank you to those life guards. They surely saved my life.
Lisa T,7 contributions,Aug 2016,"The waves were gorgeous. You can admire the surfers in action. Plus it is where Ku De Ta is located, so you can pop by after playing at the beach. There is even a water point for you to wash away the sand from your feet - free for everybody. But need to be careful if you have young kids because the waves are so strong that they can suddenly swell up from ankle deep to thigh deep in just a few seconds."
clairenich0ls,"Cronulla, Australia",Aug 2016,As an Australian I'd have to say the beach is not as good as ours but the sunset on a beach can never be bad. Good to run along and to watch people practice their boxing.
Camanda80,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"Was a short walk from our hotel. Place was quite crowded, so we skipped messing around after some photo shots."
SchwanenHolgi,"St. Petersburg, Russia",Jul 2016,"This beach offers you all comforts you can imagine: high waves for surfing, glassy surface during low tide; broad beach for jogging and games, strong push back during high tide; party beach with drinks and music or calm places back of the sea; spectacular sun downs as well as tropical thunderstorms; a happy and joyful get together of all nationalities regardless of any religion...this is how beach life should look like!"
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,you could easily reach this beach by going north from Kuta Beach. there are several restaurant that took part of this beach but you could still enjoy the beach. this beach is perfect for sport activity as the sand is soft and wont hurt your feet. the entrance fee is free
Marty T,"Meeniyan, Australia",Aug 2016,"Great beach to visit, lively atmosphere, kids parents, lovers, runners, walkers, kites, playing dogs, you name it! Probably the best people watching beach I have visited bar Copacabana. And the sunsets are the best part for me!"
Manjusha P,22 contributions,Aug 2016,"Beautiful beach, amazing people. Try to catch the sunset so no point going on a cloudy day. Beware of stray dogs though. Some food souvenir shops too. "
Stephanie H,15 contributions,Aug 2016,"The sunset is amazing, not as many people hasseling you to buy things although ive been three times this year and Seminyak is getting busier and more expensive. Kids playing as the sun goes down is the best part of our trips here, then live music on the beach at night. "
Alwaysablade,"Sheffield, UK",Aug 2016,"Long sandy beach, good for walking. Sun beds comfy - you have to barter, if you return for a number of days the person selling the sun beds will remember you and give a good price. We paid on average 180,000 rupiah for two beds and an umbrella from 11 am until around 5.30. You can buy ice cold drinks from the sunbed seller as well. If you like playing in the waves then this is place for you, surfing, boogie boarding- not swimming though. There are loads of locals selling their crafts. After a day on the beach the sunsets can be spectacular and the bars bordering the beach come to life with live music. We have enjoyed 10 days in Seminyak"
SammyJS,"Cardiff, UK",Aug 2016,"Lovely clean beach with groups, couples and families. You can sit and watch the surfers with a drink it hand. Plenty of beach bars and restaurants on the beach and the strip, but the sunset here is stunning. "
Joanna F,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"My partner and I strolled down to the beach from our resort not knowing what to expect, lots of restaurants with bean bags, lights and great food, some even had live music, great night"
Jo G,"Wateringen, The Netherlands",Aug 2016,"The beach is very nice, huge waves, nice breeze and very nice coffee restaurants near beach. all people are pleasant, and it is very peacefull."
eugenia w,"Tucson, AZ",Aug 2016,"...is palpable as soon as your feet hit the sand. The light and quality of the water are unique to this place, and I found it all mesmerizing.  This is certainly one of the most groovy beaches I have experienced with miles of delicious sand and people of all persuasions enjoying the surf, the dining and imbibing."
Bkap11,"London, UK",Aug 2016,Best sunsets happen on this beach. The waves are awesome as well!! Normally gets busier as the day progresses. Overall really enjoyed riding the waves.
Paradise84364,"Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia",Aug 2016,Was glorious water down by la Plancha. Further North the waste water pours down in rivers from the town and I'm sure is highly polluted. The further north you go the worse it smells.
David E,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"Just love Seminyak beach at night, so much going on and so many places to enjoy the evening sunset.We enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta where everything is so much in your face. Seminyak gives you everything at just the right tempo - restaurants, shopping, beach life and atmospherc.  "
DiveCultureSG,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"I am a regular in Bali, and i would always visit this beach out of all the other beaches in Bali. Not only that it isn't so crowded, but it is clean also compared to the other main beaches in Bali. The sunsets are also nicer as compared to Kuta. Location does really play a big role. I am a big fan of sunsets."
matt d,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,Water is noce and has waves to surf body or buggy board. The locals on the beach sell beer and have beds to lay on. You can have surfing lessons and get you hair braded. Many many activities
NINA M,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"best time on the beach is during sunset , 5.00pm A place called La Plancha is awesome.great music /Djand great menu !!"
Rachna86,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2016,Lovely beach with great shacks to have a beer and food. Excellent for surfers too as the waves were awesome!
Amanda W,"Wallaroo, Australia",Aug 2016,"We arrived to the beach around 4;30pm and the beach was buzzing. Pulled up on a beanbag and drank bintangs while listening to a band and watching the sunset, beautiful and relaxing!"
robqu,"Brooklyn Park, Australia",Aug 2016,Beautiful and clean beach. Great for boogie boarding and surfing. Just swim between the flags as there is quite a rip!! Not too many people either which is s bonus. 
Dawsay,"Leeds, UK",Apr 2016,Nice beach but not the best I've ever seen. Never got too crowded and was more suited for a stroll than perhaps a day at the beach.  The locals loved it and in the evenings it really came to life.Sunset was beautiful and worth the visit just for this.
Wayfarer_Dave,"Salzburg, Austria",Jul 2016,"I've been to Seminyak many times now and love it. The beach is fantastic, I love going to La Plancha and the other beach bars to get a mid afternoon drink in between splashing in the surf and relaxing on one of the many recliners. As the sun nears the moment of spectacular sunsets I transition to one of the colourful beanbag chairs to enjoy the view. Then, I stay at a nearby hotel so I can quickly shower, change and get to one of Seminyak's many gorgeous delicious restaurants. It's easy enough to rent a motorcycle or hire a driver to go up and around the island on longer days to view the many temples, rice terraces and other more Balinese favourite spots. I will warn that our fellow Australian neighbours tend to get a bit crazy and exhibit at times an appalling lack of respect for the local people and other tourists. But, hey, there are many Aussies that are super charming and delightful... I love you guys. Just reign in the trashy types a bit better... frankly, it's embarrassing. We all want to have a good time in this friendly, gorgeous place... it doesn't require falling on the ground or vomiting in the bushes to make that possible. Our Indonesian hosts would appreciate your thoughtfulness as well.Do keep in mind that Seminyak is in the trio of townships along western Bali that are most commercial and frequented by tourists. You can minimise the negative impacts of this by keeping your daily travel to a minimum, locating your accommodations close to where you want to spend most of your time and planning all day tours for yourself that start early in the morning before traffic gets really ramped up."
John F,43 contributions,Aug 2016,Seminyak beach is a great spot to relax have a quiet drink and watch another bali sunset go down. There are not as many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach here so you can relax more. I would recommend semiyak beach for drinks food and relaxation.
Steve C,"Sanur, Indonesia",Aug 2016,Many people visit Seminyak Beach to swim during the day but in the evening it's about walking along the water's edge taking in the beautiful sunsets and the many attractions along the beach. Kite surfers and horseback riders silhouetted in gold and bronze by the setting Sun made fabulous photo memories. Many ceremonies are being enacted in Bali at the moment and there was a gathering of Balinese families enjoying the twilight beach in traditional white and yellow bringing offerings and sharing the peaceful atmosphere. Wonderful moment.
Anthea W,"Cheddar, UK",Aug 2016,"Within walking distance of our villa which was great. Easy access, choice of sun beds or just a towel on the beach. There are safety flags for swimming but be cautious as there can be a strong undertow. Beach was clean from rubbish. Would recommend a visit. "
T S,"Jupiter, FL",Aug 2016,Enjoyed the waves and the sunset but could not forget the five waterlogged diapers sitting on the beach. 
Paras S,27 contributions,Aug 2016,Chilled on the beach to see the sunset...what more can one say but was stunning!Definitely add to the list of things that one MUST do when visiting Seminyak!!
Johnsnelgrove,"Hong Kong, China",Aug 2016,This is a really good public beach that is available 24 hours. But a couple of things: dog poo and pollution stop it being a great beach . Clean it up and you gave a 5 star to
Jose G,"Valencian Country, Spain",Aug 2016,"Big beach, not much shade (none). Bring your own shade, and towels, and surfboard, and lunch. There is some street vendors around, maybe more up the way, did not venture down to far."
Anne-marie S,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"Not the best indicator of traditional Balinese culture. Over crowded, with better beaches 30 mins away. We preferred spending time in Ubud, Keramas, Amed, Gili Meno etc. since we were after culture. Stay here if you don't want experience Indonesia. :) plenty of party spots and night life if your into that sorta stuff. :) :) It is more expensive here with plenty of scammers than the rest of Bali. (It is part of the Kuta party scene, we heard the night clubs from our hotel). "
Natsta14,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Clean, lots of little restaurants and bars, big waves, what more could you want. There are sun beds and chairs/bean bags but need to be early to get them. "
Dean S,6 contributions,Aug 2016,Went down to the beach to watch the sunset and have drinks sitting on the beanbags listening to the different music in each location. Negative is the locals trying to sell you stuff all the time!
Sarah R,28 contributions,Jul 2016,"On our two week holiday to Seminyak, the beach was our favourite place to be. Throughout the day it's no so busy so great to relax of for the kids. It tends to get busier when everyone comes to watch the sunset, one word WOW!!!!. The beach is so clean, gorgeous sand, hardly any shells, so great to walk on barefoot. The sea is amazing for waves, fab place to hire a body board or surf board. Life guards are exceptional and very observant, due to the tide getting strong at times. It's by far the best beach we have ever been on, definitely recommend."
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Aug 2016,"Great beach, good waves, beautiful sunsets, nice beach bars. Only in high season it can get very crowded here. But the beach is big enough"
Achibitsy,"Bucharest, Romania",Aug 2016,"The beach beds are colorful. The Balinese umbrellas too. It is a nice place to sit and relax. Beach boys were very helpful. The prices are lower than Kuta. One of the beach boys recommended us a place to eat. Good food, small prices. "
JuliaMedved,2 contributions,Aug 2016,"Dirty beach, maybe a bit cleaner than Legian but still lots of rubbish everywhere on the beach. There are a few Warungs on the way as everywhere in Bali to buy beer, but not many. Quite a few beachfront luxury hotels with sea view etc. Waves are ok if you want to swim. We are not surfers so can't say anything about surfing conditions. Worth going to Echo point beach for cleaner sand and nice views"
Cheryl H,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Nice to visit for short stay but other coastal beaches are nicer in Bali...try Uluwatu, Padang Padang or Jimbaran Bay"
expatinindo2016,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Not the best in Bali, If you want the sunshine this is a great place. tends to get busy during afternoon."
wonderingtraveller80,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2016,"this is place for learning to surf, the tides are manageable and the whole experience is enjoyable, plenty of places to eat, drink and watch the sunset"
beegee165,"Tallahassee, FL",Aug 2016,"I was disappointed. There was alot of trash in the water. The surf was so strong couldn't really swim, just stand and let the waves crash around you. Lots of surfers in training, but no real waves for them to ride, waves broke before any rideable curl. There were warning flags for rip currents and if you didn't get knocked down while waves were coming in there was a big chance they were dragging you out! We got 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for 150k and had it for as long as we wanted. Lots of people walking around selling food and souvenirs. "
Eatenjoysleep,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,"Good beach, clean, nice waves up to three meters high. It can be dangerous in the water at some spots because of outwards currents but these are pinpointed by lifeguards with flags on the beach. I do freaking hate the guys working on the beach overcharging for the sunbeds and umbrella. Our hotel hostess told us 100 rp. is normal for 2 beds and an umbrella. They asked for 200-300 so we ended up with our beachtowel on the sand, which is free obviously"
Kungandhi,Delhi,Jun 2016,Good beach to get relax with friends and family and activities are enjoyful. very nice weather and enjoying beach with family. 
Paul P,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Seminyak beach is a dark sand beach with some famous bars, beach clubs and restaurants alongside as well as some high end hotels. Why on earth they can't look after the beach is beyond me. It's full of rubbish from visitors and vendors. If the bars weren't here, no-one would visit because there are a million other beaches that are better than this."
travelynnemiles,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Not a beach swimmer ourselves, but we went for the sunset and eats. Was a hot day for this time of year.Late arvo and the place was mad with people sitting on the beach in front of cafes & bars.  Crazy seeing so many people there and we were only on the Southern side of it."
sheeatsshewrites,"Guangzhou, China",Aug 2016,Senmiyak is a nice beach with easy waves for those looking to learn how to surf. There are loads of locals who offer board rental and classes.
Perlissima,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,Not overcrowded. Clean with lovely waves for swimming and surfing (beginners). Places to eat and drink at various points along the way. Pretty great bars on the sand to enjoy sunsets!
Wade M,"Paralowie, Australia",Aug 2016,"To me this was just a beach, nice view from sitting up at Resturant. But water is not great, beach was not 100% clean, rubbish about a bit. Ultimately, there is better choice for nicer beaches over on Bali. "
Pallavi T,5 contributions,May 2016,this is the perfect place to chill and crowded but peaceful.awesome bars are there and you can enjoy live music.   
Orchardsam,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",Aug 2016,Not as busy as other beaches as more out of the way.  Several surf rental shops on the beach.  Drinks and snacks at hotel beach bars.  Stunning location for sunset.  Clean and friendly.
Mal L,"Leicestershire, UK",Aug 2016,"Good beach great surf life guard on duty, is busy, only draw back No off people selling junk pestering you!"
DeHeavenTour Official,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is always been our favourite place to hang out with friends and family. The beach is super safe for small kids. Sand is very powdery. Food and drinks at night cafe has variety menus and affordable price. Live music is awesome. And the sunset is fabolous scenery people has to see. Love love love it
mrchris2012,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Lovely in the evening for a stroll. Daytime wil be busy with hawkers selling everything so just grab a chair (pay) sit down and enjoy the view.
Erin G,30 contributions,Aug 2016,"A lot of scammers and money hungry people, stay on your game and if you don't want something say NO from the very start. Otherwise a beautiful beach. "
Michael B,7 contributions,Aug 2016,"Ok for anyone that wants to visit for their first time please understand the following Cons:1) the sand is not white and appears to have black volcanic ash in it 2) the water is not crystal clear nor blue it is more green / brown 3) some of the fresh water run off is full of rotting vegetation waste and stinks so bad 4) there are no free toilets 5) beach vendors wonder up and down trying to sell things. Be polite and just say ""tee dack Terry Me Ka See"" this means no thank you. Learn this line ASAPPros:1) lots of atmosphere and great sunsets! The music is great everyone is friendly and very festival like! 2) great location and useful beach to walk from Kuta to Seminyak often quicker then riding a taxi  3) there are some great waves and it's great to learn to surf 4) there are red and orange flags for swimming with lifeguards watching to patrol (always follow their instructions)5) there are cheap sun lounges for rent and umbrellas. The price fluctuates with supply and demand. If it's Saturday and sunny expect to pay up to  $aud10.00 for 2 beds for the day! Get over it the beers are only $2.50 consider it the cheapest cover charge. If you want nice white sandy beaches ask a local uber driver and 30 mins away you can get to a white sandy beach. "
Cat L,27 contributions,Aug 2016,"Having stayed in packed Kuta before, I thought I'd take my friend and I to the recommended Seminyak for a bit more up market lifestyle.The beach is definitely better standard than Kuta as it is less packed, has nicer bars with nicer food and seating areas and more reasonably priced beds for the day (norm 100'000 per bed for the day).Great bars for sunset which serve pretty decent food and some good sunsets.However, there are constant waves here with strong currents. Swimming isn't really possible, but jumping waves is as is trying our surfing! Definitely would not recommend for families with small kids who want to swim, or poor swimmers.Head to Nusa Dua for calmer and bluer seas with whiter sands. We did for a day!"
Samrat R,17 contributions,Aug 2016,It's a shame we didn't get enough time here. The beach has big waves and a nice sunset. You can laze here whole day. It will be good to have public toilets (you can pay a small fee to the warungs to do your business)
World Traveller,"Santa Barbara, CA",Aug 2016,"We took a walk along the beach around 3km and while it is packed full of tourists and locals we were shocked to find what looked and smelled like sewage draining into the sea! This did not seem to deter anyone tho! There are great waves on this beach and plenty of surfers but on this particular day there was a very strong undercurrent and the lifeguards were out and blowing whistles and waving the ref flags! It's a lively walk and seemed relatively safe! Many hotels border the beachfront and there are some nice bars and restaurants overlooking the sea! There is some great live music at night, nice place for drinks and dinner! Note that there are lots of pan handlers selling different things on the beach! A simple 'no thanks' and they usually leave you alone! "
Aformz,78 contributions,Aug 2016,Nice beach. Dont have to worry about being harassed as you would in kuta. Lots of great beach shacks around offering good food and drinks at good prices 
Amiya-Poonam,"Hyderabad, India",Aug 2016,"Good beach. Nice sunset view. Little crowded and IMO could be better kept as well. There are many other better beaches that I have been to, but can go (especially for the sunset view), if you are in that area."
Jaymie B,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,Sat here on the beach almost every night at a friends beach bar. Chilled under the umbrellas with a cold Bintang until the sun began to set and then I would go out near the water and watch the sun come down. Absolutely beautiful sunsets in Bali and watching it on the beach is just mesmerising. 
Jerry Z,5 contributions,Jul 2016,Just a beach. But still nice to visit. Make sure you swim between the flags or you will be caught in a strong rip
Natalie K,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,Lots to see at this beach.  Great at sunset.  If your looking for peace and quiet this is not the location. üëçüèª
DWgoldengrove,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2016,Unfortunately beach is full of much litter and the odd syringe. Its a  shame because Seminyak is a quieter spot than Kuta but still suffers from the same issues. More upmarket 5 Star hotels along this stretch and generally a higher concentration of European tourists visit here.
josie m,United Kingdom,Aug 2016,"We stayed in seminyak for 3 days. The beach was okay, however, there was a lot of rubbish that made its way into the water. Not the best beach and certainly not the prettiest. Chairs cost 100,000 irp for the whole day. Not a bad price! "
BapaCooch,"Basin View, Australia",Aug 2016,"As a beach, it's got dark coarse sand, and waves. What is really nice are the many places to sit a watch sunsets"
The_Billy_Whizz,14 contributions,Aug 2016,"But it's definitely not a pretty beach! Steeply raked down to the ocean on the northern side and really quite rough with a strong drag. Definitely not a swimming beach whilst we were there in early August. Sand looks volcanic and is very dark and rough. Unfortunately, there is also a significant sewage outlet and if you're walking along the beach, there's no option but to step through it. Some significant works taking place alongside the waste outlet whilst we were there and WH&S was most definitely not on the builders list of importance so be very careful trying to get on and off the beach there. Fairly strong security will not let you off the beach and through one of the hotels until you get all the way down to Legian or an equal distance north and about 300 m past Potato Head so make sure that you're up for a walk I wouldn't suggest Seminyak if you want a beach holiday."
l_williams7,"Birkenhead, UK",Aug 2016,"we stayed in seminyak for a week and went for a walk along the beach. i was worried having read some other reviews about it being untidy, it certainly wasnt on the occasions i went! Sitting in one of the bean bag bars and watching the sunset with a dronk of your choice is a must!! Plus the beach sellers are really friendly and you can pick up a bargain too if you wish! Live music plays as you drink and watch the waves and sunset!"
Andysafrica11,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"A great beach to walk early in the morning, before it gets too hot. Lovely to watch the sun set as well with a cool drink."
Arthur747,"Foiano Della Chiana, Italy",Jul 2016,"We loved this beach. But you can only swim on parts of the beach.The baywatch guys (sorry no busty girls in orange swimsuits) keep blowing their whistles to move swimmers to a safer place due to high current. You are pulled back into the sea by this. They leave swimmers with a surf board be, but they do not know if these are beginners of professionals. So be careful if you are not an experience surfer as the current is very strong here. You can rent a bed for 50K and order cheap Bintang bear with these guys too. Friendly guys."
Graham P,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",Jul 2016,"this beach is very popular especially at sunset when the view of the setting sun is spectacular, being a short walk from most hotels and resorts makes it accessible "
sflsenglish,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Aug 2016,"The Sands is in a good central location with live music and a DJ in the evening, Seminyak has a reputation for spectacular sunsets. "
Sharlene K,"Victoria, Australia",Jul 2016,Finding our way to the beach was quite a challenge but once we found it they were very busy  don't try to sit on the provided chairs as they Cost 1500 rup  for a half hour  great sunsets though 
michelleborg2016,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Wonderful experience with the family. Seafood, Sunset what more do you want. Such a spiritual feeling ....... try it you'll love it."
karpenisi,"Greenacre, Australia",Aug 2016,Walked down from Courtyard Marriot where we stayed  lots of motor bikes everywhere. The beach is not clean so we just walked back to enjoy the pool in our hotel. 
altem,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"We took the kids, relaxed and watched the sunset and meet some awesome people there, entertainment was really good as well."
John B,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,The beach has been cleaned up over recent years but the creeks running into the sea need further urgent attention. I would not be swimming anywhere near the creeks (read drains) but well away is fine.The sunsets are magic.
Peter M,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,Great place to hang out and soak up the sun and have a beer or two. Excellent eating spots along the beach front.
Nithin,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2015,The water here is clear and is a very good place to Surf. There are many eateries which serve very good local and international cuisine.
thetravelbuddha,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Grab a beanbag, grab a beer and watch the sunset (along with the 4000 other people doing the same). Get there early to get the front row."
Desti R,9 contributions,Jul 2016,"the beach has some cafe that have a colorfull beanbag to chill and watch the sunset, nice place to hangout with your friends."
robynmaree99,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"We sat at the beach at the end of our resort, took a bottle of wine and watched the sunset.  There were people flying kites, walking past, swimming and live music to add to the feel of the night. Very relaxed, nobody hassled us to buy anything as we were staying at The Royal Beach Resort, so sellers aren't allowed to approach you"
nomadmattm,275 contributions,Jul 2016,"The saying is when in Rome; but when I'm Seminyak make sure you hit the beach! Many little eateries, grab some sliders, a Bintang and watch the sun set, awesomeness! "
L337337,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Good surf. Plenty to do. Lots of beach restaurants and bars to watch the sunset!The bed 'salesman' are a determined lot and will obviously allow you to overpay. 50,000 should secure you a bed and umbrella. Lots of folks selling things which can be annoying.  Until the ice cream man appears......then we're talking!"
Thow E,22 contributions,Jul 2016,It's fun to spend time here. The waves are awesome for sea sports or just play. The sand and water are crystal clear. 
Vikrant0308,"Amritsar, India",Jul 2016,"I went to seminyak beach after kuta beach, so I felt that Seminyak beach is not that happening as kuta beach, But cleanliness is good on beach, and is near KU DE TA and patato beach head"
vithiya S,7 contributions,Jul 2016,"No words can describe the beauty of this beach.   It's simply stunning and the water is so clean.  The sand is also great, making it a wonderful relaxation spot.  Definitely a must go place in bali."
Shelley D,"West Kelowna, Canada",Jul 2016,"Loved this beach! Ran on it every morning. Surfed, swam and sunbathed during the day and enjoyed the beach restaurants with live music every night! Paradise!"
joel r,8 contributions,Jun 2016,Some pictures i captured on Seminyak beach so relaxing sitting back and enjoying the moment.Looking forward to going again on a holiday
Boppojr,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Ok this isn't your storybook beach, no white sand and light blue water here, but. It's fun, bigger than normal surf at certain times of the day, meters from most hotels, warm and just easy. It's no doubt polluted and there area some smelly steams leading into it, but not massively more than any Asian beach or if the bay's & beaches of many Australian cities like Sydney & Melbourne, just swim well away from the streams "
dancer662015,"Crawley, UK",Apr 2016,"There are two halves to the beach, from the entrance to the right is a quiet long stretch of sand and to the left is a bustling vibrant beach bar and watersports stretch. Lovely place to walk early morning, fairly empty with just a few dog walkers, joggers, surfers  and yoga enthusiasts. During the day and evening it gets much livelier with the bars filling up, all competing at night to have the best / loudest live music! Food and drink can be found easily and cheaply and it's a good spot for a sociable evening / night. For surfing the waves tend to be suitable for beginners and there are a lot of surfing schools towards the far end of the beach where the moped track runs along the back. The track / road along the back of it dies get very busy with mopeds but that's Bali for you! "
Vicki B,147 contributions,Jul 2016,"I spent 6 hours chilling at this beach this afternoon and this evening. We experienced chillin on the beach bean bags, refreshing drinks, food, market sellers and to top off a beautiful sunset we were provided live band playing till late. Highly recommend for families too. üòÄ"
thadeshwar,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Jul 2016,"its a long beach and clean,and the sand is good to walk on but not so fine,get a cheap foot massage done,one can get beach beds on hire at reasonable rate or simply hang out at kudeta lounge"
pbxl1,brussels,Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is a quite place to enjoy a slowly sunset. The sea current is dangerous but gives you beautiful sights of the waves.
Jun L,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2016,"Not recommended for family with young kids due to strong waves and current, beach was not clean, lot of disposable  plastic on the shoreline"
Zara L,13 contributions,Nov 2015,"Gorgeous beach to enjoy all day, with many an opportunity taken to sunbake or have drinks each night and one of the many esky's. At times it can unfortunately have a bit of rubbish deposited on it. Overall I lovely place to take a walk or have a drink! "
TonyBernardo,"London, UK",Sep 2015,Seminyak ended up being my favourite beach spot! Not so crowded as its southern neighbours!! Some fine restaurants and beach bars! And that's when we start to see some quality resorts!!
Cycorp,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"Had some of the best times EVER of my life at this beach! I still remember back when all the hustle and bustle was at Kuta's Legian Beach and Seminyak seemed so quiet and far off yet the two beaches connected. As time went by and more and more people decided to make Bali home did this Seminyak beach along with one of its now world-famous establishments, KUDETA, did it explode as THE NEW beach to be at and be seen on. The last time I must say was that there must have been some shifts in energies between the Earth, Moon and Su, because never have I ever felt such a dramatic and immense energy of the sea pulling me and my kids out so sea, not once but almost three times!The beach looked like the tundra plains of Alaska at one stage and then suddenly huge waves as high as 2.5Meters would come crashing towards us and the many other brave ones in the sea that day. I had to hold with as much strength as I could muster as the kids were being literally dragged out to sea! Truly incredible and what an awesome sight and experience for all to witness and feel the power of Nature in all its its rawness!Were the kids scared? Maybe a little.Was I scared? Yeah, I think so.Will we be back? ABSOLUTELY!!! üòÉüòÇ"
LittleNickyA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,I love swimming here anytime of day. Before breakfast you can have the beach to yourself and if you swim out to the breakers and look back over the Oberoi hotel you can see the volcanoes in the distance when the sky is clear. During the day the beach us usually quite busy but still fun. In the evening lots of people come down to watch the sunset 
Natasha R,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"One thing I had to do each morning before entering the beach was walk around the rubbish and dogs... Bali is clearly over loaded by tourism. The people are really in your face, even when your sitting in a restaurant on the beach just wanting to relax and sip cocktails... Time and time again I would get hassled and miss my sunset moment. I love Bali. But they really need to stop the hawkers as it's quite annoying and unpleasant. Also ridiculous charges to hire beach lounges! $40! For the day. Food pretty expensive on beach. Loved the live music, movies and good quality eats. Surf was ok pretty dumpy. "
AussieWonderlust,"Launceston, Australia",Jul 2016,"We spent 2 days on the beach.  We hired 2 sun lounges with an umbrella and told our host to keep the Bintangs coming!  The water is super warm but beware for the rip tides and the big wave dumpers.  You will be inundated with Balinese trying to sell their wares.  This is part of the beach experience - definitely stop the ladies with the fruit, you won't be disappointed!  Don't be afraid to eat local.  Some of the best food is sold on the back of a motorcycle.  There are a few pop up kitchens on the beach run by local women.  This food is so cheap and fresh and ridiculously cheap.  They even deliver it to your sun lounge.TIPS:Make sure you put on lots of sunscreen, even though you're in the shade those UVs punch through everything!Take the time to pick your beach host - the guy trying to get you to sit on his sun lounges.  Some a nicer/better than others.You'll need to pay approx 4000-5000 RP for a trip to the toilets on the beach"
ancilla w,10 contributions,Jul 2016,"It is a happening place with locals playing  soccer, people swimming and surfing and people chilling with a drink..."
Marc P,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"the beach is on par with most beaches in bali. Once you get there you can spend the whole day and evening there. Food ,drinks,sunbeds,surfing and the perfect place to watch the sunset having a meal and drinks.."
Reemsh21,"Middleton, WI",Jul 2016,Clean beach but watch out for the waves and tides! They are quite high and if you are not a good swimmer I wouldn't even suggest going in! Water is clean though and the sand is free of rocks and shells that hurt your feet.   
pkfong,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2016,Seminyak Beach is a lovely stretch of sand with waves  lapping onshore. Tourists still throng the shoreline. Watch out for the occasional drug pusher as happened when I was there. Decline politely when touts approach you. Otherwise it remains a pleasant place to walk and enjoy the sea breeze. Five star hotels dot this area and they have good dining facilities if you wish to splurge on a meal.
Kevin t,"Jindalee, Australia",Jul 2016,On my first visit to Bali I went to seminyak beach and was disappointed due to the fact that it was totally unappealing there were huge King tides and it was unsuitable for swimming and relaxing .I expected the beach to be better and the waves smaller on my second visit however exactly the same .Seminyak has a good vibe and is a great area but the beach lets it down
Sonya K,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is beautiful. The sand isn't white but oh so soft. The sunset is just exquisite to watch while sitting in the bean bags provided by the local restaurants. Staff will take your orders for drinks, snacks and/or dinner. The locals will want you to buy their wares, be direct if you aren't interested. It is their livelihood after all. "
purplepeta,93 contributions,Jun 2016,Seminyak is my favourite beach it's clean and always something going on my favourite place to eat is along there too ! We can buy things on the beach and get pampered by lovely Ella üíú the tide was a bit high this year but that doesn't stop us from going I would just be careful at high tide! The locals here are lovely and not too pushy 
Susan S,2 contributions,Jul 2016,"Not very clean, but they have had a couple of storms.  Lot of rubbish on the beach and surrounds.Would not hurry back there again."
Paul H,5 contributions,Feb 2016,"Never seen anything like this. Rubbish everywhere. I was informed that it is like this, every year at this time (February). People on the beach selling things very pushy, don't like taking no for an answer. One in particular was extremely rude. Water was a great temperature, although when you get out you have plastic bags stuck to you.The beach was that disgusting that I took photo's of it. The locals do there best to get it cleaned up every morning before the tourists get down there, to no avail. "
Wah L,11 contributions,Aug 2015,"It was definitely a good plan during honeymoon to have a relax romantic dinner at the beach. There is also live band singing and it is an option to give tips. the seafood is fresh and they do serve tiger prawn, and variety of fish."
Peter_Pfister888,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,Beach is nice but due to heavy waves and strong current can't swim in the sea especially children. Lost sunglasses and slippers due to heavy waves which was not pleasant to walk back without slippers.
Farid Abd,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,"Nice beach to go in the morning. Clean water. Long Stretch of beach. There's a lot of sun beds but you need to pay. I don't know the price as I didn't use. There's people doing exercises, learning surfing...etc. but if you go to the side where it's near double 6 hotel the beach is less crowded."
juzz_9,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is a clean, relaxing destination to hire a sun lounge and soak up the beautiful Bali sun!  The service you get in the beach is incredible....lady selling pineapples and cutting up in front of you, Bintang sold by the vendors on the beach, icy poles as you lay there....you don't have to move.  The Balinese are such lovely, friendly people who never harass you to purchase their wears.  I fall more in love with Seminyak beach the more times I go!  Highly recommend putting your feet up and choosing this awesome beach destination!  "
Mark S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"Always something going on no matter if it's during the day to sit & relax or surf along with having a lunch or at night when the beach bars/restaurants are a buzz with live music.Some of the eateries are better than others and can be expensive when comparing to prices in restaurants along the Seminyak strip, but the sunset ting is what you pay for, quite wonderful.Yes those selling anything and everything can be annoying but still a worthwhile experience."
Praise Chee,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jul 2016,It's amazing in the evening especially after sunset as there is live band playing some music. The beach is long. They have a few of outdoor cafe with serves you some food and drinks. There is beam bags at the beach with a small table where u can enjoy the stars and lighting of the city. The locals are selling the lantern to the tourist with rph 100000 but if we buy from the restaurant waiter they can give a cheaper price. The sand at the beach is soft and sandy. It's comfortable and cooling
potatolord 5,72 contributions,Jul 2016,Perfectly pleasant as beaches go. The waves in this area are well suited to surfing but not to paddling for small children. There are occasional lifeguards in the area which seem to be connected to some of the beachfront hotels. They weren't always looking seaward. 
betty1957,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Very good staff always at hand making sue you are comfortable and shuttle always arrived on time did not have problems with hawkers on the beach not allowed in our area
Axiomwatson,"Torquay, Australia",Jul 2016,"A very average beach - ok for the younger crowd I guess, but not what I would call an attractive beach."
Sarah V,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Nice beach to sit down and watch the sun set! There aren't too many vendors hassling you and it's great to sit near the beach clubs to hear the music and chill out.Great beach to relax and pop into the beach clubs for a drink. 
holidaycoco,"Chengdu, China",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is great fun for catching waves, learning how to surf, having a nap and lounging around. Lots of people around enjoying the same things. Water is warm, sand is clean. Many dogs in this area, walking around freely. Often they go chase each other. Very fun to watch!Lots of seating areas. Often depending on what hotel you're in. The seats have Hotel names on them, such as Harris Hotel, Horrison and The Courtyard, etc.."
radwa s,"Cairo, Egypt",Jul 2016,"The beach was v clean, and a long strip.We paid 100Rupes for 2 sun beds for 1 hr- you need to bargain heavily as is the case with all bali. Only con is the locals passing by selling stuff other than that its just perfect specially foe a free beach"
Chris B,"Miranda, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak Beach is very popular. Nice sand and a wide stretching beach with many waterfront restaurants. Good during the day, better at night. Music played all day and late into the night. You can swim, surf, play ball games on the beach or simply enjoy a cold drink under the umbrellas and watch the action in front of you."
Rakesh K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Long and clean beach. Not overcrowded. Lovely walk along at any time. Lot of activities along the beach. Feel safe. Food and drinks always on hand
cassiesim,Melbourne,Jul 2016,Gotta visit if you're staying in Seminyak! Makes no sense if you don't pop by from one of the nearby beach clubs or restaurants :) 
ReggieLombard,"London, UK",Jul 2016,beautiful beach with plenty of waves and soft sand to chill out on. Fantastic sunsets!One drawback was the dirty water flowing into the sea - not sure where it came from but it did smell!
voulas_travels,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Jan 2016,"unfortunately at the time of year that we went, the beach was full of rubbish up and down the shoreline.  Im not sure if that is all year through but it was very dissapointing"
ParamaliJetsetter,"Puerto de la Cruz, Spain",Jul 2016,"Very disappointed with this beach, when we went there was rubbish strewn all over the beach. There are only a handful of sunbeds and the owners tried to charge 200,000 rupees for 2 beds, paid only 50.000 at Legian. "
Jean & John C,"Monasteraden, Ireland",Jul 2016,Nice beach and lots of hotels around for lunch or an early dinner after a day on the beach.   Very clean and good amenities
NoakhaillaBHOOT,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2016,"Its THE best beach in Bali to spend the day with your family and friends. Its not crazy crowed like Kuta or Legian Beach. Also for me, the crowd here seemed a bit better in terms of ""class"" (sorry for being politically incorrect) ... but its true!!! Kuta and Legian beaches are like fish markets compared to this one. This beach is much much cleaner and the restaurants on the beach are quite nice, nothing great but just nice. You can rent seats/umbrella for USD 20 for the whole day, surf boards are USD 7.5, body boards are USD 4 !!! There are beer guys right at the beach, they serve really chilled beers and drinks (with nuts) right to you on the sand. Its awesome. But the best part was the water, it was warm to perfection. We simply loved our time at the Seminyak beach. I highly recommend this one."
IngridHughes,"Lugo, Spain",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is a very long sandy beach, not the best for swimming, in fact it is very dangerous to do so in most parts but it's great for surfing. The beach isn't too dirty although there are some areas where dirty water and sewers come out. There are many beachside bars with poufs or chairs on the sand, lovely for chilling out and watching the beautiful sun set!"
happytrip80,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2016,"The beach smelled with sewage. After staying in other lovely beaches such as Gili Meno island and Lombok, I was quite disappointed with this side of beach"
Camper151349,68 contributions,Jul 2016,Lovely beach and perfect for romantic stroll or a surfing session!vendors selling beer and soft drinks and snacks!enjoy üòâ
Darren O,22 contributions,Jul 2016,Waves can vary on swell size. But beautiful sandy beach sand Colour is slightly grey but still a beautiful beach. A three year old would be fine in the shallows. And even if your a surfer there is a rideable wave every day for mid to novice surfers.  On a good day I've seen good surfers out there but it's not pipeline or bells beach.   Boards n lessons for hire on beach 
Joyce A,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,When in seminak head down the beach for sunset hire a bean bag sip on a cocktail and soak up the atmosphere enjoy the beats or an acoustic treat order a cheap pizza All in all relaxing and fun and won't blow the budget 
gabbystanden,"Pacific Coast Australia, Australia",Jul 2016,the beach was polluted with sewage going down to the water  that you need to walk through to get to some of the restaurants. the bean bags at the beach was nice with a great atmosphere its just the sewage that killed is for our romantic walk   
Janeymc24,Offaly ,Jul 2016,Lovely to watch the surfers. Nice beach to walk on/swim in. Not a whole pile of cafes around for food. Sun loungers were very expensive. 
Sharon G,"Whyalla, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nice spot to start at and walk your little legs of for as far as the eye can see...sunsets are nice, lots of people very busy spot if you like lots tourists..."
Steve D,"Peyia, Cyprus",Jul 2016,"We spent the day here, great flat beach with plenty of beds.Cost of beds is about RP 100 for the day.Plenty of restaurants and toilets located along the beach, and lots of hawkers selling stuff.Also worth spending the evening here."
Tashaj31,"Pacific Coast Australia, Australia",Jul 2016,Seminyak Beach perfect for that stunning sunset shot. The  afternoons are busy with locals and visitors alike strolling the shore; swimming; surfing; or stopping off at the many hotel bars situated along the beachfront. Caution big strong surf during the day.  
chewy_candy,Jakarta,Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is always my fav because the flat sand and beautiful waves.  Not as many local sellers wander around as in Kuta. 
Allison F,11 contributions,Jul 2016,Too many tourists and people selling you things every 10min... Not recomended for a nap... You wont sleep much ^^
ujjwal41190,gurgaon,Mar 2016,not great for surfing..quiet place to relax.. I prefer Kuta (More people around) beach when it comes to surfing. 
Subiac0inni,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,At first I was not expecting too much as I am more of a swimmer than a surfer. Turns out renting a body surf board and just playing with the waves like the kids. Nice waves and water is not too deep. 
Always-travelling890,28 contributions,Jun 2016,I think a solution to the pollution running into the beach needs to be addressed. At times the beach really smells of sewage.
Flyholiday50,"Fethiye, Turkey",Jul 2016,Grabbed 2 beds and a umbrella from one of the many available. Paid 100k idr each which is double what we paid in Legian. Same sand same sea and surf but less crowded. Beer available from beach guy at 30k idr with stubby holder. Nice day had.
Jenjo2222,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,pleasant beach but it was just after they had a king tide come through so not much of the sand to be seen
MeeshellB,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Great place to come to relax enjoy a drink and watch the sunset. Numerous places to sit. I like the comfortable beanbags. Very casual relaxed atmosphere. Good for couples, families or in groups. Very inexpensive. "
DijohnWiltshire,"Salisbury, UK",Jul 2016,Had lunch at one of the restaurants on the beach which was ok. Obviously not suitable for swimming or really small children because of the waves which are used predominantly by surfers
Alba L,"Rivoli, Italy",Jul 2016,It was the nearest beach to the villa I rented it. Around Bali there are many beautiful  or passable . If you want to practice surf  they are suited to many  at south of the island .
Mo T,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2016,This is a great stretch of beach. Pretty clean and lots of great bars and restaurants if you walk back towards the airport. Well worth a visit. Good local food vendors at the end of the carpark catering to locals but happy to feed the hoards as well.
Marta B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"Clean and nice beach with coarse sand. Good for surfing, not too good to swim. A lot of nice places to get a fresh fruit juice at an amazing price. I enjoyed sunsets on the beach."
slatz1,"Rockingham, Australia",Jul 2016,Last day in Bali spent the afternoon at the beach. Few Bintangs and we hired a few body boards $5 aud each for unlimited use. Kids absolutely loved it. Wish we had spent more time there
Pramod50th,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,Seminyak Beach was a great place to remember . It was a very broad view of the scenic beauty all around & beautiful sun set to watch with many colours of the sky...really unforgettable ...loved it....
JulesnDan,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2016,So much rubbish on the sand here :(  not pretty.  There is also a construction site there atm  which makes it noisy and smelly.  Great market food though and lots of palm squirrels!
Grace GM,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"By Australian standards Seminyak beach is not the most beautiful beach you will see, in fact far from it.  The sand is grey and not attractive.  If there has been rain or storms there is rubbish on the beach.  The atmosphere in the afternoon and evening though is great with lots of beachfront bars, colourful bean bags and music.  Surf looked great but quite scary.  Not sure about the water quality but have been told it's not that clean."
Sergio P,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2016,Strong waves and currents so be careful when coming with kids! Best area is around La Plancha Beach Bar and Restaurant! Nice ambiance for sunset!
Jennifer,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Nice beach. It had rained for a few days when we first arrived so the beach was not great. Once the weather cleared the beach was less polluted and better for swimming. 
Darryl N,"Western Australia, Australia",Jul 2016,Firstly. Bali beaches are not a patch on beaches in Esperance Western Australia. Or even most Aussie Beaches for that matter. Now having said that it nice to sit and watch a sunset and drink a cold Bintang on the beach. And yes rubbish regularly washes up from Java with the water currents and on bad days they get tractors in to clean the beach. But in general a must thing to do is sit and relax and enjoy your holiday.
PocahontasTraveler,"Huntsville, AL",Aug 2015,The public beach is nice and there are a variety of restaurants!  You seem to need to purchase something to get a chair - but you can bring your own blanket and rest on the beach for free!
TCDHK,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,Nice beach on Bali with many top Hotels lining it. Friendly locals on the beach selling things and teaching you to surf.
Khun Fierman,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"A MUST IN BALI!Beautiful sunsets, clean beach and awesome vibe, with great bars and restaurants on the beach front. Another thing the waves is also nice. Good timing to come here around 5 pm. Bring along your mat and swimwears. Love this beach! "
catherine w,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2016,"Great beach day and night .Really good experience to walk along before sunset and find a good spot to sit and have a drink or two whilst looking at the  sun going down .Everyone goes down to the beach on a Sunday night to see the sunset , all the locals aswell as tourists and in the Indonesian school holidays it is jammed pack .Make sure you organize a good meeting spot if meeting up with friends as wifi and telephone reception is sometimes impossible to receive on the beach at busy times .Enjoy the beach its fabulous "
jassese,New Zealand,Jul 2016,"The water is lovely and warm and the photos posted show a beach paradise with gorgeous sunsets.  There is no question that Bali does have places like this but the shoreline from Kuta all the way up to Canggu has a terrible rubbish problem which comes off the streets and out via the streams.  I do not want to bag Bali as we have had a lovely time and the locals are amazing but do not come to Bali thinking it is pristine clean. I am not joking when I say you should make sure you have had your tetanus and Hep A shots if you plan on surfing or playing around the beach.  Bali is not unique, and this problem can be found all around SE Asia but it does not make it right.  If you are into surfing be prepared for the busy spots at peak holiday times."
El√≠n I,11 contributions,Jun 2016,Nice and clean beach with good restaurants and bars.Not recommended for swimming due to strong waves. Great for surfing and sunbathing.
traveladdict84304,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"This beach is not clean at all. The best beaches I have been to are in Esperance WA and the Whitsundays in Qld so I guess I have been spoiled. It's definitely  worth seeing for the culture though. Lots of places to eat, bands to listen to and things to do. "
Raka Mery H,Sweden,Jul 2016,"Easy for commuters, safe place for children to play , and many restaurant . I recommend to come to Sate Bali Seminyak at Kayu Aya Village, the food there was very great and nice service, Best for lunch and especially dinner after having a great time at the beach :)"
donmilmine,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2016,After taking hotel transfer to beach we were disgusted with the amount of rubbish lying around.  Beach actually closed for swimming!  Unfortunately local people do not appreciate how they are destroying their beautiful island with their (mainly plastic bag) rubbish.
fiona d,"Sidney, Canada",Jul 2016,"the beach was beautiful and easy to find nearest restaurant there, I recomended you to come to Sate Bali Restauran in Kayu Aya Village (near Flea Market) the food and treat was amazing, the JOGLO concept and wooden view are amazing..."
kevin l,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"Nice beach to watch the sunset, good surfing with some giant barrel's. On low tide the beach side restaurants and bars spill out onto the beach with beanbags, table's, umbrella's and sunbeds. Nice for a cold drink and a cool vibe but it gets very crowded.Watch out for several smelly stormwater/sewage? outlets that spill over the beach on the way to the ocean."
Alinta B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach itself is a gorgeous beach - wide clean beach with rolling surf (of various degrees).  It is bordered by big name hotels and restaurants, and some smaller places.  Sunset is gorgeous - morning is beautiful. "
Jas S,3 contributions,Jul 2016,"A MUST IN BALI.Beautiful sunsets and awesome vibe, with great bars and restaurants on the beach front.Go to La Plancha, great music amazing Tapas topped with nice drinks and comfy bean bags to chill on and watch the sunset."
Julie-Anne L,2 contributions,Jun 2016,This beach is not as nice as Sanur beach and it is very hard to access without going through one of the major hotels along the beach as there is limited access points. 
chyi,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,Good swells for surf enthusiasts. Walking distances to eateries and shops along multiple points in Seminyak. 
MasumMS,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jun 2016,"Confession: I only went there for the sunset, so don't know how it looks or how busy it is during daytime. For the sunset, it was not very busy, but there were enough people there not to make it feel deserted. Colorful restaurants with a lot of beanbags are there to enjoy the sunset from. I particularly enjoyed the walk on the beach away from the cafes after it got a bit dark."
Annaliese L,"Newlands, South Africa",Jul 2016,We lived spending time here both for swimming as well as having a party at night. Try to ignore the ever present traders or chat to them to find out about their lives ... . They are always friendly. The best time is at sunset when ons can sip cocktails and listen to live music 
Emma L,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"This beach is lovely, but very crowded! If you want to sit around with many other tourists and locals, this is the place for you! "
Anne M,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is great for renting a beach chair for the afternoon and lying back. Drinks can be purchased at the many beach shack Cafes along the beach. Enjoy the warmth in the middle of the Australian winter! üòä
Brandie,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2016,"We're staying at the W, so I can only speak of the beach around that area. I noticed some small ""rivers"" coming from hotels that kids were playing in, walked through it and realized it was sewage. Pretty gross and made me not want to be on the beach anymore. I'm not sure why anyone would think that was okay! People swim in there, gross all around. The sand is black from volcanoes, which is pretty cool to me. The waves were thrashing and not safe at all to get it, but pretty to look at. Also, it's pretty annoying to have people always trying to sell you something. I get people need to make money, but no one even carries money when they are swimming and if they do, they're not wanting to buy cheap stuff like that. Maybe get better stuff and be more subtle."
jenny s,"Portland, OR",Jun 2016,"The beach was really dirty when we were there. I'm not sure why they don't pay people to cleanup the beachfront, even the hotels don't clean up in their beaches out front."
AussieMike,"Acton Park, Australia",Jun 2016,"We have visited Seminyak beach twice - and have been twice too often! We are spoiled  with pristine white sand beaches at home - so the black volcanic sand just doesnt do it for us - further the sand is all hard packed down, and the ocean regularly claims victims .To top it off it is crowded with sun loving drunkards and locals selling all manner of tourist targeted products/services."
Ruth S,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is great for a morning stroll or for lazing with a book at La Lucciola,but don't go with the expectation that it will take your breath away.It's pretty in an understated way but not a once-in-a-lifetime beach experience."
663Mal,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nice beach, better than Seminyak itself. Can find a quiet place away from others. Watch for dangerous currents."
misscol,Waterford,Jun 2016,"Please be careful at this beach, we saw two people being rescued.Great surf, both watching and partaking in surfing. There were two rivers of raw sewage running into the ocean up the beach - the absolutely stink. "
Donna F,5 contributions,Jun 2016,Gawjus beach to go for a stroll  clean  very picturesque fantastic sunset well worth a visit for a stroll or a swim
Kathleen20012014,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,"Enjoyed getting away as we were able to get get BC flights and the CourtYard Marriott for a great price, but although the hotel was lovely, its more for families no quite areas.  It rained 4 out of the 6 days.  The beach spot for the hotel is too far away nea The Library on Seminyak beach.  Bali used to rain then a couple of hours and then its fine, not the case anymore. I have to say all the prices have gone up, but its still a great place.   Massages are still dirt cheap, together with Taxi and all in all the food is really of a high standard.  Plus no sickness at all.  I love Bali so in kind og bias as ive been going for so many years.  Seminyak is great shopping food and accommodation, what more can you ask for? Well nice weather would have been nice ...happy holidays!"
Anda H,"Ghimbav, Romania",Jul 2016,"We went yesterday at the public beach, via the Ku De Ta beach club. The sand is nice, the beach is clean, the chairs for relaxing in the sun are ok, bring your own towels and sit back enjoy the ocean. The water was perfect, hot , cool waves, had a lot of fun in the water. A perfect day at the beach. There are a lot of comerciants coming by, asking if you want to buy all kinds of things, fruits, watches, scarves, etc. Enjoy!"
Wendy G,"Box Hill, Australia",Jun 2016,"I'm not sure how this beach only gets four stars! Sure it's not an Australian beach but it's beautiful in its own right. A great way to walk from one location to another, always something to look at from the peanut seller, to the people hawking their wares (almost always politely), the beachside bars and restaurants, kids and families enjoying the water, day beds to settle in for the long haul of a tough day at the beach, people fishing and completely glorious sunsets."
JaneP08,"Dalyan, Turkey",Aug 2015,Lovely beach which is clean and well-maintained. Great vibe at the bars/hotels on the edge of the beach. Sunsets are stunning! Watch out in the hotels ... drinks are pricey!
Eveline K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Along the beach, there are many cafe with the live music and you can relax with your family and friends watching the sun goes down...oh...so happy"
Gabbster8,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,The beach is long and is great for a walkAnd superb for sunset. Of course it would be better without the sellers. If you walk south a couple of km you will be in Kuta which is full of annoying sellers. The more north you head you find great bars and restaurants on the beach.The long rolling waves are exquisite and it is no wonder it is famous for surfing. There are many rips which make swimming dangerous. Great to be in a hotel or bar overlooking this beach. 
Shane D,4 contributions,Jun 2016,"I enjoyed a walk along the beach , I was surprised how clean it was as when I was there previously in january a few years ago it was full of rubbish ."
rubyjude57,"Bendigo, Australia",Jun 2016,"First time on the beach after the rain, clean and lots of great waves. Hired sun beds from a beautiful family. Fresh coconut milk, massage and manicure..heaven the beach vendors were not too pushy either"
Sandra K,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Jun 2016,nothing like the australian beaches - quite dirty - maybe from the high tides - shopping strip was good
littlelipstickliv,17 contributions,Jan 2016,One of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen. Gorgeous beach with flawless views and lovely atmosphere
Pamela P,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,Fantastic surfing lessons with Made.  The children really excelled and were so happy.  Will return for more lessons and fun.
Margaret W,"Motherwell, UK",Jun 2016,"My favourite part of the holiday was sitting on the beach watching the magical sunsets.  Various bars line the beach, most have live music and excellent food.It was amazing!"
Elaine C,5 contributions,Jun 2016,"Manage to get a seat at 11am on tue morning. dont take reservations so do go early. food is good ordered the eggs bennedict and wrap, didnt like polenta fries though very bland? the juices are ok coffee soso, go for food instead"
Thaitimes,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"This beach has great surf and plenty of sun lounges for sale at a hefty price unless you are prepared to bargain. I'm unsure of the water quality but it was warm without being a bath.  Don't come here expecting white sands and blue water as you will be terribly disappointed. The tide was strong so I'm not sure I would take young children here.  There does not seem to be lifeguards around.  I guess I am spoiled by having some of the best beaches in the world at my doorstep in Australia. Anyhow, the surfers seemed to enjoy it."
DniDubh,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"This is a huge beach with a great selection of bars and surf board rentals. The waves are great for surfers or those who just wish to chill out. Sun beds and parasols can be rented cheaply. Sarong and souvenir sellers are a little tiresome. Pollution is a massive problem, especially during the rainy season. There is a sign that says it is a 'natural phenomenon', which is a complete lie. The rubbish is because of inadequate trash collection infrastructure and poor education and awareness about littering. Hopefully the situation will improve given recent campaigns on the island."
John M,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Seminyak attracts the higher end client with the larger resorts. But I find the beach to be dirty and smelly due the many creeks that flow into the ocean there. Nearby Legian in much cleaner.
Journeyfamily,"Western Australia, Australia",Jun 2016,"Every second person we passed were trying to sell us surfing lessons or deck chairs. I understand they are trying to make a living but I guess if you are looking for a relaxing stroll, this is not the place. Sand looked abit dirty and grey as well (maybe it was the weather? Was overcast). Otherwise, saw some big waves and people surfing. Wouldn't advise little ones. Lots of restaurants etc as well but they were closed when we were there (afternoon). "
Bossy24,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jun 2016,"So much fun to watch the goings on. Surfing for learners, easy peasy, lessons and boards available for rent beachside.Grab a beanbag at a bar 5.00pm onwards to watch the sunset and the kites flying overhead.  Whatever the roving vendors try and sell you offer less than half, to get to halfway. They will come down as you go up. Enjoy the bargaining and don't be mean."
Wes B,"Richmond, Canada",Jun 2016,During low tide this beach is great for the kids to play. You still have to be cautious though... we enjoyed lounging in our sun chairs while the kids collected shells and played.
cherylwoodson,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Seminyak has become overdeveloped like Kuta and Legain.  It's good for shopping, watching sunset and spending time a bars& cafes.  There are nicer beaches in the north west corner of Bali.  The beaches a bit further away are a lot nice"
Syantie,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2016,A lil bit far away from main street. About 15-20 mins drive from Sunset Rd depend on traffict.But it worth when you can catch sunset thereNot as hustle bustle as Kuta Beach
Arrigo B,"Milton, MA",Jun 2016,"We went for a stroll before sunset, so maybe we missed the key feature of this beach. We liked the setting, nice sand and we didn't noticed anything dirty, as reported by other reviewers. Zero approaches from beach vendors. Nice little temple in the back, which unfortunately we were not able to visit for inappropriate clothing.  Bars are everywhere: nothing uber-neat, just comfortable beanbags and lounge chairs. Rentals and surfing lessons. Overall, nice beach, seen better. "
veganrr,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2016,Quite a rough beach even during low tide. If you're looking for calm beaches then head to Sanur. This one is for the surfers.
Papartynas,"Glasgow, UK",May 2016,"Nice and clean. Not too busy, beach chairs as lottery- 1st day for 4 we paid 300k, next day 150K. Try to stay in same place, same fella so will get better price. Lifeguard was on duty , waves too big- telling to everyone get out from water- Perfect."
Jim B,Whittlesea,Jun 2016,Variety of eateries and bars catering for all tastes and budgets. Sunset viewing from the bean bags probably a must do - but was peeing down the night we attempted - so viewed from a bar/restaurant with bintang in hand!
Mike T,"Caroline Springs, Australia",Jun 2016,"Stunning beach and perfect place to start a walk from Seminyak all the way to Kuta if your up for it or the other way around. Takes about an hour to get from Legian to Seninyak at a reasonably slow pace enjoying the surroundings which include locals playing soccer, lanterns, bean bags, musicians, beach bar after beach bar and many many other things to see and take it all in. "
R_Sweden,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2016,"Very big and lively bech. Huge waves, perfect for surfers. You can hire surf lessons and gear every 10 meter. Lots of places to have a drink in the fantastic sunsets. Nice mixture of locals, tourists, dogs and everything else! "
ryandonoghue3,"Leeds, UK",Jun 2016,"If you are in Seminyak you absolutely must take in the sunset at Seminyak beach. On a clear day the view of the sunset beyond the crashing waves was one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. Just be aware, my partner and I went to the beach hoping to sunbathe and learn to surf, neither of which were possible as sunbathing isn't permitted on the majority of the beach (as you would be laid in front of one of the beach-side bars); also the waves are huge so swimming isn't allowed and I wouldn't surf unless you know what you're doing."
TrippingDuud,"Amsterdam, NY",Jun 2016,"Cool and relaxed beach with a nicer vibe than kuta beach. Still the same amount of merchants but more places with bean bags and music to chill. Waves are more lenghty than kuta as well, though it depends on the time i guess"
SweetPeaAdventures,"Pineville, NC",May 2016,"Best part of the beach was sunset. From our hotel, we could walk for 10 minutes and be in Seminyak beach where all the umbrella/beanbag restaurants were.  (Beanbag beach)  It was definitely pretty to see, and a good place to catch the sunset, but make sure you get a seat in the middle.  We unfortunately got seated in the front beanbag chairs and were harassed by hawkers all evening long.  Made for an unpleasant experience in what would of otherwise been a beautiful sunset experience. "
wawalover,Waarland,Jun 2016,To much dirt unfortunately. But still beautifull because of the heavy waves. Only Oberoi hotel has a nice and clean beachpart!
holiday_cruising62,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2016,"We has a very relaxing day on the beach , plenty things to see and watch the world walk by. Nice day highly recommend visiting Seminyak beach .."
AmyHickson,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,We have been to Bali many times but always stay in Nusa Dua or Ubud. We decided to finally check out Seminyak as it certainly draws some crowds. We entered the beach area and immediately weren't impressed. The beach was dirty and it smelt disgusting like sewerage we didn't even want to take our flip flops off. Having walked only a couple hundred meters we turned around and left the beach to get away from the smell. The furnishings along the beach where also very run down and in need of an upgrade with the beach umbrellas and chairs faded and ripped. 
snake43,"Victoria, Australia",Jun 2016,"great place to be for sunset, great cafe's, great bands good vibe about this place, pull up a bean bag and just watch the world go bye"
Ulf S,"Ume√•, Sweden",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach is wide and the sand is firm, perfect to walk on. Both the beach and the water is clean. However, it is quite big waves, great for surfers but not great for kids."
Dugg0,"Shepparton, Australia",Jun 2016,We went here for tea on a number of occasions as there are heaps of restaurants along the beach to choose. The surf does vary heaps so like any beach to keep an eye on kids and other family members.  There are heaps of hawkers that ply their trade along the beach so just say no and then continue to sip away on that Bintang and they move on!!!
NatalieAdelaide,Adelaide,Jun 2016,"So many beach bars and restaurants, all with a great vibe and friendly staff.  Comfy bean bags on the beach, or table and chairs inside the restaurant.  Your choice."
Thomas C,"Paris, France",Jun 2016,"Seminyak beach is not as crowded as kuta. Definitely a good choice if traveler want a less crowded and not noisy beach. There are people that rent beach chair for 200k/hour. Try to negotiate the price, 200k is to expensive especially for domestic tourist. Overall the place is quite good especially at night."
A J,"Hobart, Australia",Jun 2016,"This is a typical tourist hot spot beach in Bali.  Hire a longe and watch the world go by, or more likely come to you to purchase everything you may need on the beach, hats, food drinks and even a kite! The waves can be pretty big so take care and don't forget the sunscreen.  Beachside restaurants are many and vary in style and price."
Maree H,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2016,"During day not too many hawkers, easier to swim compared to Kuta and surf is great for learners. At nighttime the place is surreal and you get incredible food and pictures as it turns into an Ibiza with a sea of beanbags, musicians, and food and booze. "
travelminions,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2016,The beach is extremely long. The wave is so strong that it's twice as high as an adult height. Should be a good place for surfing. A nice spot to see sunset. We saw a couple taking pre-wedding shoot on the beach. Probably not private enough for sun bathing. Not is a safe place for leisure swimming due to the strong wave. Sand looks pretty dark but feel soft and powdery on feet. 
Neatesy,193 contributions,Jun 2016,"Great place to say goodnight to the sun after a sunny hot day..sitting in bean bags listening to live music, sipping on cold cocktails and beer feeling like the world you left behind is miles away...."
mikeyp3,"Bath, UK",Jun 2016,The beach is relatively quiet with lots of room to walk and occasional places to eat or just sit and have a drink. The sea is generally safe. 
Lee M,48 contributions,Jun 2016,Great location close by many amenities in Seminyak. Worth a visit especially if you like a surf. Nice sand to relax on and certainly worth a paddle. 
Mark M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Great to relax in the evening to watch sunsets whilst enjoying a meal or having a drink.Most offer entertainment and really large beanbags to slouch in.You will be bombarded by people selling trinkets but they soon move on if you don't pay any attention.
Marzee29,"Caroline Springs, Australia",Jun 2016,great views for a great sunset.....very colourful with all the lounges and umbrellas and the music is good too...sit back and relax with a cocktail and watch the sun go down...magicial
Raj G,368 contributions,Jun 2016,"The seminyak beach is one of he best in Bali for surfing lovers , sunsets lovers and beach side restaurant lovers ! The water is tho' not clear and clean for a bath but still better than many beaches in Bali . "
leemE1734ST,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"Its hard to get to from the main road, unless you want to walk through Potato Head (careful as your water is taken off you)"
kunjie17,4 contributions,Jun 2016,"Had a hard time finding the entrance to the beach from the main road as the resorts were lining the stretch between the road and the beach. No clear signages for us to locate entrance as well. We finally backtracked for 4 mins and found a small entrance through Ke De Ta. Coconut was very fresh and cooling which was a big plus for a hot afternoon. But sunbed had to be haggled with the vendors (there were many of them along the beach) and we got a pair of beds at 50,000IDR for an hour. The beach was clean and nice to walk along the edge of the waves along the shoreline. It wasn't too crowded and was overall an enjoyable experience! would go back again"
Peter Maccormick oam,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Pity the beach is  not clean with a lot of Rubbish some no doubt caused by the storm but there appears that'd the locals make no effort to tidy it up !!
Beach Bum B,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2016,The beach at Seminyak is gorgeous. Not nearly as noisy or busy as Kuta beach and offers all that and more. The waves there are more gentle and the water seems warmer. Sun beds and umbrellas are available for renting. The beach is broad and sandy and sandy and stretches for many km's in either direction.
janineh165,"Ballarat, Australia",Jun 2016,"Coloured beanbags & umbrellas line the sand, The food at the restaurants on the beach is wonderful, a great place to kick back, unwind with a drink and enjoy stunning sunsets."
David & Tricia,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"When you walk onto the main beach of Kuta, Legain or Seminyak they all offer similar things, beach lounges, cold beer & umbrellas but the exception is Seminyak it has more atmosphere with a lot of eateries along the beach.Ps. A great way to walk between Kuta, Legian & Semiyan is along the beach or the back streets close to the beach."
GavinJohn59,"Fingal, Australia",May 2016,"with all the hundreds of millions of dollars that come  into Bali surely they could upgrade the most filthiest, vile, disgusting toilets that we have ever been into, they probably a hundred years old and have never been cleaned and they have the cheek to charge you   lift your game Indonesia "
Benvantaylor,"Manchester, UK",Jun 2016,"I'm here now on the beach in Seminyak chilling listening to the waves. The beach is very relaxed with plenty of beds to choose from. It costs about ¬£10 for 2 beds for the day and a btl of water is about 50p. There is plenty of food places along the beach to grab a snack, they are OK for a sandwich and drink.The sea at the moment is quite rough so be careful, the waves don't look that big but when your underneath it, it's a very different story. It is however very warm so that's a plus point. If you want to learn to surf you can do which also is cheap. The people along the beach are very friendly and we had a foot massage yesterday from Kitty who was very good, she painted my toe nails very nice also. There is lots of sellers down the beach, they mean no harm just trying to earn a living they all have hats with their names on and some stuff is ok what they are selling. I like this place because everyone is welcome and nobody cares what you look like. It's not like Cancun where you have to make an effort to go to the beach. At night the beach bars have live music where you can watch the sunset, very relaxing.‚ù§Ô∏è"
hrishi2016,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",May 2016,Semiyank beach is very clean and beautiful and offers a nice view of the sunset. There are a number of bars on the beach.
Candice B,42 contributions,Jun 2016,Had a lovely time at the beach but the prices of food and drinks in the area are steep! Had to drive 10 minutes on the scooters to find food under 50 IDR
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,"You can get great food ,and have a drink, while sitting on a beanbag and watching the sun go down, Very relaxing way to start your evening."
JennyJ52,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"Beaches are great, restaurants fabulous, bean bags all along the beach to sit and enjoy and drink or two."
Ma-manators,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,Took a stroll to the beach after breakfast. Short walk away from our hotel but it was easy to locate. Great atmosphere and good location for surfing!
tiffanydeborah,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Jun 2016,Many bars and beach clubs along the beach. Loved the beach as it is in general rather clean. It has beautiful and fun waves especially for surfers! 
feliciagraciouz,"Angers, France",Jun 2016,"It's always active, I mean crowded.. Even in the nighttime..However, with the low light in the night, you can still feel the romantic ambiance..Sitting in the bean bags and have 'some' mojito üòâYou can also light up a sky lantern, there usually are some guys who walk along the beach to sell for IDR 90k.."
Jack W,38 contributions,Jun 2016,Very busy huge waves so very good for surfers but no good for those who want to chill out and have a swim. Sand is black. Beach very busy with poor quality restaurants selling overpriced food and drinks. I wouldn't go back to this beach - much nicer ones only a short moped journey away. 
Manish K,46 contributions,Jun 2016,I visited the beach with my family on morning and was surprised to find it dirty. Not expected such standard fron bali beaches. It was stinking as sewage was entering sea from one of the places. One can go to other beaches. Not recommended at all
Glen D,"Mumbai, India",May 2016,Got there early to avoid the sun and found the beach deserted with a few blokes going through their fitness regime.
Kylie_fnqphotography,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2016,"Beautiful beach, has a really nice little bar with an awesome view. Great place to go for a walk and watch the sun go down. The local people are all very friendly. "
Julien P,"Boulogne-Billancourt, France",Jun 2016,"The beach here is quite dirty, smells like sewers at times. I would not recommend you are better off by staying at the good bars and resorts with swimming pools in front"
Hussein I,"Beirut, Lebanon",Jun 2016,Lovely sunset... but waves are just too high to enjoy a swim. You can simply walk down the beach romantic view. But most beaches are dirty since waves are high... drafts more garbage to the shore. 
Bella C,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2016,"What a wonderful beach to walk along especially at sunset & people watch! There are models in wedding dresses ankle deep in water or mounted on ponies, people swimming or surfing, people rod fishing, flying kites, playing football, drinking cocktails at the endless strip of beach bars & on it goes!"
graham a,3 contributions,Jun 2016,Loved the clean waves. Walking distance to beach clubs. No beach hustlers like kuta beach. We enjoyed a cold beer from Potato Head.
SabHei,3 contributions,Jun 2016,The beachside of Seminyak was beautiful and rounded our holiday up. With many activities and restaurants it has something for every taste.
Tayla A,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"This beach is great to watch the sunset and sit at one of the many beachside bars and restaurants. Most of them have cushions and beanbags to sit at and enjoy the beach views. The beach is clean but watch out for your belongings as this place has a reputation for pickpocketing. There are a lot of people on the beach trying to sell you things. It's best to bargain the price at least to 50% and definitely say no if you don't want it because they are very pushy. Other than that, this beach is great for the whole family. "
Andre N,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2015,Pantai yang cantik cuma terlalu ramai. Probably kerna saya dan teman-teman ke sana pas malam New Year. We had fun its just that hujan renyai-renyai buat rasa kurang enak. But the party went on until late of course.Seminyak is a definite beach to visit when you are in Bali. Looove it. Will definitely come back.
Dasmesh Singh B,116 contributions,Jun 2016,"High waves, can't really swim but it's beautiful to just visit. Alot of people thou. Other beaches like nusa dua and jimbaran are more beautiful calm and nice to go into the water."
wwstraveler,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2016,"Beach was ok but nothing special.  Felt dirty. I am sure the sunsets are awesome, we were here in the morning., "
Rahul J,"Varanasi District, India",May 2016,The beach is very famous among the locals. It was very much crowded. No water sports at the beach...
NolaEng,"Malvern, Australia",May 2016,"As always this is a fabulous stretch of beach that offers loads of fun, surf and relaxation. You can choose a cafe and sit in the comfy beanbag seats, order an ice cold Bintang, even a snack and listen to the music of choice. The best..is to sit on the beach and watch the amazing sunsets or go for a walk in the early morning and watch the sun come up."
Mark B,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2016,"The beach like all beaches in Asia does have some local rubbish on it, but most mornings local contractors do clean up the majority of it.The water quality is good and the surf break quite large."
Mary Neville,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2016,"Seminyak beach had some wonderful views, and from a distance was picturesque. Upon further inspection, however, there was a rather obnoxious smell that, whilst initially unforthcoming, I found to be more apparent the closer I reached to the water..it was at this point I realized swimming would be a poor choice. Other tourists didn't seem to mind, so if you're adventurous at heart-by all means, have a gander! "
Sharnee H,8 contributions,Jun 2016,"Great place to visit with the kids, I even managed to get around with my double stroller. Restaurants are a lil bit pricy for a family if comparing to the rest of Bali. "
Jacqueline M,79 contributions,Jun 2016,We were at Double Six beach two days back as compared to that Seminyak Beach was much cleaner and quieter. You won't be harassed too much by vendors. I like Seminyak Beach better.
Melanie J,"Norah Head, Australia",May 2016,"Not very clean beach unfortunately. Hoping to get a surf and relax, but not much relaxing with locals trying to sell you there items and beach crowded with learn to surf schools"
Rebecca V,Lake Macquarie Australia,May 2016,"I struggle to think of anything nice to say about Seminyak beach but as I hate negative reviews I'll try to be objective;Pros: Plenty of dining options/beach clubs. Plenty of nearby accommodation. Cons: Ugly beach - black sand. Far nicer beaches to be found elsewhere in Bali, even Kuta is much prettier. I would not visit again Seminyak Beach again."
xronis,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"waters warm not my type but great for learning to surf as this is really shallow. good for kids and family , be careful with the sun as its black sand"
Jo C,London,May 2016,"What a lovely  beach, long and sandy. Safe bathing as long as you take note of the flag colours. Quite  awesome surf. Sun set is a fantastic sight from beach. If fit you can walk along the waters edge all the way  to Cuta beach."
Johannes V,9 contributions,May 2016,"Clean than Kuta but not as nice as Jimbaran Beach.. Waves are good for surfers, but make swimming dangerous"
Sam G,15 contributions,May 2016,"Not the best beach I've been too but it's OK bit choppy for me, there are toilets on the back of the beach and also food and drink stalls and it's very cheap, women come round the beach selling fresh fruit and cold drinks which is a bonus"
Vilks,39 contributions,Jun 2016,The ocean here is special with a kilometer of rolling surf tubes which can feed your soul for hours. Unfortunately the beach sand is filthy and grey water drains directly into the beach so risky to let kids play here.
Bseblgrl3,"Seattle, WA",May 2016,Wonderful beach to walk and warm water to wade in. The current is strong so be prepared to be pulled in by the lifeguard if you swim outside designated areas. Great for boogie boarding + surfing.
Fabian Y,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,This beach is not so crowded as compared to kuta. And it is a great place to view the sunset when happen around 6pm local time. There is a carpark and a few restuarants beside the beach.
jrnewson,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard and used Seminyak beach as the hotel has a private facility with sun lounges. Generally all the beaches are clean and have bars and resturants attached which makes it very enjoyable.
Harley E,"Clear Island Waters, Australia",May 2016,"It's a lovely beach, with a great sunset. Lots of umbrellas and chairs to hire to stay out of the sun, some of the people selling get annoying  and a bit of rubbish but still really nice beach"
Ella C,240 contributions,May 2016,Such a great beach with a range of restaurants and seating to chose from! It's really nice to see that this beach is really well looked after! The sun loungers are a little expensive however if you are staying for the whole day it's well worth getting one with an umbrella too because that sun gets super hot! The sand is so nice and soft and looks like it sparkles! So many people out surfing and lots of places to hire a board for an hour or so!In the evening lots of beanbags are placed on the beach under really cute umbrellas and lots of lights. Definitely a nice spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat. Would recommend checking this beach out you won't be disappointed! 
Sue P,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Having a beer at sunset a magical place to beThe beach is a lot cleaner than it has been for a long time , great to watch the beach sellers go about their business"
JoffG,"London, UK",May 2016,Though views are great and you have some amazing waves some parts of the beach smell as if some sewage is dumped there. Better hope the wind blows in the right direction. 
samrox5,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"Great for viewing the sunset. Not for swimming, water cloudy & not that great. Plenty of surfers though & bars & restaurants. "
Katerinka S,2 contributions,Apr 2016,"good for surfing, i'm a beginner but met profi there too, also clean, but not that good for swimming, view is perfect! sunsets are very nice "
travellers7406,"Northamptonshire, UK",May 2016,"The beach is great except for the plastic! The beach guys do as much as they can to clear it up after the tides gone out but there's still so much. People should be soley employed to clean the beach and take the rubbish away. Helpful for the environment and it would provide employment.?With the amount of revenue that Bali is receiving from tourism, it's time for the Indonesian government to step up on the waste problem. The sea around Bali is heavily polluted with plastic. We saw three dead turtles whilst travelling in Indonesia, and were informed that the most common cause of a turtles premature death in those waters in due to ingesting plastic. Seminyak beach is covered in tiny pieces of plastic and polystyrene which ends up in marine life's stomachs. Which is wonderful for the local people who rely on fish for protein. We spoke to many fishermen who are outraged by this horrendous rubbish problem in the ocean. Playing in the waves you feel rubbish brushing past you and it's just not pleasant. One day we didn't even go in the sea as there was so much rubbish! There needs to be recycling facilities that are readily available and free for hotels in Seminyak and all of Bali. We saw local people raiding bins outside hotels for plastic bottles and cans, surely these could at least be left out for them!? We couldn't even find anywhere in Seminyak where we could refill our plastic water bottles. Human waste is also released into the sea all around Bali via the sewer pipes that go down the beach and out to sea.Also watch the current at Seminyak beach. Great for us surfing and body boarding but we also saw three separate occasions where life guards had to rescue people who had been taken out by the current. Great fun in the big waves but just be careful. "
lilliespearlzroses,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",May 2016,"So much fun, you rock up at night, find a bean bag and order a bintang!! Honestly just look around and get a vibe for spot that feels right to you."
NZ_yams,queenstown,May 2016,Big and spacious with plenty to offer. Great for sunsets too. Lots of touts but they are easily avoided. Brilliant space for children. 
Jony128,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",May 2016,"Seminyak beach is a city beach. Hence, you will not find a clear water and white sandy beach. However, it does offer a great swell and surfing waves for the surfers out there. For those people not used to beaches, it will be great. For those like me looking for outstanding beaches, consider Virgin Beach."
Ross&JessL,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Great at night time bands playing , bean bags to sit on listen to music , the quieter one is the coffee lounge sign on it I think it's capil beach restaurant our favourite on Tuesday Wednesday  , they all offer music and dinner it's nice to eat on the beach , move around to different ones see which one you like but great at night time "
Mar,"Zielona Gora, Poland",Jan 2016,"wide sandy beach, but unfortunately quite dirty; very expensive beach chairs and umbrellas - especially at the entrance to the beach"
Michelle M,"Blue Mountains, Canada",May 2016,"We stayed for 5 days at The Royal Beach Resort in Seminyak and it was absolutely perfect for us.  The area is very beautiful, the beaches are lovely and the water warm but very rough.  No swimming for 5 days but you could go in the surf and play close to shore.  It is quite touristy which we did not like...crowded, lots of people trying to sell you stuff all the time...whenever we left our resort, we were inundated with offers from vendors.  However our resort was like a slice of paradise...quiet, secluded, charming, authentic Balinese culture and food."
TiaKaiYen,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,"First time here, nice beach with manageable waves (ard 1pm, high tide)... Coz I can't really swim so strong waves are scary. Lovely weather, great for sun tanning. Lots of locals trying to sell handicrafts, common culture in Thai beaches too. Apparently they sell slightly more expensive than the shops, and definitely have to bargain to lower the prices. "
FloBotticelli,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2016,The beach is clean and the sunset is just awesome! Nature at its best.. The beautiful display of colours combined with the clouds is just breathtaking.
Alison S,"Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2016,"Good bars for lively fun but might be too busy for those requiring a more relaxed atmosphere. Not far to walk to quieter beaches though, giving you options."
Wombler661,"Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2015,"The beach is a bit narrower than Legian + Double Six Beaches, however it backs onto some great spots where entertainment, food and drink are all well placed. "
AnaByn,"Makati, Philippines",May 2016,Great sunset and can visit and have a drink in the big hotels like Potato Head or W hotel!!! love this
Derek Y,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",May 2016,"Plenty of touts so just be careful on Seminyak Beach.After Kuta, I would say the Seminyak is the next busiest beachin Bali. A must to come to this beach to soak in the sea breeze and at the same time to experience all the beach side vendors.They sell anything ranging from Sarongs to Hats to Sunglasses.Some of the nice eateries found here are also a must try as they serve some very nice food at reasonable prices. "
Cassiijoy,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2016,There is nothing better than a sunset on Seminyak Beach - we had to do it several times.  Do yourself a favour.
Elaine A,"Taguig City, Philippines",Jan 2016,"Witnessed Bali sunset here in Seminyak, the place was a bit crowded but still nice. There are lots of restaurants and hotels near the area. "
Tony H,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,Much better than Kuta beach. A lot cleaner and not so crowded. The bean bag bars are fantastic which contributes to the atmosphere. Great for just a nice walk too. Don't miss this jewel.
Robert O,"Bangor, ME",May 2016,"Went to the beach which gets crowded around sunset.  The waves were huge, about eight to ten feet high.  The tide was going out and it was amazing how strong and long the tidal suction lasted...atleast twenty seconds.  The sand is light brown and there are plenty of beach chairs you can rent.  "
Aasiqui Y,3 contributions,May 2016,"so relaxerd, great service at the bars, not too expensive, you sit right up towards the beach, friendly atmosphere and great food too."
Steve W,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"The beach and attending cabana's and drink/food huts were terrific compared to 3 years ago.  The beach was always clean, the people (locals) very friendly and helpful.  The hire of the beach beds was very reasonable and at the right ones they even delivered your Bintang direct as you needed it.  We had a great few days down there during our stay."
CR5Vacations,"Montmorency, Australia",May 2016,Great surfFriendly beach lounge owners Constant interruptions from beach sellers a little annoying after a whileSand okWater a lovely temp (early May)
Andrew S,"Johannesburg, South Africa",May 2016,"This beach is a must for beach lovers. You can learn to surf of just swim in the waves for miles of beautiful beach and sea. Every afternoon, the beach is transformed into a magical atmosphere of bean bags and live music for you to enjoy magnificent sunsets. The prices are very reasonable and the service is good. A definite must. "
KAYLONDON88,"Stratford City, UK",May 2016,might have been because we went in a quite season but the atmosphere was calm and there was not much to do.
murrayjt,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,It was a change for us to go to a more quieter part of bali. eat street was good plenty to choose from.shopping not a big thing with me enough though for my wife.
Hans Frederik B,"Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway",May 2016,"Much better than Kuta beach, and the sellers are less nagging. Nice restaurants by the beach and nice personell."
Mick S,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Lots of quality improvements in relation to the water and beach over recent years.  The after dark scene is amazing. Such great restaurants where you get to sit in bean bags and eat and drink.  Live bands play - acoustic sets mainly and it has a real friendly vibe. This is your over 30s beach.  Safe. Clean and drug free.
Starbelly B,36 contributions,May 2016,"The water looked pretty dirty and the sand wasn't great. I've seen worse but I've also seen much, much better. I personally wouldn't bother swimming here and I'd be dubious about sticking my head under water. Having said that, it's not unpleasant to go for a walk along."
Joy M,327 contributions,Mar 2016,"Eh, I don't hate this beach. I love the little evening local market that pops up near the public parking lot. But the beach can be kinda dirty. But it's way better than Kuta!"
malexandral,"Cranbrook, Canada",May 2016,We've had some great days just lazing in the sun! They have great food at the little restaurants in the evening for watching the sun set. Let's of trinket vendors if you don't feel like shopping for the people back home but you have to get them 'something'! They also have grilled corn in the parking lots and coconuts for drinking for the perfect beach pictures!
Kristine V,"Grimstad, Norway",May 2016,"Beach it self is really nice but we got so annoyed with those sellers! Has a lot of places where to sit, have a drink and watch sunset."
Marno S,34 contributions,May 2016,"Soft sand, great waves, relaxed atmosphere.Sunset is great with few drinks, music and a bean bag...Beach is clean and feels safe at night              "
Sole L,9 contributions,May 2016,"If you have been to good beaches in Australia, this one is very average. Unless your surfing. Go to Nusa Dua. Dirty sand and big waves here."
Caitlin G,84 contributions,May 2016,"One of the cleanest beaches among Kuta/Legian etc. The hotels are more up market and take pride in the cleanliness of the beach outside of their establishments. There are always waves, people and sun beds to rent. The weather never disappoints and a picturesque sunset will be seen on most nights. If in the area, it is definitely worth a visit."
Heather V,"Mackay, Australia",Apr 2016,"great place to enjoy the sunset, and grab a cheap meal from one of the many 'restaurant"" on the beach "
Chimanlal P,"Harrow, UK",May 2016,The beach has brown and black Sand..good for surfing as waves are strong. There are many places on the beach plus the drinks
ever0d,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,"Sunny Seminyak Beach, we were lucky to have some very nice waves during our time there, it can be a busy beach, with plenty of people, surf boards, beach lounges and umbrellas, but there is still plenty of room to relax.  Watch the sunset in the evening from the bean bags on the beach or the cafes on the beach best place to be around 5pm."
Pegasus1129,Jakarta,May 2016,"Excellent place to hang out with family or friends especially when you chasing the sunset. The view always perfect in Seminyak area, nice lounge music from cheap to expensive cafe.nice environment and hundreds of good restaurant."
Maureen T,"Townsville, Australia",Apr 2016,"We arrived at Seminyak Beach mid afternoon in a cab, it was easy to access as we had been sick for a few days. The scene was magic, beautiful ocean & weather, we hired a couple of lazy boys to lay on for the time we were there & the beach was busy. Then came the hawkers selling their goods,  we were sorry we bought the first item from them, we were harassed by them for quite some time"
09Realist,"Bunbury, Australia",May 2016,"While it looks very picturesque when the sun is setting the beach is heavily littered and, with open drains running across it and entering the ocean, the idea of swimming was unattractive"
Glick76au,"Hoppers Crossing, Australia",May 2016,Nice beach once you negotiate the right rate for a deck chair. We had a great day lounging around a nod a few dips in the surf. The hawkers were a bit annoying but you get that. 
Kaiser2290,"Bristol, UK",May 2016,"The beach is quite flat, with little character to it. It is simply filled with hundreds of sunbeds and its hard to find a spot on the beach where you wont hear blaring music! Good for thise who just want to drink in the sun, but not for those who want to relax! The current is very strong here, so if youre not a good surfer, you may find it very tough and daunting to learn here as you'll get chucked about a lot!!!"
msharma1969,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2016,We visited  other beaches like nusa dua and another private one whose name I don't remember but this one was the best of all 
Samantha K,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2016,My first time experiencing a beach with strong waves that I couldn't do anything in the sea. I don't surf so all I did was just lay by the beach and also workouts. 
jennpf,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Lovely beach. Clean sand. Quiet and peaceful. You will not be harassed to buy things or have massages etc like Kuta. It is quite calm. The water is not calm and can get rough. Be careful if you are not a strong swimmer or have small children. Some sections are patrolled by the lifeguard. 
pamelamY8048LY,"Golden Grove, Australia",May 2016,"You simply must visit the beach at sunset to watch the sun go down as you enjoy a drink on one of the many beanbags provided.  Table service , cheap drinks and a wonderful atmosphere."
MissM,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,he beach is 3 minutes walk from the villa and an early morning walk is a great way to start the  day- before the stresses of massages and swimming and reading!
Mary T,"Rockingham, Australia",May 2016,its very dirty lots of people pestering you if i had children would not let their feet touch the floor
LondonLola1,london,May 2016,"This beach could be great with a little care and attention. There are several beach bars at night where you can enjoy live music, however some of the acts compete to be heard and if sitting in one bar the sound of that bars entertainers can be drowned out by the musicians of the bar next door. Also the beach could do with a bit of a tidy up. Beds charged at 100,000 IDR for two which you can try to negotiate as it works out to be abt ¬£8.00 and you can get a meal for two for that price."
MarkWilliams63,"Tweed Heads, Australia",May 2016,"Great Cantina just up from W resort . Cheap drinks and food . The food is also really good  . Hire a lounge for 50000 for as long as you like . The beach itself is a little dangerous so be careful . Strong currents can drag you around . A little dirty at low tide . Alot of plastic and other rubbish on the beach . Great for the Bali sunsets as well . Great fun , but be careful in the water."
elementary1969,161 contributions,May 2016,Seminyak beach is a nice Long clean beach with many restaurants and bars along the beach. You can rent out loungers and umbrellas for a modest cost for the day. The sand is a dark Colour but clean. You will find many locals selling their products along the beach ranging from coconuts to art to kites. In the evening a number of the bars and restaurants put out chairs so you can dine on the beach itself. There is quite a strong current and strong waves at parts of the beach so some care is needed and close supervision of children.
eliforyou,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",May 2016,Totally loved my surfin. For beginners and intermediates this is a perfect spot to learn and improve.
roseymaher,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Surf beach. Little bit dirty. Nothing special and wasn't worth making a special trip for. If you stayed next door to the beach u might visit
MattAitchison,"Aberdeen, UK",Apr 2016,"Myself and my girlfriend were expecting a pristine white beach with a couple of cool bars, so we were slightly disappointed. More of a mediterranean style Spanish beach with sometime pretty awful live music at every bar during the night (which is played on individual stages with massive speakers so you can't really have a nice chilled conversation). Not what we expected it to be - if you want a chilled out paradise vibe, Gili Trawangan is an absolute must.  "
Paulette W,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Apr 2016,"Fruit, drinks, pedicures, manicures, hair braiding, relaxing, shopping, reading, sleeping, in the shade, in the sun.... Etc.Wonderful!"
Sinisa K,"Belgrade, Serbia",Apr 2016,"I didnt like  this beach, looks very dirty .Very bad smell.If u  want  white sands  and blue water this is not  that area!"
Sema_KM,"Istanbul, Turkey",Mar 2016,"The beach is rather clean. People come from the temple to the beach on a regular basis for the morning and the evening prayers. The sea is extremely wavy. If you want to go for a swim, be prepeared for a tiring battle. There are life guards present all the time to keep you away from the danger zones. "
MGP03,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Visited Seminyak beach for our first day in Bali and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of hawkers and people. Water was beautifully warm with some decent waves for an old bloke. As long as you don't expect pristine white sand you should enjoy the experience!
Geehee,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Apr 2016,We enjoyed a morning walk along Seminyak Beach but I definitely wouldn't say its one of the nicer ones ive seen in the world. There were many stray dogs and the water was quite dirty. It was fine for a walk though and quite a social experience!
Mike C,8 contributions,Sep 2015,Beach was ballin. Huge beach with tons of ppl. Lounge chairs available would pay more then $15 CAD for the day. 
Beanie W,"Middlesborough, null, United Kingdom",Apr 2016,Bit smelly from the river a little further down flowing into the sea. Tourists are ruining it by littering without care and the lounge chairs are a little more expensive than Kuta beach. 
Byron E,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Not the best beaches in the world, Phuket being much much better and not like Boracay with its white sand. I would say it's an ugly beach, but clean and plenty of food along the beach. Also plenty of water activities available, but again not as good as you'd find in Phuket. I don't know why people come to Bali as its overpriced now and even beach side meals in local owned restaurants are around AUD$7-10 a meal, beer about AUD$4-5 a bottle (Phuket equivalent is less than half that). People are nice, and not annoying trying to sell u stuff but not pushy. What it lacks are beach massages like in Phuket, and definitely not as nice. See photos and you'll see what I mean. "
Jessica,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,"Ok so the beach isn't that beautiful. The sand isn't white and the water isn't turquoise like a beach you would find in Australia, however the atmosphere is relaxed, the sunsets are to die for and there are loads of restaurants, bars along the beach, many of which have live music playing and great cocktails. You don't come here for the beauty of the beach as much as you would for the atmosphere. It's lots of fun and worth a visit. "
carolbali,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,Plenty of bars & restaurants along the beach with great views. Popular area with learn to surf schools.Loads of beach lounges for hire. Beach itself is dark sand and locals try to remove rubbish from the area.Good place to park your bum and watch the day go by.
Jenni W,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Apr 2016,"The beach at Seminyak is a mix of fun in the water, lazing on the beach (with a cool drink), buying a bargain from the friendly sellers & experiencing the amazing Bali sunset in a comfy chair/beanbag. It's the best! Stay at Pelangi Bali & this beautiful beach is on your doorstep! I've already booked again for later this year..... can't wait! üòéüå¥üèÑüèªüëôüèäüèºüç¥üëç"
Whitney H,Cronulla,Apr 2016,Gets very busy on the beach Sundays when the locals come down to play their friendly soccer matches and bring their families for a swim
StanlyNapoleon,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"a good for sunset viewing and just walk through the coastal line.So many good caf√©, bars or just a place to relaxed and unwind yourself."
sandjasmine,"Toronto, Canada",Jan 2016,Nothing much but beautiful. There are eating places adjacent to the beach. It's quiet and has beautiful sunrise.
Jenny M,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,"Quieter, cleaner and less hawkers than Legian and Kuta beaches. Lots of little beach caf√©s to stop at for a Bintang or a cool drink"
Prest0n26,"Perth, Australia",May 2016, A very interesting part of Seminyak big waves with beautiful water ideal for swimming or surfing all year round
Abby L,58 contributions,May 2016,"Purposely avoided Kuta to get away from the crowd, yet not wanting to miss out on the nightlife happenings in Bali... So chose this place to stay instead. Really enjoyed the beanie bags prepared by the beach at night while listening to live bands."
59_lee,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",Oct 2015,"OK, Liked the fact, most places, that sold food drinks etc, had a decent toilet facilities....  didnt like the sun bed owners, trying ""it on""  IE charge what ever price, that suits them. Or you have to batter!!!!!!  Not for a sun lounger.."
50Debbie50,"Pretoria, South Africa",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach in front of the Alila Hotel was perfect for walking, running and even for a shallow swim. Lots of activity on  the beach near 6 o clock as people settle to watch the sunset."
dakotamorton,55 contributions,Apr 2016,"After hearing some not so pleasant things about Kuta beach, I can't say how happy we were to be close to Seminyak Beach. Very clean, and lots of little spots to chuck a towel down if you want to pay $70,000+ for beach-chairs. "
ptk_from_dy,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"Staying at Seminyak we had 3 options to get to Legian/Kuta; taxi, walk the street or my favourite - walk down and up the beach! Less crowded, cooler and way more enjoyable.  Walk up the beach to Ku De Ta or Potato Head!  And at sunset - listen to live music, sit in a bean bag and sip on some cool drinks!  Perfect way to end the day and start the evening!"
Lauren M,"Canberra, Australia",May 2016,"Went a few times to have a drink as the sun went down, was quite nice to see the sun set and listen to some live music. In terms of the actual beach it was very dirty, lots of rubbish. The surf was very choppy and shallow. Don't swim there unless you're a strong swimmer, make sure to swim between the red and yellow flags, there are lifesavers but they don't seem to pay much attention. Certainly wouldn't allow children to swim unless they were very good swimmers. If you are looking for a clean and beautiful beach this is not the place, go down to the southern beaches (around Uluwatu and nusa dewa). But mind you I am Australian so I am used to some very beautiful beaches!"
Maksym S,23 contributions,Apr 2016,What a beach! We were coming here every day for about 5 last days in a row! Beach boys are always ready to talk nad make for you some great price for the beach chair or Surf rent... And it was not so crowded as Kuta... much more less sellers of sarongs and pedicure services! Surfing was great! And absolutely amazing sunsets with nice cold beer or cocktail on the soft chair with lounge music! Loved this place! 
tazzi74,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2016,Was a nice beach to go for a swim and get a cold beer and watch the sun set but i dont rate the beaches as good as the ones we have in Australia.Local people are fantastic and always willing to help out.
flymetothemoon123,"Mumbai, India",May 2016,"Great beach especially if you're staying in Seminyak. But it's usually packed during the daytime so if you're looking for a more quiet or secluded beach, this isn't for you. Lots of small bars on the beach serving drinks and hookah. Bean bags and lounge chairs dot the beach. Nice place to spend an afternoon or early evening. "
pjhaake,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",May 2016,"Quite strong waves and good fun for a quick swim but definitely not relaxing. After hearing some negative reviews, was pleasantly surprised that the beach was clean and free of litter, but also free of jellyfish, rocks/coral, etc. that can make ocean swimming unpleasant. Really enjoyed the beach!"
Skha18,"London, UK",May 2016,"We ventured down the road to Seminyak beach today and it was lovely. We got there via Ku De Ta (you can park up on the side of the road and walk through) and there were plenty of sun loungers available to rent, people who own them were more than happy to move them into the sun for us. You do have lots of people strolling the beach to sell bits and pieces but they will leave you alone after a smile and a no thank you. Lots of surfing going on but not much swimming due to the big waves. I only went in up to my waist before the tide felt too strong and the waves were crashing around me and didn't feel comfortable going out any further. Lovely clean beach, very friendly people just a shame we couldn't go for a proper swim in the sea but there are plenty more beaches to choose from for that in Bali!"
Mitu J,"Mandsaur, India",Jan 2016,Evenings are eventful on the beach. U have live music drinks and awesome sunset view. U can stay on the beach for hours and hours. but if You are a vegetarian then food is the problem.
Isabelle M,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2016,"Sitting on the bean bag enjoying my bintang beer at night. I took a blur bird taxi from kerobokan about 2km away from my villa to the beach side, there is a minimum charges for 30000 rupiah. Enjoying the music and sea wave. "
BrigLife,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"Lots of people, i would shy from the famous beaches if possible.Also, many retailers pushing souvenir sales"
BobNthQldAustralia,Nth Qld Australia,Mar 2016,"I love the beach there were good waves and the water was warm, there was NO undertow so it was safe. The hotel, (Harris) had deck chairs and umbrellas which was good and they provided a towel."
Simon W,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"This is the second night we enjoyed a chilled out dinner on the beach, we've been heading down around 4:30-5ish, kids have time for some fun then dinner on the beach "
didot,sydney,May 2016,"We went there on Sunday afternoon and could not bear to stay longer than 5 minutes. It was hectic, loud, hot, uncomfortable and just awful. However today  (wednesday) we walked along the beach from Kuta and landed back there. It was just great to have an ice cold beer, fewer people, reclining chairs, hasty pedicure and beautiful sunset."
Vadim K,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"The beach is overall clean in April, the sea is a great fun to swim in due to the crazy waves. Unfortunately, the whole beach is flooded by local people trying to sell whatever they can sell to you..."
Jason C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"By far this is one of the good spot at Bali to hang out around the beach. However the wave could be strong some time, that's why you should put attention on how strong the current at that day..."
Keith M,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2016,This beach is over 10km long and has sunbeds and small popup bars all along the waterside - the sea and waves are fantastic [watch out for cross swells and surfers] - lots of restaurants to choose from and most have live music on the beach at night - a night to remember 
Matt W,"Hobart, Tasmania, Australia",Jul 2015,"Less in your face and not so many all night partiers.. Has all the goods: great food, shops, bars and the beach is OK with a reasonable beginners surf break.. Just watch for spontaneous rips.. Cheaper accommodation in the back blocks with easy walking to beach."
Oliver,"Wilton Manors, FL",Apr 2016,"Honestly do not even bother going there! I was appalled when I saw how nasty this beach is. I mean Bali does not have nice beaches at all unless you are a surfer but this one is one of the worst. It just looks like you are at Brighton beach , NYC. The water is black, the sand is black with litter everywhere, the lounge chairs are 100 years old and vendors haggle you for a pedicure or a sarong every 5 minute! I had to leave to go to Kuta beach which is also disgusting. Bali is definitely NOT the place to go if you want turquoise water and white sand beaches! "
Jodie C,"Bundaberg, Australia",Apr 2016,"Kuta Beach much nicer then the one at Seminyak, but much busier. Seminyak is just the beach, where as Kuta has all of the locals set up offering massages, hair braiding, hire a few chairs with some alcohol and watch the sun set.. So if you want to avoid any of that then Seminyak doesn't have any of that."
Glenn H,World,Apr 2016,"Living on the east coast of Australia, you don't get many chances to watch the sunset over the ocean, and the changing colours that it causes. It's always great to watch..."
krchung12,"Baker City, OR",Apr 2016,"Stayed 5-7 minute walk from Seminyak beach. Pop in headphones or pretend your asleep to avoid hawkers selling you stuff. Got a nice henna tattoo done there, though :)Good swimming waves and my hubby tried out surfing and had a good time-although try to shop around as my husband felt the surf instructor he had didn't give sufficient attention for the price. Don't accept a beach chair for more than 50,000 IDR for two people the whole day, so make sure to negotiate and don't be afraid to pass up a place or two, cuz most likely the first place you passed up may welcome you back at the price you initially wanted :)All around I think it's a nice beach with a nice sunset and decent vibes. P.S. Try out Sand beach bar & restaurant at night on the beach--decently priced with good live music and is one of the more attentive, service-oriented staff/waiters/waitresses than the other spots nearby. "
TravelTaoSG,Singapore,Mar 2016,"Came here twice on 2 occasion, You can find bars, restaurants near by. Suntan on the beach, learn surfing, play in the sea, take a walk. At night, usually many bars/restaurants will bring out bean bags on the beach and have live music and its a sight to hear and see.For surfing, its a very good place for beginners. Price per person for 1h lesson and 1h free surfing $100,000 - $150,000"
Claire N,"Scarborough, Australia",Apr 2016,"We still love a beer on the beach, we always sit at Aussies bar it's just fun.  We do our souvenir shopping for the kids while we have a beer, massage and buy our fruit.You have to be prepared to be swarmed by the hawkers and be able to get rid of those you don't want to buy from- my method is be really nice and have fun with them but be up front and let them know right away that you're not interested and if you tell them you are then you should buy it from them and not waste their time arguing over 50 cents.  We get the cheapest prices on the beach and the fruit is always fresh and fabulous. It's important to remember this is whats done on the beaches in Bali, you can't be rude to these guys this is just what they do.Its a fun place to meet other travelers and have a chat, share experiences and make plans.Always worth a sit down for a icey cold drink . :-)"
Travellers057,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"Joined a large number of locals, ex pats and visitors walking along the clean beach (sadly  it has to be cleaned up early morning in the morning because of the significant sea pollution)every morning, especially good at low  tide. The growth of beachside bars that offer cocktails, cold Beer (restaurant prices) and local wines inthe afternoon is a good spot to watch the sunset"
Kathryn D,Australia,Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach was nice enough. I have been to much better beaches in the past.It was clean and not to many locals trying to sell you things. There were heaps of restaurants and bars. Plenty of lounges to hire. It was a pretty calm day when we went but many people were having a go at eater sports anyway. The water is warm but not very clear. Still great to cool off, after being in the hot sun all day. "
skyline1088,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Very nice beach where you can walk all the way out when the tide is low. Good choice of restaurants along the beach front too with their own entertainment music choices. Sunset is spectacular there. Definitely worth a trip!
Pranaya,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2016,The beach is good and get populated . There are many beach side shacks there to chose from and the seating options are vibrant . Very safe 
John C,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,Nice day out on the beach. Clean with plenty of sun beds just opposite Kudeta Restaurant.Was unpatrolled at the time we went so you need to becarful not to go too far out into big surf.Good for surfing.
sandeep b,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Sep 2015,"Great stay in seminayak and the beach is really beautiful. It was very close to where we stayed. Also, there are lot of clubs around where you can just sit chill and enjoy the sunset."
Jeffrey G,"Carlsbad, CA",Apr 2016,"Very nice clean beach, good waves, water looks clean.Waves can get fairly big 6' plus when we were there one of the days in April.Probably better to stay out when they get large, but otherwise a good swimming beach."
sfit4391,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"worth taking a wander down to the beach for relaxing drinks while watching the sunset,do a bit of shopping for watches,sunglasses,sarongs and jewellery as the beach vendors are around and also a few of the bars have music as well"
Lulufluff,"Bunbury, Australia",Apr 2016,"We went at night time and the beach didn't seem to have rubbish. We missed the sunset but that's okay as we enjoyed our night visit. There are restaurants that set up bean bags on the beach so it has a nice atmosphere. We were only approached once to buy things but we were polite and said no, and the man just moves on. "
sharbiiiie,45 contributions,Apr 2016,Seminyak beach seems to be a peaceful spot that you are less likely to get hassled on. It can get busy around sunset as people are out for walks on the beach and there was quite often a game of soccer
LittleLatte,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2016,"Compared to Kuta Beach which you might be strolling with huge amount of tourists, Seminyak beach is so much better and cleaner. There are restaurants along the beach. "
Alan C,"Bendigo, Australia",Apr 2016,Lots of people around but does have a very nice sunset. A lot of restaurants or party cafe by the beach so access to the beach can be not so straight forward. We happened to be having dinner at Potato Head Beach Resort.
Steve D,2 contributions,Apr 2016,This is a great beach to visit at night. The sound of the ocean creates serenity. Definitely check it out.
konrad s,"Cootamundra, Australia",Apr 2016,Somewhat dirty and constantly hassled by Hawkers.I  would have liked to have seen the  sunset but weather precluded this. I doubt you would be left alone to enjoy the experience.
mukesh_shukla_pune,Pune,Apr 2016,Nice clean beach. Not very crowded and was nice to go for the pleasant sunsets. Quite a few warnings around if you want some food or beers.  
delboy99,cornwall,Apr 2016,Seminyak Beach is a very large stretch of light brown volcanic sand .. The sea here is quite shallow so you can walk out quite far ... It does have some large waves rolling in which are ideal for surfing & body boarding .. Plenty of bars & restaurants to sit & watch the world go by ..
Crystal T,61 contributions,Apr 2016,"Loved this beach, so much to do.Endless subbed options that will bring you food and ice cold drinks, ice cream.Board hire or learn to surf.Swimming flags to keep you safe.Waves can get quite big and undertow very strong as well."
Wilson T,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"doing a bit of eating, reading and tanning then returned in the evening for a few drinks on the beach under lit up umbrellas. Not only a great place for a surf and a swim, but head down and grab a beanbag, a cocktail and watch the sunset with some great music "
Kathryn21121963,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,Get down early to enjoy a cocktail whilst watching the sunset. There are a few bars where bands play live music. Not too many hawkers either. 
Kirsten J,"Dublin, Ireland",Apr 2016,"I have been to much nicer beaches than this in Bali. It's not very clean, we didn't walk too far so it may be slightly nicer in other places - but certainly the part we were on wasn't nice at all. It's not very clean and smells like drains "
Chris D,"Bay of Plenty Region, New Zealand",Apr 2016,"any beach in the pacific is nicier  dirty and ill kept . the beach at kuta is much tidier  and  big seas, however very crowded, with lots of people trying to sell you things.  darker sandy beaches at seminak  but not that flash"
estoy,"Cagayan de Oro, Philippines",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach is a long stretch of shoreline of fine black sand. It is not crowded whether one will go there in the morning or afternoon. We went swimming in the morning & the waves is not that intense. A lot of people are jogging, walking & some are even doing yoga on the beach. In the afternoon we strolled  the beach to watch the sunset. It is so nice to see the kaleidoscope of color, the sky merging with the ocean as the shore reflects the colors of the sunset when the water rushes back to the sea...a respite from the crowd of tourists in Bali."
Nic Pat,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,"Beautiful, HOT, clean beach that stretches far in both directions. You can see the aeroplanes take off from the Airport to the left.Excellent place to relax under a beach umbrella (hired for $5). Ice cold drinks only a hand signal away. Loved it!!! "
Britneyooo,"Queensland, Australia",Jan 2016,"Dont expect nice beaches in this part of Bali. There are people pestering you. You can hire boards, and there are chairs usually to sit on (might have to pay for them). If you do want nice beaches, head to Finn's Beach Club or Uluwatu. Both are beautiful.  Finn's is much more commercialised than Uluwatu. It has a restaurant and day beds and trendy, hip music playing, a bar... and is fully set up. You have to pay to get down there (you go down on a little cart, sort of scary).  The food is expensive. Uluwatu on the other hand is for surfy people uninterested in all that stuff. To get to the beach you walk down stairs on a cliff (not scary, totally safe). There are traditional Indonesian cafes sticking out of the cliff with really yummy food and an AMAZING view. Plus, you don't have to pay to use the beach. I much prefer Uluwatu, but that's just me. "
coverallclothing,"Gisborne, Australia",Apr 2016,"What a great experience! Go for the sunset, pull up a bean bag, relax & enjoy the music! At each little place the music is great & food incredible value. It's an experience not to be missed if visiting Bali. Very casual & you're sure to find some music to suit your taste. Service great at all of them & the best place to have fun with friends. We will do this every time we go to Bali, highly recommended!"
LSJ,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Seminyak is one of the beach that you would like to visit if you prefer a quiet place to admire the waves. It has alot of restaurants along the beach with beanbags for your relaxation. Live Bands are there to provide the music with the waves. It was a good place to relax and watch the sunset. Definitely a place to visit if you seek a different feeling compared to Kuta beach.
TerjeHoegberg,"Oslo, Norway",Aug 2015,"Nice beach, less beach vendors, less surfers and less tourist than the more famous Kuta beach. Good alternative for a lazy day at beach or enjoying the sunset."
Kristine B,"Kingston, Jamaica",Apr 2016,"My friend and I wandered down to the beach after a nice salad lunch. The beach was nice but a bit disappointing, mainly because there is no accommodation made for people like us who are not staying at a waterfront hotel to relax on a lounge chair. Basically, we walked the beach and had to sit on our slippers when we wanted to rest for a bit. Still, there were no vendors harassing us on the beach, which can be a problem at beaches the world over. Also, the views were really nice. We happened to be there during low tide so we actually walked quite far out into the ocean while we were still on dry land. The surf was rough so we didn't swim but the water felt great as we stood in it up to our knees. Will I go back? No, I think I'll enjoy the pool at my hotel instead. The beach wasn't great enough to warrant another visit, especially since we're not surfers - there were a few surfers in the water but not being a surfer myself, I can't give any feedback on that aspect of things. However, I'm happy I can at least say that I checked it out."
Mikhael,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Aug 2015,"Was a good beach, didn't notice the countless of hawker selling stuff every few meters and calling you out every few second."
Bridget M,Melbourne,Mar 2016,I would probably rate this as good but TA doesn't have that rating so...it's not so bad but I'm spoilt with the white sand and clean beaches of Australia.This is a mixture of black volcanic and white sand beach so gives the impression of not being as clean as it could be but the beach is very long and very wide and friendly enough for your kids to paddle in.
Jane J,26 contributions,Apr 2016,Staying in Seminyak this trip our hotel had regular shuttles to Seminyak Square and beach. I was surprised to see that it was quite cllean there and so revisited a number of times. Sunsets were lovely. 
Tania putri,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Apr 2016,The beach is nice. Very hot. Very crowded and noisy. A lot of beach club there so we can't really walk along the beach too far.
John O,85 contributions,Apr 2016,"Good surf for body surfing, plenty of little cafes for a cheap drink or lunch (nasi goreng for $ 3.50 au!)"
melbournetraveller24,Melbourne Australia,Jan 2016,"Each morning we walked on the beach at sunrise. It was so beautiful, watching the light change as the sun rose, and we had the beach to ourselves. Glorious! Sunsets on the beach were spectacular too."
Simon H,7 contributions,Apr 2016,"Great beach day and night.  Take a walk grab a drink and chat to the locals at one of the many beach bar set ups all the way to Kuta.  The restaurants and vendors at night are awesome.  Let the kids buy a night lantern and let it go over the beach for a great memory.  Very safe and a lot of fun,"
GCampbell67,"Livingston, UK",Apr 2016,"A very very large beautiful beach, there are busier bits or quiet bits, very peaceful with big slashing waves, great if your a surfer. Water is warm, just overall beautiful."
CandN07,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"I love this long beach for morning walks and lazing at the bean bag bars  to watch the sunset- truly magical. The kids love the beach for it's nighttime entertainment- hawkers selling glow toys, art work, massages, sarongs and the beautiful coloured candle lanterns that are released after sunset.What I dislike immensely is all the rubbish both washed up and left higher on the sand.On my 1/2 hour morning walk yesterday I passed copious plastic bags, 2 used disposable nappies, 2 tubes of toothpaste, plastic water bottles etc. It is not a prisptine beach, it has  streams of foul water running into it and although they do clean the beach in the mornings it is still polluted. I don't swim there and my kids, who swallow sea water like seals, are not allowed in either- pools are a safer option."
Mohammed A,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2016,"Don't just miss coming to Seminyak beach , a super lovely spot, would highly recommend to spend some quality good romantic time in here if you are here as a couple!! "
Ireneren,20 contributions,Mar 2016,"We have been travelling around Bali and had our last days near this beach. It was around Nuepi, Balanese New Year. A religious time where lots of ceremonies are held at the beach. This means a lot of polution, 1000s of palm leaf plates with cigarettes, flowers ect. all over. At the same time the beach it self didnt appeal to anything else but surfing, not swimming. But the beach was nice for walking and watching sun sets."
McDeal04,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2016,Had a nice time on the beach. Especially loved how they had restaurants/bars right on the beach with lots of comfortable lounge seating. We saw on big bean bag chairs while we watched the sunset and drank beers. They also had a great live band playing on the beach. The only downfall was the beach merchants. My advice would be to not buy or talk to any of them if you don't want anything. If you buy something from one they will all flock to you. Although it was nice to get a foot rub while watching the sunset :) 
Amerikki,"Shenzhen, China",Feb 2016,"A nice beach a little removed from the more crowded ones.  Loved all of the little ""bars"" in the area.  Though you need to pay to use the beach chairs, it was a lot of fun to sit and watch the waves crash while enjoying a cold one or two."
Bev S,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,"Am I missing something here? We are staying in the middle of Seminyak so a trip to the beach was a must do. Went to the Mosaic Beach club (which is quite okay) but very disappointed in the beach and can't recognise what I saw in some of the reviews! Hot, grey, coarse sand, ungroomed beach access points, strong tides (and I can swim well) and sewage outlets so a walk along the beach is an obstacle course. I like lots of things about Bali but give me Aussie beaches anytime, rather than Seminyak, although I will go back to enjoy the Sunset!"
Kalsum27,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,"my husband and I are choose to stay at Seminyak for our honeymoon in Bali. What can I say is, Seminyak is a perfect location for those who want to stay at moderate area. Easy to find a Halal food for the muslim but if you can't find the Halal restaurant, just asked the local people because most of the Bali's local people are friendly and helpful."

Rainindancers,214 contributions,Apr 2016,This area of Bali is nice although there are a lot of sewerage ports which enter the ocean via the middle of the beach. You walk the beach and you have to jump over the sewerage running into the water
aprilnyeo,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2016,It is less crowded and much cleaner than in Kuta.  Not many touting and it feels safer with securities in every single hotel along the beach.
Hungaryforlife,"Paris, France",Apr 2016,"Happy , smiling people , sellers dont hassle you too much . Enjoyed the loungers for The Courtyard Marriot hotel , in perfect position to watch hubby surfing . Beach and laneway behind clean and great little cafes .A real buzzy area late in the afternoon with music , live and dj and cold Bintang !"
tmbobSlough,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,Good beach and being in this area is quieter than Kuta beach. Was clean and good swimming. Lots of places along the beach front from upmarket restaurants and cheaper places and bars to eat and drink. Sunset here is popular with bars cafes putting out tables and chairs on the beach for the sundowner drinks session. 
Jacob15,"Wellington, New Zealand",May 2015,"Not quite as nice a section of the entire beach, as the Kuta section. There were quite a few rivers that water poured down at different times, seeming to bring pollution with them, from the streets above. Lot of kids were playing in those sections of flowing water. "
paula2427,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,"This beach is full of restaurants and beach clubs, really convenient for friends and young families. Clean and warm water."
sarahkennedy57,"Wollongong, Australia",Apr 2016,"It was my first time visiting this beach. After only visiting Kuta beach, Seminyak beach is just amazing!!!!! We arrived at 11am and it was so quiet. No where as busy as Kuta Beach. My daughter even got her hair done and nails painted. I found we weren't hassled as much as we have been at Kuta beach, The beach was very clean and pretty. We will definitely be back to Seminyak"
Jennie M,"Glasgow, UK",Apr 2016,"Beach is ok, however the breaks are so big you can't really go for a relaxing swim. Water Is quite shallow. Prepare for people trying to sell you things "
LMCNX,"Phoenix, AZ",Apr 2016,"Once that we got far enough away from the stream the beach itself was okay.  Did not like the vendors that overcharge for everything.  It took some time to figure out what you should pay to rent a beach chair, etc.  We enjoyed the beaches on the east coast more than the crowds at Seminyak."
Sanna S,"Tallinn, Estonia",Apr 2016,"Super places on the beach, to party, to enjoy, to eat or drink. Super big waves, nice to watch and walk."
seantzw,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,We went for a stroll along seminyak beach and it was fantastic. The sand was top notch and the views were spectacular. Well worth a visit! 
Alisa W,16 contributions,Apr 2016,The beach is dirty and cant believe  people would swim here. There is rubbish  everwhere and the sand is like dirt   
taylormcland,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"This the best beach i have seen, this beach very good to see the sunset and on the day time also nice to get sun."
Tim P,13 contributions,Apr 2016,"As Aussies we are spoilt with some of the best beaches in the world. Seminyak beach is nothing special, surf-able waves, but still just ok. I wouldn't return. It is similar to Kuta Beach, but without the great food and stalls. "
EatFunLove,Taiwan,Jun 2015,"If you can't swim, be stay somewhere close to where people do sunbathing. The sometimes waves can go very long distance within few second. Extra careful if you are with camera and phone."
Mai,9 contributions,May 2015,"When we went, it was from afternoon to night and saw the beautiful sunset.Not too crowded and definitely a must."
sandy75014,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2016,"I stayed in Seminyak at Dash Hotel and had a wonderful stay there. Seminyak is perfect if you want to party but the beach is not the best one of Bali if you are a swimmer. Besides, Seminyak as the vibe of little town on the beach like Dauville or St Tropez. This is very pleasant to stroll in small streets for shopping...very nice boutiques and good restaurant & coffee shop. The location is perfect if you are trendy, like party and can drive a motorbike to explore Bali"
AmbLee,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2016,"My friend was so excited to show me this beach, as he said it was so beautiful. As I arrived I was quite surprised as to how average this beach was. There was a large stretch of sand, some of which was black and there was quite a bit of litter flowing in the streams to and from the ocean. Anyone who doesn't notice the pollution at this beach needs to get their eyes checked and reconsider what a good beach looks like. The hawkers also made it somewhat unpleasant, and the entrance/exit is quite tricky to find if you're a first timer. We weren't allowed to walk through any hotels to the main road, so we left with blistered feet from the hot sand trying to find our way out. I would not visit this beach again in a rush. I've seen much better beaches in Bali."
dundeetours,"Hobart, Australia",Apr 2016,Such a great experience Can't be faulted even the vendors were nice when we said no thank youPs trip advisor we don't appreciate having to write 100 words or more just to submit & be helpful 
Sal E.M A,26 contributions,Apr 2016,"The first day we arrived to Bali our Friend took us to Seminyak beach, the lights and the atmospher were denomination of beauty, music was popping at each corner and it was a nice evening chill area.

JamieIrwin,"Gardenvale, Ballymoney",Apr 2016,"We had a lazy day early on Seminyak beach, doing a bit of eating, reading and tanning then returned in the evening for a few drinks on the beach under lit up umbrellas. This is what I pictured Bali being like. Absolute bliss.The pictures will illustrate better than my words ever could."
Sulacool,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"quite beach than kuta beach, good for relaxing and swimming, enjoying sunset with afternoon drink, good time in afternoon and got fantastic moments with couple, friends or family."
Nicoman,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"The water is warm, the waves are perfect for bogie boarding, the sand is black and it is never crowded. The sunsets are spectacular."
Almyhappy,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Nice stretch of beach with black sand.. Bring a long a matt or beach towel if you do not want to pay for the beach chair.
AnnieA86,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Apr 2016,"We really like Seminyak Beach. Saw that many persons has written in their reviews that beach is poorly cleaned, but we did not experience that at all. Very clean beach and many nice pool/drink bars along the beach as well. "
sbg62015,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Regulars to the seminyak area - we stayed at the Oberoi for our Wedding anniversary. Beach is great by bali standards - as always watch out for dogs and their outputs. Surfed 9 days in a row - gold.
Campsi1030,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2016,"We have been staying in Jimbarran but have visited Seminyak and Kuta. We have decided that if we return we would stay in Seminyak. Jimbarran is a little quiet and away from things and Kuta is, well, Kuta. Seminyak is the in between option. Good beach with more sand, large number of restaurants and less hawkers than Kuta while a bit more lively than Jimbarran."
Brendan T,292 contributions,Apr 2016,Not a really special beach. Its clean and has alot of beach bars. Not As much vendors As on kuta beach. But still there are Some.Beach beds cost around 100.000 if you dont bargain. You should at least Get them under 50.000 for a day. Good luck. 
Katie O,"Townsville, Australia",Mar 2016,"Lots of choice on the beach for live music dinner and drinks. Great value for money.Every evening whilst there we would wonder down for the beautiful sunset to top off our busy days. Lots of choice for meals . Italian, asian and western cuisine.  "
ActionAl,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2016,"Seminyak has got to be the busiest and most exciting beach resort destination in Asia! Although no longer a quiet little fishing village (which I expect some people lament) it now has something for everyone, all ages, and surprises everywhere to keep you entertained and on your toes!Highly recommend grabbing a bean bag on the beach at dusk and trying some of the local cocktails ;) Selfie stick not necessary!"
Anthony S,14 contributions,Apr 2016,"If you  are  in the area, watching the sunset at a good bar or restaurant is a must. Breath taking beauty. Beach is fairly clean and safe to swim at.  Some places about to hire surf and body boards. "
Dazhetho,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2016,"No shade, only drawback, unless you hire beach lounge and umbrella, beach hawkers weren't as frequent"
H2Odreamer,Australind- WA,Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach was OK fairly clean and not as crowded as Kuta, unfortunately  we found the hawkers on the whole to be pushy and quite rude on the day we visited which is always a disappointment in a destination known for its friendly and happy people, in fairness it is hard to make a positive comment on Balinese beaches in comparison to our beaches at home but overall was not blown away but at the same time not sorry we took the time to have a look."
Federico Q,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"The beach itself is really poor, sometimes quite dirty and smelly but there are lots of bars crating a nice atmosphere. The only problem is that bars are really close to each other and if sitting outside you can ear loud music from different bars "
Felix L,"Berlin, Germany",Mar 2016,"We went down there on our first night on Bali. The beach itself is fairly clean, considering the amount of people there. It's a nice beach, even with a decent surf break and if you like it a bit more busy with entertainment (bars, etc.) around you definitely a cool beach. Way too busy and loud for us though, so only 3 stars."
Piotr N,4 contributions,Mar 2016,"The place was covered with rubbish. Enough said i think. So much for a romantic walk if you are tripping over empty bottles. OK it must be the tourists, but it's up to the authorities to tidy up. There are a lot of bars along, nothing special. If you sit on the beach prepare to be nagged every 2min by somebody selling selfie sticks or some dubious paintings. Did not meet the expectation one bit."
sebastio Achmad,242 contributions,Apr 2016,Very nice place to hang out. You can see the sunset here. Around you can find many cafe and good restaurants. So many activities doing by tourists here. 
Ferida H,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2016,"We stayed at Pondok Sara Villas only a 5 minute walk to the beach.The sunsets were fabulous,.All the restaurants had there own bands and bean bags to relax by the beach.. Also only about a 10 minute drive to Kuta. There were lots of small and large eateries, Also if you like corn on the cob they barbeque it on the beach. Really nice and fresh. Would definitely go there again."
Preston S,"Whistler, Canada",Apr 2016,Beautiful sandy beach. Constantly changing surf. Roaring all day. Red flags are posted when the riptide is too dangerous to swim. Surfers were rocking the waves. Constant barrage of hawkers. 
178kris,"Noosa, Australia",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach is agreat place to chill out watch the sunset have a massage ,meet the locals and enjoy the beach."
AkhilBiju,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2016,Not as crowded as some other beaches. Very picturesque and calm.we experienced a gorgeous sunset there.
Vithia P,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",May 2015,Clean and beautiful beach. Lesser people compared to Kuta beach. There are few motorized activities along the beach.
Bri B,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2016,We sat and relaxed at Opy's Beach Bar and were waited on hand and foot. Wel also dined at one of the beach restaurants and the views are just amazing. 
George K,"Athens, Greece",Mar 2016,A nice beach with even better restaurants and bars. Best time to visit is around sunset so you can enjoy a swim and a drink and relaxation time at one of the beach bars. Fine music everywhere
Sharkdive1,"Zurich, Switzerland",Mar 2016,"Overall very nice. There are not too many sunbeds in general, so be aware of this. Best is you use a Beach Club (but also there, be aware that you need to be early to get a sunbed)"
kmartyn2016,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"This beach can be a little busy, its not like our beaches in aussie, the sand is black as it is volcanic, overall the beach is good, the sunsets are amazing, great for a day relaxing on the sun lounges and watching the sunsets."
Brendan,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,Went once did not go back again just dirty and off putting disappointing there was nothing happening down there would not go back
Ben G,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Not really ideal for a swim etc as it seems like there is a lot of rubbish on this side of the island.
melbentley1981,"Ipswich, Australia",Mar 2016,"Beautiful sunsets, great restaurants and entertainment on the beach. A little dirty but it's ok to spend the day relaxing on one of the beach chairs. "
Scott M,"Beaumaris, Australia",Mar 2016,"This only our 3rd visit to Bali but after trying a few different spots along the stretch of beach from Ku de Ta in Seminyak to Marriot at Legian in our view the beach directly in front of Chez Gado Gado is our favorite. Water is clear, surf is good for beginners to intermediate, lounge chair hire for a pair is usually $50k per hour and surfboard hire the same.The old guy selling Bintang, water and soft drinks will run a tab, the ice cream vendor calls past regularly and if you need cheap eats you have a good selection on the beach nearby or alternatively can go more upmarket with Gado Gado.Contrastingly the Seminyak end near Ku de Ta has poor surf, the water is murky and contains quite a bit of rubbish and the beach vendors charge more saying... 'it is Seminyak'. If you enjoy the beach and swimming/surfing and have teenagers the Gado Gado area is the spot for you."
andrewwACID2000,14 contributions,Feb 2016,Restaurants are world class around Seminyak .. Walking is a little difficult as is always in Indonesia on the streets.. The Beach is like most beautiful beaches especially at sunset...  
Riona A,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2015,This beach is stunning. Soft sea sand..beautiful sunsets..and warm water. I enjoyed the afternoon here
Sam,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"The beach was very clean ocean beautiful, nice sun loungers and a stroll over to Ku Du Ta for a great lunch and glass of wine"
Rosa S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"It is one of very busy beach in Bali with lots of pedlars and surfers. Lots of places to eat and drink and play or just for watching the sunset. There are sun loungers to hire with big umbrellas. For sure, much more relaxing, peaceful and cleaner compare to Kuta beach."
FHTworldwide,"Dub√°i, Emiratos √Årabes Unidos",Apr 2016,"Between the most popular beaches in Bali, this one is the best one, not so smelly and crowded like kuta and nice for walking during sunset. "
Shirley Wu,"Shanghai, China",Mar 2016,We went there in one morning and it was quite. not too many people but some were jsut enjoying the sunshine. the beach itself is more clean then i expected. also you can see some rocks around the sea. we had walks on the beach and we also saw a local man was fishing. ans some were surfing. so i liked this quite morning at Seminyak beach. much better thatn Double six beach at my point of view.
Kerrymaid_Orlaith,Kerry,Mar 2016,Gorgeous sunset on bean bags at beach bars. .. lovely lighting and chilled music. Worth a trip down in the evening for nice pics. Family friendly also with vendors selling nick nacs.
daphne928,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"Love going to seminyak beach to watch the sunset and have a few drinks listening to chill out music. After 4 in the afternoon all the beach bars have set up their bean bags and fairy lights, turned up their music and local and tourists wander down and chill out."
Rebecca_andAmir,"London, UK",Feb 2016,A beautiful beach with the best view of the Balinese sunset.  Enjoy a cocktail as you watch the sun go down.
Indra P,Jakarta,Mar 2016,"Seminyak, like its brother Kuta, allowed us to see the beautiful sunset, laid back cafes, flying kites, and (not fully) good music. I recommend La Plancha as your best place to enjoy Seminyak. As i didn't prefer too dynamic clubs such as Double Six and Cocoon."
TIersHasie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Cleaner than Kuta beach and less touts around the place.Heaps of waterfront restaurant and bars with live music and tables, bean bags, shade options on the beach to see the beautiful Seminyak sunset.Good nightlife in a more upmarket environment compared to the beaches of Legian and Kuta."
Venki S,Singapore,Mar 2016,We had a great sunset view from Seminyak Beach during our visit in March 2016. Beach was clean and pleasant
Batyah_12,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",Mar 2016,The atmosphere on this outstretched beach is magical! You can have a different sunset painting on the same canvass every night. The restaurants mostly have live bands & specials on cocktails every night. During the day daybeds are available at a nominal (always negotiated!) rate
Mr. Jazz,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2016,this spot is nice & clean. also it is public and there are many activities in this spot. also the waves are not that much strong.
Timlanzon,Perth,Mar 2016,"Seminyak beach, although completely hounded by people trying to sell you items is a great place to watch the sunset. Pick any one of the amazing beach restaurants to sit it, get a beer and watch the sun go down"
Aussiejack1,"Vancouver, Canada",Mar 2016,"The beach at Seminyak has changed a lot over the last 15 years, as expected. What I did not expect this time around was the huge increase in the volume of garbage on the beach. It was very dissapointing to see so much garbage washing up on the shoreline. It was hard to enjoy a stroll along the beach while dodgeing so much garbage. So sad to see and nobody really seems to care."
Docjari18,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2016,Step out from the Oberoi Bali property and you are onto Seminyak Beach as it is kissing with the it.Beautiful beach with crystal clear water.Swim in your own privacy as not crowded..
woojin2016,"Beverly Hills, CA",Aug 2015,The most smoothest beach sand in Bali. And their sand is dark so that it reflects all light when sun goes down. Must go place!!
linlin668,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,Stayed at FuramaXclusive Ocean Beach hotel. Seminyak Beach just a few footsteps away from the hotel. Beautiful and relaxing beach. Preferred Seminyak to Kuta Beach.
PKKC,"London, UK",Mar 2016,Nice sandy beach with lounges and umbrellas for hire.  A number of beach clubs with restaurants and bars to watch the sunset.  Not sure about the drains flowing down the beach to the ocean through!!
Ian M,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2016,"The beach is a short walk from Seminkak Square and shopping district. There are umbrellas and lounges to hire and a number of hawkers coming around offering their wares for sale. There are a restaurants and coffee shops near by and a wash down arear to wash of the sand, quite beach good for the little ones.  "
philandcathy,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2016,Because it is actually the ocean the rips are strong and the waves are fearsome. I took my little boy in and left shortly after getting smashed a couple of times.  Nice to look at but be aware.
G-HARP-CRAWLEY,Crawley,Mar 2016,"Seminyak Beach is OUTSTANDING...!! Lots of great beach bars to watch the sunset, a number of them even have live music. An ideal place to relax and watch the sun go down. During the day, you can surf and swim - Just one tip - The sand gets REALLY hot... Make sure you take some flip flops..!! (Thongs for your Aussies out there!). We walked down the beach from Seminyak - Legian - Kuta (About a 35 minute walk). It is in fact the same coast line, but called different resorts. The beach seems to get more dirty as you go along. (More rubbish in the sea and on the sand)."
alvie_ch,127 contributions,Jan 2016,"Another nice beach in Bali. Not as crowd as Kuta, yet not quiet as Petitenget. I prefer this place than Kuta since it offers something ""different"". Enjoy morning or night falls here and feel the atmosphere."
Henri C,"Los Angeles, CA",Mar 2016,"From morning till sunset and beyond, there is always something going on! Great private beach clubs, or just with a towel and sunscreen, there is no bad way to go!"
Debra1967,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"We spent approx 4 hours on deck chairs under an umbrella and for first hour we had every beach seller approach us trying to sell sunglasses, handbags, jewellry, viagra, valium and offers to give massages, manicures hair braided you want something I am sure they had it or could get it for you, after they finished with us and noticed another new face trying to sit and enjoy a day at the beach we had a nice cold drink brought to us by owners of the beach bar and sat back and enjoyed the sights it was wonderful, a great way to spend a few hours,  oh and it only cost $5.00 aust dollars to sit on their chairs!!"
Tanya M,"Barcelona, Spain",Mar 2016,"This stretch of beach could be beautiful but it's not. I went back today when it was just off high tide to see if it was any better than when we were there at low tide. But no luck, it is still dirty and polluted. What a shame. The sand when wet resembles mud and sticks like paste to everything (not like most sand, which sticks but will brush off). I know the locals have to make a living but there are so many people trying to sell you things, which is fine when walking through but I imagine it could get a little annoying if you decided to sit in the beach.I saw and heard many people complaining of skin rashes and sores after the beach and swimming in the ocean.Hopefully Bali can get a plan together to reduce the water and beach pollution and increase recycling or people will stop coming and that would be a real shame. It is a beautiful long stretch of beach which needs to be cleaned up."
TheLaskers,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,Seminyak Beach is nice and clean great cabanas you must pay nice place to relax with a book .Its close to walk to if you staying in Seminyak or a quick taxi ride not expensive plenty of hotels on waters edge to have something to drink or eat.
Renee C,11 contributions,Mar 2016,"Lovely beach to visit, great sunsets. Love the bands and bean bags. Excellent service at Capil Beach Bar"
cynsync21,12 contributions,Mar 2016,"Not to far away from bustling Kuta, Seminyak is a perfect place to escape from noises. There are a lot of pretty small shops along the streets, polite people, and the weather is not as hot as Kuta. The beach is cleaner compared to Kuta Beach, strong winds and soft sands. There are a lot of stray dogs running around (loving it!). Sunset view is amazing. Very peaceful and calming, at night a lot of bars and live music around.Many eateries but a bit hard to find Indonesian restaurants here."
Paramasasti,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"If you park at pura near kayu aya, you'll find the beach next to you. Its an easy beach with not to strong wave. Very bright and no shade. You can swim or just lay on the beach waiting for sunkissed skin"
iannankervis,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Even though we went around 9pm the atmosphere was great with music and service. We would definitely come back and spend much more time having a look around.
mankur,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2016,"Been to beaches all over Bali, but this had some amazing waves to surf, and a lot of good energy on this beach"
Travelwithme,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"Its less crowded here and the beach is beautiful. Lots of small and large eateries, including spanish tapas and drinks.Make sure you bring lots of water, hat and lotion."
SJW2,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"This is not a tropical white sands beach and its where tourists and locals go to see the sunset, which were amazing! Very big and very busy "
graemephillips2016,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"My wife and I really enjoy Seminyak Beach. We surf using surfboards, body boards, the property of The Legian Bali Hotel where we stay, and plain surfing and swimming.  When the tide goes out the beach is fantastic for long walks on firmer sand. The ladies who sell beads and sarongs to keep their families housed and fed are all pleasant and beautifully mannered. Kikki, Rosy and Sally also provide massages on the beach, manicures, pedicures to a high standard which we take advantage of to add to the attraction of the beach. They treat us so well we return to the magnificent  The Legian Hotel Bali as often as we can. The really good fun is once every stay I get into a bartering discussion buying goods from them. At the conclusion I pay the agreed price and give them back the goods and tell them to sell them to someone else. Their well being is much more important to my wife and I than the goods or the money. They are lovely ladies in happy marriages with a strong sense of family. They add value to the beach in the area that is accessed by the public whether they are visiting the beach or staying at a hotel along the beach. I never cease to be amazed at how these ladies and their children speak perfect English and are so inquisitive about our 5 children, their spouses and our 13 grandchildren. It all adds to the beach that is regularly cleaned and well policed. We will return soon."
Harrisp6,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,The beach is wide and reasonably clean the sunsets are fantastic. You can walk several kms to centro shops or just wander but do it early before too hot..
RimaDuffy,"Yorkshire, UK",Jan 2016,"not that clean but not bad also, sunset here looks really great. everybody can come to this place..."
kpBunbury,"Bunbury, Australia",Mar 2016,This is a lovely beach with plenty of access to eateries and local bars. When we were here yesterday there was some excellent surf breaks. Lower key than Kuta but still approaching a highly commercial area. 
S M L S,111 contributions,Mar 2016,"This beach could be really beautiful and fine to sunbathing at. But it is quite dirty, both from people on the beach who do not have the sense to collect their rubbish and use the bins and from garbage washed up on the beach. Dogs are running around. But there are also many hotels with nice restaurants who are located at the beach. Wonderful view out towards the Indian Ocean."
adelahm2677,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,Beautiful place and was there to see the sunset. It was beautiful! Beach was quite empty which is good :)
ToniaH3,147 contributions,Mar 2016,"Nice for relaxing ,is better to get a spot near restaurant as you can then order and stay on beach.. Beach is very clean.üå¥"
Tatiana1704,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"nice beach, lots of people and dogs walking. part of the beach had rubbish littered along it which was a shame. the water was very warm."
Marshalltfinch,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,"Just like most beaches on the western side of Bali, you can find a nice spot and a drink to watch the sunset. Worth heading down and chatting to the local guys down there. "
UliA3,"Beijing, China",Sep 2015,Loved the sunset overlooking the waters with a drink from one of the beach bars. Worth seeing for sure!
Jennifer T,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Feb 2016,"Very, very disappointing.  Did not dare go into the water because of visible pollution everywhere.  I even saw dead fishing floating about.  The sand is a very dirty colour and  hard to get off to clean your feet."
Tiago De Matos P,"Lisbon, Portugal",Mar 2016,The seminyak beach is long and you have good areas and bad areas. If you go from Kudeta (bar) to the left you can find the better part of the beach clean and you can rent shadow and Sun lounger very cheap .. If you go the opposite way you will find many dirty spots. 
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Mar 2016,"Whether you're looking for water sports, to read a book, go for a swim or walk, Seminyak beach is the place to be.Lovely white beach stretching on for miles with a warm blue sea to cool off in. Loads of places rent sun beds with parasols cheaply and the edge is lined with many good bars and restaurants.You do get approached quite a lot by the beach sellers but they are friendly and only trying to earn a living.A great place to spend long, sunny and relaxing days."
Tallulah T,45 contributions,Mar 2016,"Beautiful sunsets at this beach, as most are in Bali. Relaxed vibe and you don't get hassled constantly by sellers. Enjoy a Bintang on the sun bed and go for a dip."
Suzie O,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,Seminyak has become the upmarket area of Bali ... The beach is lovely and the sunsets are amazing. Take a stroll and stop at The W for a couple of drinks and a swim in the pool.
Ladyintheusa,"Javea, Spain",Feb 2016,Most of the hotels here back onto the beach but from what we saw no one used the beach. There are alleyways onto the beach from the main routes from the town. The town is very busy with dozens of scooters which go down to the beach. 
domjoha,"Stuttgart, Germany",Mar 2016,"Really nice clean beach which is good to start surfing. It is very touristic there, with lots of bars and little surfershops to get a surfboard or surf lesson at the beach. We got two sun lounger for 150 a day. A surfboard is around 50 per hour."
Tam13,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Mar 2016,"The water is warm, the sunset beautiful / the sand covered in rubbish. Don't let your kids go barefoot, I stood on a chicken bone and cut my foot.Otherwise nice. "
Work4Good,"Whangarei, New Zealand",Feb 2016,A quiet morning walk followed by a quick surf. What a delightful experience on his very clean beach where vendors are respectful of tourists
Ianvt2013,"Edgemead, South Africa",Feb 2016,"Seminyak Beach is a must when in Bali. This beach must be unique, because in the afternoon it transforms into a beanbag beach. Yes, all the restaurant/bars on Seminyak Beach put out beanbags and tables facing the sunset. They also have local bands performing until the sun has set. Don't miss this spectacular sight!"
Emily-Paige,"Sun Peaks, Canada",Mar 2016,Great beach! Not super busy but yet it is still one of the lovely beaches here in Bali! Every time I have been to Bali I have stayed in Seminyak!
Magnusigbg,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Mar 2016,"Went down to the beach late afternoon, not much people there then, only a few surfers. I don't surf, but probably great waves. They seemed to enjoy. Walked along the beach and just having a great time. Real beautiful view over the open sea. Great place to just walk around or surf or just sun bath. Suits every one. "
ellirainbow,"Willaston, Australia",Mar 2016,Be sure to head to one of the beach bars Pull up a beanbag have a Bintang and watch the sunset After sunset feel the ambience and romance of the gorgeous hues of lanterns that adorn the properties Truly beautiful experience 
Jeannie B,"McCrae, Victoria, Australia",Feb 2016,Unfortunately alot of rubbish gets washed up with the tide. Its a constant battle for the ladies collecting the flotsam.  You can get a good cheap massage however!
Urvi G,"Panvel, India",May 2015,The beach is just amazing. The blue water and orange skies can be watched during evening just sitting back alone. The water is clear and the beach too is very clean. Its a happening beach but u can still enjoy peace here. 
Nieadelia,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"Yes nice beach, clean not garbage everywhere, easy to chill. Love to see sunset here and the wave cool, you can play either."
sarah_ndc,Singapore,Mar 2016,Seminyak beach is great to just take an evening walk to enjoy the sunset and then check out the bars and restaurants that line the coast.
Askthegoodman,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"I first went to Seminyak Beach last year when my wife and I attended a wedding. I could only shoot from the hotel grounds because of lack of time. This time I did some internet research to find out more about this beach, which is just slightly north of Legian and Kuta. I discovered beautiful shots of people having a grand time under giant umbrellas while lying down on giant beanbags. I was determined to shoot the sunset there. As I was staying at The Magani Hotel in Legian and was carrying a heavy camera bag, I took a taxi to Seminyak Beach. The driver dropped me off near Double 6 Seminyak Hotel. From there I just walked to the beach. Instead of writing about what I saw, just take a look at some of the images I shot. You'd wish you were there."
coolchiki,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"I think this beach ia better than kuta beach (if you are staying near the city). You can rent chairs for IDR30k-IDR50k. But you cannot have a relaxing sunbath because there are alot of people offering stuff to you. Manicure, pedicure, tattoo, etc. "
Loveatfoodsight,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2016,This beach is beautiful with a no of restaurants and beach side bars. You can rent your loungers for a pretty cheap price and enjoy the waves and the breeze. This beach is excellent for surfers but not that great for swimming bcoz of the strong currents. Perfect place to enjoy the sunset as well.
Daniel T,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"Great place for a Bali sunset. There are some nice places for that along the stretch, but best spot is around the Italian restaurant la luciolla."
Ming Yu,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,Soft find sandy beach with great view of sunset.   Soccer and surfing players paradise. U can have some drinks and finger food at e seaside bars sitting in bean bags.
Bj L,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,The beach has pay for chairs and its a long beach and there are no waves here. Its an ok beach but I've seen many better in Australia and other places.
Diviva,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"Compared to Kuta Beach, Seminyak Beach is alot more tranquil and peaceful. Less crowded and certainly lesser touts. The beach here is perfect to watch sunset on a clear day"
ElleCaseyauthor,"Sommieres, France",Mar 2016,"Husband and I took a stroll on this beach today. The water was warm enough to be considered bath water. The waves were incredible. If I were surfer I would have been stoked, dude. Totally stoked. We also stopped off at Ku De Ta for a slushy (we both got watermelon, but I had to add simple syrup to mine because it was toooo sour). We watched two senior citizens battle the current, only up to their knees in the water. I seriously feared for their lives as I watched them almost get sucked out with the current. I'm pretty sure this isn't a place for swimming on account of those currents and those monster waves, but it sure is pretty. Worth a walk. The only downside is the depressing garbage that washes up with the waves ... plastic bags, bottles, yogurt cups (I had no idea so many peopled liked yogurt), and weird things I couldn't identify. I feel sorry for the fish around Bali."
Raelene B,"Maroochydore, Australia",Mar 2016,"Seminyak beach it's self is pretty average. We had just stayed at Sanur and Nusa Dua which has white sand beaches and clear blue water, we expected the same of Seminyak. This was absolutely not the case. The beach is littered with rubbish, has run off from the drains which makes the area around the outlets brown and brings in even more rubbish and the sand is black, not white!The only positives I can conclude are that the sunsets are amazing from Seminyak Beach and there are many hotels which offer day bed hire, but these are very expensive for Bali. The cheapest we found was IDR 500,000 per day bed (which you can use for food and drink) which can fit 4 people comfortably however others had 6ppl at the Potato Beach Club up to IDR 1,000,000 per person at the gorgeous W Retreat."
Jitske J,"Groningen, The Netherlands",Mar 2016,Beautiful beach. I didn't try swimming but I ran next to the beach it was great for doing that. You also have beautiful sunsets from here and in the evening the place gets bubbly and alive. Also many restaurants at the beach.
Ganesh P,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Mar 2016,Overall good beach..  have plenty of sitouts nearby..  Surfing boards were available for surfers..  beach is clean and people found relaxing and chilling out..
Meryl G,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,After spending some time walking along the beach during the day we returned to a restaurant for a casual dinner - sitting on bean bags - with great entertainment
Febryan I,14 contributions,Jan 2016,"Cool place to swim, to learn how to surf, or just spending your day looking at the waves. Not dirty also. I enjoyed the time when i was here"
jillsydneyaustralia,"Woolwich, Australia",Mar 2016,"Seminyak beach is really just ok, the hawkers will inundate you, I bought something just to stop them hounding me, but even more came to me after that! It's not always that clean."
romelg33,"Beirut, Lebanon",Feb 2016,if you want to spend some extra time out of your hotel in Seminyak then you can reach this beach easily either by a hotel shuttle or through a taxi that wont cost you much. along the beach there are many cafes and bars to chill in or you can just relax on the warm sand. if you have more time and want to see better beaches I suggest you see the Padang Padang Beach as well.
Rowstr,100 contributions,Apr 2015,"If I have to give some very useful advice, skip Seminyak beach and go straight to Legian or Kuta beach (10 minutes‚Äô walk). It basically looks the same, only difference is that the rental beds, drinks, food etc are half the price there. We found Legian beach best, since it was not crowded but also affordable."
Neelesh84,"Noida, India",Dec 2015,"Very Nice beach, you will see huge waves during high tide time and can take a dip in it too.. No Shacks or locker facility nearby so need to take care of your stuffs - though its pretty safe. Must visit for Surfers !!!"
Outgirl2,29 contributions,Mar 2016,"What more can you say, it's hot sandy and wet. Watch out for peddlers.....drive you nuts!! Constantly offering you knock of gear.  Apparently you can get fined for buying from them but I've not seen it happen "
A_Cats_World,"Lugano, Switzerland",Mar 2016,"Average beach , beautifully warm water and fun waves (be careful strong current) We paid 100K for 2 long chairs (50K each) for the full daymany restaurants and places to have a drink aroundnot very clean unfortunately Be aware that the long chairs need to be removed at 6PM when the restaurants open so deal your price accordingly ."
kmcconnell,Scot near London,Aug 2015,"This is a very busy beach with lots of pedlars and surfers, this is definitely a young persons place. Lots of places to eat and drink and play."
Felisma C,37 contributions,Feb 2016,The beach is average. Not too bad and yet not too beautiful. Just ok. Normal. But the wave is good for surfing. 
AprilApril,Gloucestershire,Mar 2016,"Watch out for the flagged area , as swimming there is too dangerous. The waves are big and great for surfing."
Dale W,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",Mar 2016,"As an avid health nut I jogged down to Seminyak beach at day-break. The beach was alive with people raking and collecting what looked to be an insurmountable amount of plastic articles.Apparently when the rains set-in, debris flows from neighbouring Java which adds to the problems Bali faces. I couldn't find a rubbish bin anywhere, except 150 meters away near a hotel opening... Obviously this is part of their problem."
rachaelh256,New Zealand,Jun 2015,Great beach with white sand. There are sun loungers to hire with big umbrellas. There are hawkers trying to sell you things but they go on their way once you indicate you are not interested. 
Maria N,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2015,"Nice beach. Great for families, lots of activities, restaurants, hotels close by. Great to watch the sunset"
SgSling,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,"Seminyak is a lovely beach, especially for watching the sunset with a few cocktails (at Kudeta).You can also surf or swim. The beach itself is not one of the most beautiful beaches as the sand is quite dark."
Ed New,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2015,"One of the coziest beach experience i have ever had. everything was just perfect.There are a lot of options available with bean bag type couches you can just chill on.Beer and food are nicely priced and you can just enjoy all that with the view of the sunset plus with live music playing in the background (they accept requests), you can even sing along with the band if you wanted to.Just say no to the vendors and they won't bother you anymore."
Sherbird,66 contributions,Mar 2016,"Much more relaxing,peaceful and cleaner compare to Kuta beach, also recommend Legian beach. La plancha beach bar and restaurant is the place to chill during sun set or early nite drinks at Seminyak beach,well there's a few next to it too. "
Helle F,"Roskilde, Denmark",Mar 2016,The sand is dark and it definitely isn't one of our favourite daytime beaches. But go just to have a drink and watch the sunset. The sunset here is beautiful and the atmosphere at night is fantastic.
nella253,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,The sad thing about Balinese beaches is the amount of rubbish about. Thankfully they have trucks and people trying to combat this problem on Seminyak beach. I didn't swim in the water this time but the sunsets were wonderful.
Tomek M,"Warsaw, Poland",Mar 2016,"Don't you ever come to Bali if looking for beautiful beaches. Crowded from vendors annoying you all day long, full of rubbish, dirty with brownish water. Extremely overpriced."
PA Deepak,"Visakhapatnam, India",Jan 2016,This Beach is very colorful and vibrant.This is very apt location for youngsters and who want to set a trend in the prawl.A place where you can find so many girls around.A good places for everyone as a wholesome.It treats everyone with its choice
DeborahMello,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2016,Beach is dirty and ugly.Went to Seminyak expecting to find a paradise beach and was frustrated. I was better enjoying the hotel pool than at the beach.If you want a beach experience go to Nusa Dua or Uluwatu regions
no(r)mandic,Groningen,Feb 2016,It is a very nice beach and we enjoyed swimming in the breakers. We were shocked by the prices of the sunloungers. 
Robert H,"Bunbury, Australia",Feb 2016,Not the best for swimming although tell that to the many who do. With the wet season the run off from the land is just too high and the rubbish etc is higher than normal.  The beaches are being tidied though but sometimes a fell their fighting a loosing battle. They must keep at it though.  A walk from Seminyak beach to Discovery Shopping Mall takes about an hour and a half walk. If the tides right and you have a bit of a head breeze it can be a beautiful walk.  
r_rladda,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,Beach is easily accessible and evenings are very pleasant. Plenty of beach shacks with live music at night. Do try parachute lamps :)
Liem T,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"People visit Seminyak Beach for the location. The beach itself is decent, but not wow-inducing by any means. It's crowded, but not as packed as Kuta Beach. And you will still be assaulted by throngs of itinerant salespeople. A brief ""makasih, tingal disini"" shall suffice.The surf is quite decent (beginner/intermediary depending on the swell) but beware: the current can be treacherous (way more than in Kuta Beach)."
ruru c,16 contributions,Mar 2016,Stayed in Seminyak for a week with our young child. Less hectic than Kuta. Restaurants top notch. Potato Head Beach Club a must go for food and sunset drinks. Will be coming back definitely. I love thefriendly Balinese nature.
YiliKR,"New York City, NY",Feb 2016,"Nice big beach that isn't dirty and full of trash unlike Kuta beach. Can rent beach lounge chairs with umbrellas, and the kids had a great time playing in the water and sand. Worth the visit! chez gado gado restaurant right ther as a good dining option as well."
Skimsa,"Bangkok, Thailand",Feb 2016,A stunning beach and a beautiful sunset. The bars and hotels that line it were amazing. The only problem is a lot of it was rough and closed so if you fancy a swim you need to be either strong or have a good day.
Errol S,"Forest Creek, Australia",Feb 2016,"It is great for a walk or to sunbathe but I had great concerns about water quality. There are a number of outlets from inland, washing all sorts of rubbish into the sea. It was not the rubbish you can see that bothered me however but what you can't see. I would strongly advise that if you did choose to swim, you not put your head under the water for obvious reasons or swim only in the hotel pools. There were a number of signs on the beach saying dangerous to swim. I was unsure if they meant danger of rips or danger from the effluent going into the sea. "
Roshni D,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,This place is great for watching sunsets. Has quite a many bars/beach side restaurants.But the beach is really dirty.
Hsphoser36,"Washington DC, DC",Feb 2016,"There is garbage and filth everywhere. Also, rivers with raw sewage run right through the beach. I ran here twice or maybe 3 times, and it was just disgusting. If you run far enough to the east, you will eventually get to a nicer color sand. However, near our hotel, this was just nasty."
hanaicha,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2015,having afternoon snack while waiting for sunset here. the view was pretty amazing. and it's not too crowd for enjoyable sunset-time.
Levilouicus,"Broome, Australia",Feb 2016,"Seminyak beach is less crowded than Kuta, still a lot of rubbish and debris in the ocean and on the shore.Nice enough to kick back and relax with a Bintang. Many resorts back into the beach.The wet season clouds make for a beautiful sunset."
Daniel B,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,Nice beach but they really do need to employ some locals to clean and maintain the beach. A lot of rubbish and building materials littering the beach.
Hassandoc90,"Aligarh, India",Feb 2016,"Centrally located, easy accessibility pretty decent food outlets good music. Best time would be sunrise and sunset. Less crowded than kuta beach."
AndrewTee78232,"San Antonio, TX",Dec 2015,"Lovely beach with fine sand, gentle breeze, and inspiring ocean front.  I like this beach better than Kuta beach.  It is cleaner, less commericialized, and much less crowded.  The hawkers seem gentler too so a person can walk around without too much hassle.  That said, there are ample ""fine"" eateries (fine dining now equals higher priced dining) with outstanding views of the beach and people in the beach.  This place is where you can have fine dining for about 10 USD in the Fall/winter of 2015"
slapstcik,singapore,Feb 2016,Very lively. Feel like jamming and listening to nice music with humble musicians (Just Us)... Playing on the beach.  from about 6-630pm onwards 
Russell B,"Caloundra, Australia",Feb 2016,"The beach in front of the resort was closed most days, probably rips or dumpers. There were surf schools near the resort but niot good surf."
TravelEatXplore,"Boston, MA",Feb 2016,"The water was really warm. The locals there are really nice. However, there are a lot of trash on the beach. I really hope the local officials take notice of the trash littering and clean it up."
Kyle A,112 contributions,Aug 2015,"The scenes there are lovely.  Great to watch the sun set.  There is a ridiculous amount of trash all over the place though, especially along the water line."
Teyam B,54 contributions,Aug 2015,"I loved this beach, the views are breathtaking. Great for surfing, you can rent lounge chairs if you're ok with spending the money. There's places to eat along the beach and watch the sun sets. The only thing I didn't like was the vendors walking around trying to sell things, they won't leave you alone so you have to be firm if you're not interesting in purchasing anything. "
Jeffsreview,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is nothing special, it is walking distance from a number of hotels. the sand is not clean white sand like you see on Australian beaches, but it is pleasant enough to sit back and relax on."
Hans v,"Goes, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,We have been to Bali a number of times in Jan/Feb and on every occasion on the Kuta - Seminyak beaches it is the same:nice beach but man what a lot of rubbish. Apparently it all washes in from the sea (plastics mainly) and the authorities (?) do not know how to handle it. Halfhearted attempts are made to clean up every now and again but nowhere near enough. I appreciate it's not an easy problem but with all that money poring in from the tourist industry I'm convinced a lot mre could be done.
T9176DFmarym,"West Wales, UK",Feb 2016,"Sea very rough, lots of red flags up, my partner did go in swimming  but as he was walking into the sea stepped into a large hole which was quite a shock.  Nice large expanse of beach to walk on but you did tend to sink in the sand."
brows_,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,"With a whole range of great restaurants, day clubs and hotels, Seminyak is a lovely area of Bali. Away from the hustle of rough tourists, it offers a surprising level of quality and professionalism. Great area to stay. "
WipamasBee,"Bangkok, Thailand",Feb 2016,Even they tried to clean the beach in the morning. But not every day got lots of plastics on the beach and in the water. Locals are nice and friendly. A peaceful beach sort of. 
EgleDesigns,"Shanghai, China",Feb 2016,"We didn't surf at Seminyak beach but walked it a lot. Great for running too. Like any other beach in the area, there are a lot of dogs running around, and they do leave their business in the sand, so mind your feet. What upset me was, westerns who own dogs here also put a blind eye to it. They don't clean after their dogs.There were quite a few storms out in the sea, so there was a lot of rubbish on the beach which is understandable, and in some areas it is being cleared all the time. However, I saw many people, especially locals just leaving their rubbish on the beach after watching the sunsets, even though the bins were right behind them. A bit upsetting. "
Dheeny,"Fujairah, United Arab Emirates",Feb 2016,"We went to the beach around Ku De Ta (enter from KuDeTa passage), recommended to go in the morning around 9 if you bring young kids or baby as the wave can be quite rough in the afternoon and the heat can be too much for them. You can rent beach chairs (2 chairs+1 umbrella) at IDR 100.000 for 3 hours and have sips of fresh coconuts (idr 30.000).I would say the beach is clean enough, it's not that you'd get tons of rubbish on ur foot as some reviews saying it's a dirty beach.. ;)"
Amanda N,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"You can't leave Bali without coming here! The atmosphere is so amazing, fun friendly faces, so much to see and do, restaurants, bars! Double Six Beach is the place to be!"
GiaRosen,"Atlanta, GA",Feb 2016,"We just walked along the beach, it was very nice and pretty popular full of kids relaxing, smoking and drinking - looked like a great day to spend a Sunday Funday.."
roomraid,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,"Without doubt the dirtiest beach I've ever experienced, water was full of rubbish and the beach was littered as far as the eye can see. My recommendation is to avoid it and just go sit in one of the resorts by the pool"
Tanya-Maree,"Waiheke Island, New Zealand",Aug 2015,Definitely not a swimming beach so be aware that if you book hotels near you cannot swim (too many rips).  Great for a walk on the beach or sunbathing.
Visinesti,"Vancouver, Canada",Feb 2016,"Free public beach. You need to rent lounge chair and umbrella. We were here during the rainy season and there were quite high waves, making it difficult to swim. Not very clean with debris washing up the shore."
Jack B,3 contributions,Jan 2016,It is a beautiful place and much cleaner than anything in Kuta. Not as many hagglers as well. Highly recommend!
Raskolnikow,"Neckartailfingen, Germany",Oct 2015,Wide and clean beach along Seminyak. It offers miles of walking and many opportunities for waves to learn surfing. If you go for a walk try to avoid the little ‚Äúrivers‚Äù that flow into the see. The smell reveals that this is not fresh water.Unfortunately this is not the white dream beach with a backdrop of palm trees that you imagine when you dream of Bali.
Irene T,"Glasgow, UK",Feb 2016,I went here with my fianc√© to relax for the day & it was amazing.  Really clean beach with lots of food places/stalls nearby.! Highly recommend ! 
gil749,"Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Australia",Jan 2016,Astonished at the filthy beach and locals using drains to beach as a toilet. All the people lazing around you'd think some of them could pick up on the beaches and though a fares.
Greg A,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Hard to beat at sunset. The most attractive of the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak strip of beaches.Although other posts have mentioned rubbish etc, it was clean when we were there (several visits, from 21-27 Jan 2016), although it rained every day. We were at the southern end - apparently the stream in the north near the temple can bring out rubbish after rain.Negotiate for umbrella lounges on the beach - we paid IDR50,000 for a 2-bed lounge, which is probably expensive, but, hey, for $5 all day, who cares? The same chap who sells you the lounge can also supply you with well-priced cold drinks (coke, beer, coconuts etc).Note for foreign tourists - you can't sit on the lounges for free 'just for 10 minutes', as we saw several tourists try to do, including a couple of female Australians who wanted to change their toddler's nappy (!). The lounges are rented, it's how those guys make their living - if they let everyone sit on the lounges 'just for 10 minutes', they wouldn't make a rupiah.There are some sellers trawling the beach, but they're not too pushy, and perhaps not as numerous as in Kuta and Legian.You can just sit on your towels on the beach for free, but you might get burnt that way.There are numerous beach shacks south of Jl. Camplung Tanduk, they are cheap and good for burgers, juices and beer.Surf is good for boogie boarding and body surfing. Gets a bit rough and erratic, with some cross-currents, at the end of low tide, be careful near the breakers at this time.If you're lucky enough to be from a place with outstanding beaches (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Hawaii, California),  you might think this beach is not much. But by world standards it is very pleasant and enjoyable. Recommended."
sharlinge,singapore,Dec 2015,The beach is pretty normal. Rather dirty sand in fact. Worth a skip unless you plan to chill at their bars. We witnessed a cremation ceremony there.  Interesting to see how people can throw the ashes and swim within such close proximity
Prit Swami,"Surat, India",Feb 2016,"Nothing in the beach, no rides, no shag, nothing to do, just a visit that to I'd time permits. As major hotels have their private beaches, so much crowd is expected. "
simone m,United Kingdom,Feb 2016,"nice beach, best palces to go if you want a subbed day our the private resorts with access to beaches, but this was our local beach, beach clean with many surfers, toilet access and food and beverage"
Paul B,Albury NSW Australia,Feb 2016,"all restaurant facities are fantastic, the food is great and the staff are freindly and helpful, it is the people of Bali who make the holiday experinec what it is - amazing"
Andrew P,"Mitcham, Australia",Feb 2016,"Yes, there are a fair bit of rubbish laying around, but grab a lounge and relax with a drink.   It's just an OK beach.  There are better places to sit at a beach restaurant - Jimbaran Beach seafood restaurants for example.  Seminyak Beach has the beachside cafes tho.  In good weather it's worth the trip.  "
Harold_J_Potter,"Byron Bay, Australia",Feb 2016,"I have to concur with some of the others who have reviewed this beach, in particular Leylandbros who reviewed only yesterday. I walked from my hotel this afternoon looking forward to a nice walk on the beach following a lovely few days in Ubud. My initial impression was ugh, but I  proceeded to walk hoping things would get better. In the end my partner and I were so disgusted by the amount of rubbish on the sand that we had to leave, vowing never to set foot on this beach again. I was horrified by the beaches of Sihanoukville but this is the Wes Craven version of horror! :-( "
sbstn1985,"Rome, Italy",Feb 2016,Only go there for sunset... if you want to spend a nice beach day go somewhere else like Uluwatu... or stay in your villa's pool!
Braucic B,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2016,"Know Seminyak beach for years, When was not busy and with famous 66 Club. Now the beach is much more touristic with plenty of good choices.One of my favorite.   "
Simone P,4 contributions,Feb 2016,"Perfect end to a sun soaked day! Bintangs and sunsets...üçª lots of beach bars to choose from, with colourful beanbags and live music to chill to."
Leylandbros,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"It is rare for me to be so horrified and critical but my walk down the beach on the 4th of February, 2016, was shocking. Due to heavy rain the previous day, a huge amount of rubbish and waste had been flushed out into the waters of the beach. There were signs up saying that swimming was not permitted - due to the high levels of Coliforms in the water. Several of the Hotels were attempting to clean up some of the rubbish on the section of the beach. It seemed like a losing battle. It is so sad for the people of Bali that this happens on a regular basis. "
LindaMay,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Feb 2016,Have been to Seminyak several times and though still beautiful on high tide and sunset was disappointed how dirty many sections were on low tide.
mollercph,"Rawai, Thailand",Feb 2016,"The beach is filthy. Plastic bottles, cigarette buds and plastic bags every were. The lounge chairs are overpriced. The locals try to get somewhere between 50.000-200.000 IR.souvenir sellers bother you every five minutes and the restaurants and bars play loud music all day. Not much of the Balinese magic there.It's great for surfers. And I enjoyed a day in the sun on my Bintang towel in the sand. Was very happy to catch some rays after 4 days of rain and no sun."
Kennedy_Chimp,24 contributions,Feb 2016,"A nice sandy beach that's not too crowded, we reached the place at about 8, most of the crowd from sunset watching would have left. Nothing much to rave about, the seafood wasn't as cheap as acclaimed, neither was it good.The only saving grace was the corn, a man with his push cart peddling his corn with his kerosene lamp. That was the best corn I had, the ones in Kuta just didn't make the mark.Be sure to grab one when you're there!"
Matt C,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,Not my favourite beach in the world.Went on an overcast day so that didn't help sell it to me but over all this beach is fine but a bit dirty (rubbish). Plenty of medium sized surf (if that's what your into). Heaps of beachside bars with sofa beds / bean bags for you to crash out. Overall it's ok.  
Bachir M,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jan 2016,"i visited the beach in Jan 16 during the raining season, it's a great beach to walk along the coast and watch the sunset, during my visit the beach was full of big waves and surfers, very clean and visiting the beach is a must."
SanClemenRAM,"Quincy, MA",Feb 2016,"This is a nice beach with lots of sand and numerous local vendors looking to make a quick buck. You can buy beer, soda and chips. You can rent an umbrella/cabana. Numerous surfboard rentals. Or you can just walk the beach. The only off is the large amount of trash all over the beach. It is a tragedy that so much trash is polluted into the ocean and that the vendors don't help clean it up."
PearlySim,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,Splendid!  Love the beach and the swells. Be sure to take time to read the waves first before jumping in. 
Kat59623,United Kingdom,Mar 2015,"Long beach, not overcrowded. Beautiful scenery. Hot spot for all surfers and young people. Nice place!"
Eg007,"Bennebroek, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,We enjoyed it but please take the effort to get rid of all the rubbish on the beach and in the water.
Kruti B,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2016,Its one of the nice and clean beach with good amount of restaurants and cafes. Easy to reach and has great sunsets. The tides are relatively low so good to swim
haz2016,"Brunei-Muara District, Brunei Darussalam",Dec 2015,The beaches of Seminyak are simply divine! You see Nature's masterpiece everywhere you turn. Will definitely be back!
SCLaus85,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"The only stand-out was its sunsets. Otherwise the sand is quite dark, water was a bit rough and there was a bit of rubbish. Depends on the type of beaches you're used to experiencing, I guess. "
JamesLesmana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Nice to play at evening. Along the beach has many cafe, wide and long beach. A good spot for  viewing sunset"
lesley s,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,This beach was ok and a bit cleaner than some but too rough most of the time for an old wimpy non surfer! Some quirky beach cafes with colorful beanbag seats and umbrellas giving the place a nice vibe!
Josephine V,12 contributions,Feb 2016,We liked this beach especially after seeing Kuta Beach which was very dirty . the beach is large so the closer you are to Legian it gets a little dirty and busy but if you are Closer to Petingenget is quite and very nice . Also you don't have a million sellers following you . there are better beaches in Bali but it was a good experience .   
domfrase,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Feb 2016,"Good restaurants/ bars along the beach, great for sunset.  Like most southern beaches in Bali more rubbish than you would expect, and at night they open water from the city into the sea, from the smell as it goes in I will never swim here again!  Further north a little cleaner I think, but still got sick after swallowing too much water failing at learning to surf.  Slightly less crowded than Kuta, more than Berawa."
Em T,"Bulleen, Australia",Jun 2015,Seminyak doesn't have the nicest beaches. Nusa Dua (although a fair distance away) is where i would recommend if you'd like to go swimming in crystal clear blue water and bake on golden sand. Seminyak beach has choppy waves (similar to the gold coast) and is overall not as pleasant. 
Nicole C,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"This was the beach where my partner proposed to me (in a quieter area with no hagglers) was beautiful! Almost no rubbish compared to Kuta which was covered in rubbish. We hired beach chairs for 50,000 IDR (around $5 AUS) for 2 hours and beers were around $2.50 each for a Bintang aswell so made the day nice and relaxing. Prepare to get hassled by people selling stuff but just say no or ignore them and continue relaxing. "
Callum C,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,Great beach to visit in the rainy season. Kuta & legion beaches were full of rubbish from the weather. however it seemed to be a lot less in Seminyak and also beach restaurants had bean bag settings in the afternoon which was cool.
A. N. S,31 contributions,Feb 2016,"Seminyak is a great place for surfing, chill out at the bars with live music performance. Plenty of bars around there. You can buy a drink at the restaurant and get a shaded umbrella instead of renting sun bed. Surfing board can be rented at rp 40000 an hour. Instructor will cost rp 50000 an hour."
Dave Alexius,"East Java, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"I went here just want to see the famous Seminyak Beach. I came before noon, unfortunately there were not so many people there. I think it must be crowded in the afternoon when peoples want to see the sunset at the beach. Around the beach you can find luxury hotels and restaurants."
Aaron W,25 contributions,Feb 2016,"After being to all the beautiful beaches between Nusa dua and Uluwatu, this was a real let down. Went for a walk along here, was abysmal. Really dull looking beach littered with rubbish. "
Helena Yuri S N,16 contributions,Feb 2016,"Seminyak is the best place I love to visit. Not too crowded but enjoyable life here. Beautiful beach with some good atmosphere of beach clubs like potato head, kudeta, Woobar to spend time waiting sunset"
Jean-Maxime T,35 contributions,Feb 2016,"The Seminyak beach is a really nice beach. But with all the people there, it's hard to really enjoy the calm or the ocean. There is also several people trying to sell stuff all the way and everywhere. Not the kind of beach to relax. Good place to enjoy a drink or beer. In february, the ocean is hard to swim at this place."
NevyLam,"London, UK",Jan 2016,"We went on 5 different beaches in Bali, but liked this one. Water is very clean also the beach is kept clean. It is not crowded and you can enjoy the sun in peace. Ignore all the sellers by just saying ""thank you"" and they will not disturb you more. Nearby is a lot fof restaurants and coffee shops, also taxis."
egginton2015,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,There is no real direction to the beach in seminyak. One end is carpark and the other is through the hotels and resorts. There is no board walk as such. If your staying in one of the hotels on the beach that would be fine.
Sonya H,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Walked five minutes down the road from our hotel to Seminyak beach and what a disappointment!! Black sand, stray dogs sleeping under chairs, rubbish and hawkers selling their wares. Only upside was the water was warm. Preferred to stay at our hotels man made beach"
Marianna K,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"We walked from Kuta to Seminyak via Legian, it was quite long walk but worth it! Very crowded places but the sceneries were unique and beautiful! Night walk on the beach was very pleasant with lights from resorts and sounds of wave although it was rainy. "
Jen R,"Alameda, CA",Feb 2016,We arrived here walking up the path at sunset. Having come from ubud it was surreal dripping into the beach party that was going on but we didn't hesitate! Drinks and apps at la plancha were great. Fun friendly people to talk to not. Next morning came down again and walked about a mile checking out the waves. The water is so warm it's like a bathtub. There are several surf schools including a Riptide school that looked fun. Cost approx $60-$85usd. Disappointing amount of litter washed up along the beach. The restaurants nearer us like la plancha clear it away. I think the restaurants and resorts should all pitch in the clean up the beach. Good for business and for the environment. Hawkers were there but pleasant and didn't keep pushing after you say no unlike what we experienced in ubud. 
Velarie,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,Nice view and lively area..though dogs are running freely there too. Be careful on their poops at your feet too.
naunidhsingh,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2016,Anyone who wantsto stay away from the hustle bustle of Kuta should definitely try Seminyak. Much more upscale and full of good restaurants and cafes unlike the loud area of Kuta.
BaliTiger2,"Balikesir, Turkey",Jan 2016,"This is my local beach. At the Petitenget Temple car park. Beautiful LA Lucciola is here for Italian dining.The resorts on the beach work hard to keep the beach clean but after a rain, it can be daunting. I find around May/June that I can't walk along the beach because of high tides that make the sand very steep and soft"
Chandangoyal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Dec 2015,"I visited seminyak in dec, 2015. Very beautiful views from the beach. the weather is amazing. Overall a very wonderful experience"
emzeperx,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jan 2016,"Does not offer too much, though quite relaxing. At least definitely less litter here than at other beaches. Great for a big walk"
ccelan,"Baltimore, MD",Jan 2016,"We stayed at an amazing hotel on Seminyak Beach - I have no complaints and would return in a heartbeat- that being said the beach is quite dirty with dog poo and other litter being brought in from the ocean. Maybe if the tides were different, the beaches would be a bit cleaner. I did love how many people walked early in the morning and watched the sun set in the evening, such a wonderful community. "
Highkit,"Leeds, UK",Jan 2016,"Great beach to walk along and just take in the view, especially the sunset. Parts of the beach are cleaned regularly but a lot of debris builds up after a storm. Offerings are placed on the beach near the river from Seminyak. Take notice of the lifeguard flags on the beach because the tides can be very strong.  Bella located near the Breeze sells good sarongs but bargaining is required."
JohnTGN,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"As we walked along one morning from our hotel we sad to see how many plastic bags and dead fish were found on the beach! It's a disgrace to be frank and local governments need to take action. The waters are warm and overall the beach is nice and great for a stroll, but I was so sad to see these poor fish and even an old turtle that had washed up along with plastic bags. The local hotels have a great location on the beach and a real asset in the beach that needs much love and care!"
star5_11,"Inverness, UK",Jun 2015,"Lovely beach at sunset, great cheap bars along the beach as well as the W Hotel for cocktails would recommend"
preplady,Virginia,Jan 2016,"very wide & beautiful beach. Great for taking long strolls.  We were there in mid-day, but I bet sunsets would be great here.  Only odd thing:  only saw two doves during maybe 2 hours there, no seagulls, no sandpipers, no anything else.  Wonder why not!"
Adam T,Venice,Dec 2015,"The beach is a nice beach not the white sands that you get in Thailand, but lots of places to stop by for a drink and watch life go by."
Angela E,Buckingham,Jan 2016,"Staying for 8 nights - finding it very organised, comfortable and clean.  Probably just a little impersonal for us to re visit. "
SalvaTravel,Melbourne,Jan 2016,"I wasn't particularly impressed with Seminyak beach, I did go for a walk most mornings on my visit to Bali past it though it did appear quite dirty at times. "
Greg R,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is not like a white sand pacific beach, personally I didn't like it and opted to swim at our villas pool.A lot of the beach was closed off to swimmers due to rips, remember to swim between the flags.There were also lots of flies and hawkers!"
michlaz21,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"Great beach for morning walks, you will find local and tourist enjoying the morning walks, jogs and surf In the morning.  In the evening you have the perfect setting to watch the sunset! "
esptm,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,Walked down for a quick look after dinner.  Very pretty with lanterns from the restaurants. Strong waves.
Robert F,4 contributions,Jan 2016, Just Pick a Restraunt have a drink arrive before 5pm and watch the sunset and all the action of Bali unfold. 
akm515,"Windsor, UK",Jan 2016,The beach is impressive. It's not white sand and crystal water by its clean and there are plenty of loungers and a good price. The guys that run the loungers have a good selection of drinks and hire body boards at a very reasonable price. There are some good bars along the beach apparently but we didn't make it that far. We did eat in a restaurant just off the beach which was very good. Definitely worth a look for a swim to cool down from the intense heat and fun if you like waves. 
Natalie C,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"Great night out spent by the beach, relaxing on the provided bean bags listening to live music in the background until sunset then into the night. A selection of eateries to choose from whilst on the beach, from local food to pub style food.  Couldn't ask for a better night.. "
LittleNickyA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,I love coming down to Seminyak beach at any time of day. It's beautiful to walk or swim first thing in the morning before breakfast when the beach is super quiet. It's great to spend the day here and have lunch at the warungsalong the beach and perfect for sunset drinks 
sammybeel,"Bells Beach, Australia",Jan 2016,"This beach is clean compared to most of the other beaches in bali. I've been traveling to bali for thirty years and the water is getting clogged with rubbish!! For some reason Seminyak beach is free of rubbish. The beach it self is great, I've always been able to get a fun wave here and generally to my self. Overall it's a great beach for everyone!"
Michelle S,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"The water is warm and the sand burns your feet so make sure you wear thongs. Seminyak Beach is a great swimming beach for the young and old and the odd Bali dog that came's down to cool off due to the heat and humidity(I'm sure 1 dog I was watching was trying to body surf). My son hired a surfboard for 2 weeks which cost him $10.00 a day and my 14 year old daughter tried her hand at surfing a longboard for $5.00 an hour. The hawkers can be a tad annoying, wanting you to buy more sarongs, elephant trinkets, glasses and watches, but if they don't ask you once they will ask you 100 times. There are some great bars and restaurants along the beach too that have great food and acoustic bands to listen too and the Sunset is just perfect. "
Chris S,"Seattle, WA",Jan 2016,"Title says it all, little more upscale with a string of beach front restaurants,  many of which offer live nightly music.  Great place to watch the sunset or the night fishers.  Fewer hawkers than kuta but they're all present. "
Donna B,"Bunbury, Australia",Jan 2016,"Staying at double six hotel has allowed us to use the beach daily for running and swimming which has been wonderful.The beach is clean without any rubbish in the oceanPerfect for swimming, the current is strong swimmers need to be aware of the undertow"
allison9723,"New York City, NY",Dec 2015,"You don't go to Seminyak for the beach. You go for the upscale restaurants and shopping. Which are amazing. The beach has a few nice clubs on it for sunset watching, but in terms of pretty, don't expect much. "
kate b,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jan 2016,"white sand with gentle waves and when the tide is out...you can walk for miles.  follows aroud Seminyak, so many places to stop for coffee, drinks or dining. "
Janelle T,"Woolooware, Australia",Jan 2016,"Got sun lounges and umbrellas 6 for 200,000 rupiah. Water was cold and only 10,000 rupiah. Water was clean. Surf not overly big"
Theadventuresofliv,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2015,"Not my favourite beach but it's better than some of the others along the kuta, seminyak front. The best beaches are out on Bukit Peninsula or even down Cangu way. "
Cara Holland,"Croydon, Australia",Feb 2015,"It was a nice beach to look over from the hotel pool, or walk up late evening to see sunset, but too many people trying to sell crap made us avoid it for the most part. Also its quite dirty from the storm water from streets, I wouldnt swim there. The beers in the bean bags at night are nice though!"
Keithbath D,"Chippenham, UK",Dec 2015,"Plenty to do here with eating places around, not always cleaned to perfection but worth a visit beware of sales touts which can be annoying"
ratnadws,"Malang, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"I waste my time with my friend in seminyak and when the sunset come, we went to seminyak beach for enjoy the sunset view. its too awesome!!"
Grahame_11,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"I have to admit I didn't like it when all the bar/restaurants starting opening along this stretch of the beach. But now it seems to be a great place to drop by as the sun sets, stroll along with a bit of low key haggling if you are badly in need of a carved coconut shell, a genuine $5 rolex or a $2 pair of sunnies that your being asked $20 for.Then after your stroll hop on a bean bag and drink the amber liquid. Really pleasant way to end the day.Oh, and I think the very best way to start the day is a vigorous walk, get the heart rate up a little, then do a few sprints up the dunes to really get the blood moving. Drop down and do a push up or a plank. Do any of the above. But make sure to take in the crisp curling waves drumming out the beat for a brand new Bali day."
Karen E,"Glenelg, Australia",Jan 2016,"Spent the new years eve on the beach watching the sunset as 2015 turned to 2016...fireworks all around us , the air filled with the sounds of laughter and many different languages...amazing experience...magic.."
David H,Stanmore,Oct 2015,What a beautiful and compelling resort. The beach and surrounding town has everything from great beach clubs to every cuisine you could wish for in the town as well as amazing and varied night life. Beautiful hotels and stunning scenery.
dumbquestion,"Athelstone, Australia",Jan 2016,"Golden sand, slight swell, a bit of a rip between the red flags, and people swimming. What more does one need. A bit cleaner perhaps."
Albert M,"Lisbon, Portugal",Jan 2016,Quite liked this beach.  Was wonderful to spend the day and swim.  Sunsets are breath taking.  Many vendors but they don't bother you to much.  Didn't feel to crowded.  You could either partake in the scene or not.  
Leigh H,"The Ponds, Australia",Jan 2016,"I you would like a safe beach paddle around at, this is the one for you. easy double break waves that are great for small and old."
Emily S,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Accessible by every major hotel and a place to chill or be served chilled drinks, perhaps even some beach side yoga if thats your thing... If you are in the area you cannot miss the beach!"
mskatie1959,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"Love all the Bars with choices of tables & chairs or bean bags on the sand. Bean bags are best. Live entertainment most nights.  Food good & not expensive, beer prices not much more than you pay at a mini-mart.  Great to spend a hot night there cooling off, enjoying the beautiful sunsets. "
HayleyLauren,"Redhill, UK",Aug 2015,"Went here for a day whilst travelling with friends in August 2015. It was a nice day at the beach, not too busy and not too many people pestering us to buy things so we could relax. It was quite clean too. The area we sat in didn't have many places nearby to buy food and drinks from but I'm pretty sure there was lots further down. I don't surf but there were lots of people surfing and the waves looked pretty good for it. Definitely worth a visit."
Jenny T,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,The view was the best. You can see the reflection of the sky on the sand with a thin layer of the sea water. 
Clairetwicks,"Twickenham, london",Jan 2016,"Very chilled. Dark coloured sand due to it being a volcanic island. Indian Ocean so lots of big waves! It is so much fun jumping themüòä there are a few sun loungers with umbrellas, usually you will pay around Rp 150,000 to use, do not be scared to barter! It is fantastic at night with a couple of chilled bars playing live music. "
Daniel F,"Taipei, Taiwan",Dec 2015,"long and vast beach, good for jogging. garbage gets cleaned every morning. some locals sell coconuts (yumm). in the evening many peopel at the beach watching the sunset and kids playing in the waves. Great fun."
David R,Sydney,Jan 2016,"Like with the whole beach stretch in the area, it is now filled with ""bean bag bars"" and beach hawkers. While it is a bit cleaner than the stretch toward Kuta, a beach is a beach. Great spot to relax and watch the sunset if you are in the area."
Benjamin W,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,Great sunset but the beaches are full of rubbish here. White sand beaches do exsist in Bali but not here. 
kapshure,SF,Feb 2015,"I actually traveled to Bali in 2006, but this was a very beautiful beach to be experienced and enjoyed. The sunsets in Bali are amazing, as well as the food, and the people were above friendly to me in every way. I dream about returning to Bali often"
linggar87,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,Bali never fails when come to sunset. It's always perfect. Really enjoying spend our time here. You can enjoy the sunset at the nearly cafe.
95laura372,"London, UK",Jan 2016,A nice easy way to have a relaxing couple of days. Some great Beach sellers with whom you can have some good banter. The sea is rough at times my partner nearly lost his swimmers a couple of times. Some nice bars and restaurants to loose a few hours with good food and Bingtang.
jacqueline f,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"We arrived just as most tourists where heading home , so less crowds. The beach was clean, not to many sellers. You do have to buy chairs etc but that's normal. So cheap."
Duncananan,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,Spoilt by beaches in Australia I can only rate this one as average. The breeze off the water and the open space were fabulous after a day in the heat and humidity in town. The water looked pretty rough but was quite warm round the ankles - trying to avoid stepping on rubbish was a bit tedious.
Quarnda,"Houston, TX",Oct 2015,My girls and I took a million pictures. the most fun I have ever had at a beach in my life!!! definitely a must see
Jaad87,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"Can be very crowded and touristy. Nice to watch the sunset. Many bars have live music playing, why they insist on playing western music covers i will never understand.. pricier than local places.."
Alex  B,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2015,Cool beach with lots of eating spots along the beachfront. Most of them have some live acoustic music too. Make sure you sit in the middle of the mix so you don't get music from the place next to you
Erik D,"Pasig, Philippines",Jan 2016,This beach is very crowded and it needs a lot of litter-clearning.  I was walking around beach and you could see all kinds of trash stuck in the blackish gray sand.  It's a good thing that Bali had a lot more to offer aside from this beach.
privali,Cooktown,Jan 2016,"Fantastic fireworks on NYE, completely mad!  Spent several evenings for sunset and drinks.  Plenty of eating and drinking options, beach long and wide, room for everyone.  Colourful and alive."
jbdave,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Beach was clean when we were there.  Sunsets were beautiful, and having dinner on the sand at the local restaurant was pretty awesome.Make sure you negotiate a price to rent the deck chairs.  There can be a difference between the vendors.  That said, for a few bucks, to have someone bringing you down drinks all day is quite relaxing.   Especially when a nice ocean breeze comes on.  The biggest problem (as with all beaches in Bali) are the vendors that hassle you continuously to buy their products.  Mind you, my wife wasn't complaining while getting a foot massage."
Petros14,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2016,"great beach and easier to exercise than the street, get there early it does get busy. Great surfing lessons if that is what your after as well"
katjo9393,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2016,its a real shame since the beach looked realy good and has a great view of the sunset but its was so dirty so we didn't stay very long
Y.E.S,Australia,Jan 2016,It was a good beach. You are able to purchase some shade... Rent an umbrella. It is worth it since the sun is blazing. Close to the markets. Surfing lessons are available for you as well and if you are a surfer then surf boards for rent to you. 
Maninder K,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,beautiful place one of my favorite place to go.words are less to describe the beauty .love Balinese beach bars 
Fiona K,"Stockholm, Sweden",Dec 2015,Lots of rubbish on the beach which has come down from the highlands.  Would be a lovely beach if the local authorities stopped making excuses and got the rubbish and recycling under control in Bali. I understand why everyone stays in the pool. 
Beviho,"Stavanger, Norway",Dec 2015,Best place to watch the sunset! They replace all the sun-lounges in the evening with big bean bag chairs and you can sit with a nice drink and enjoy the sunset. Lots of people and lots of music. Also great for an after sunset swim if you have had enough sun all day.
LesleynD,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Coming from Western Australia, nothing beats our sunset. Most of the time we were there it was cloudy so not much of a sunset to wow us. Too busy and those beach side bars play really loud music. Too many beach vendors and not very clean beach although they try to clean it up, still heaps of rubbish washed up."
Ruth G,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,Stunning sunsets while sitting on the beach having a cold beer that can be purchased from one of the many vendors. New Years Eve was spectacular with fire works all along the beach as far as the eyes could see Potato head to the right and Kuta to the left
Ty chi,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,We walked along the beach a few times to go to Potato Head and to get back to our villa. We found that there are less hawkers along this beach so it makes for a more peaceful beach outing. The sunset was also a sight to behold.
Nessb80,"South Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"We're from Perth so not quite the white sandy beaches we have at home still get gorgeous sunsets. Gets really busy with bikes and cars walking to the beach. Walking on the sand seemed safe enough only your feet do get pretty dirty. They clean the beach in the morning I think. Although we only ever went in the evening wasn't too bad aside from New Years Day night. I personally wouldn't swim there as I'm freaked out by the black sand and not being able to see the bottom, but there were quite a few swimmers and surfers. It's pretty cool to sit in one of the many bars on bean bags where you still get a great view without sitting right on the black sand. "
chrls_m,"Tamworth, Australia",Jan 2016,Clean and well maintained beach.Beach lounges available to hire.Beach massage.Lots of hawkers.Resturants on the beach.Safety flags.Great swimming.Prepare for the sun and wind.
MARKtheSPARKY,"Bundaberg, Australia",Jan 2016,Too packed with everyone letting off fireworks didn't feel safe at all. I'm sure on a normal night or day would be a great place just went on a busy time! 
Marcia L,Melbourne,Jan 2016,"Seminyak beach is filthy and so is the water. The idea of swimming or relaxing here is unthinkable. It should be cleaned up. It would be a simple matter to organise a Clean up Seminyak Beach event, and I read in one of the local What's On magazines that there is such an event. If it exists, it's not working. Littering should be penalised, as there is litter everywhere."
kcr852,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2015,"The beach is crowded, but it's still beautiful. Loads of hotels where you can pop in and out of the loo / to grab a drink if needed.Rented two deck chairs + a body board for 150k for around 4-5 hours to the far right of Ku De Tah, which was decent enough, though you could probably get it lower if you tried harder.Sunset is wonderful from here - an absolute stunner. Just make sure you get a close seat to the sea unless you want people in your pictures :)"
Waz M,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,"Seminyak beach is clean, open and easy to get to. Hotels on the beach front are easy to slip in and out of for drinks and fun."
3kidsStavanger,Stavanger,Dec 2015,"Its Bali, the beach offers all you could want in terms of sunning, walking, swimming, surfing, happy hour options, etc.  We spent a lot of time there, and no complaints....but, was disappointed that so few of the private/public beaches were routinely cleaned after the days high tides.  Surrounded by all this greatness but you walk along a lot of trash and have things brushing up on your leg as you wade in the water.  No reason/excuse for this given the availability of cheap labor, equipment that can clean large areas quickly, etc.  Only real negative of our entire visit."
Raincityguy,"Vancouver, Canada",Dec 2015,"Seminyak offers a fabulous flat sandy beach that most days is overrun with visitors.  Like many other tropical beaches this one has its share of trash that you have to step around : plastic bags and bottles, discarded food containers, bits of clothing.  So much money is made by the local businesses you would think that they would spend a little to clean up the treasure that nature has provided.    "
Luana C,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"A fabulous beach to walk along and visit iconic Seminyak eateries such as KU DE TAH, Potato Head, W Hotel and more. The waters are quite rough, so swim at your own risk- some areas are patrolled; there are many surfers too. There can be a lot of rubbish when there has been a storm. A great beach walk!!"
tukangbaso,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,We went here for enjoying the sunset. Rent 2 beach chair for 100k and drinking cold beer while enjoying the sunset right in front of us. Paradise!
Payangan 1969,"Okinawa City, Japan",Jan 2016,"We spent New Year's Eve on this beach. Was a fab beach. Was busy being the end of the year. Plenty of seats bean bags. On the night it's self bean bags can be used with minimum spend of 150,000 rupiah. Not sure if this is the same cost throughout the year. Next morning tractors cleaned the beach so it became spotless once again"
Ashleigh_Auld89,"Hertfordshire, UK",Jan 2016,"Nice beach, not hassled, lots to do (surf / swim / bars) or just chill out. Telling me to write more but not much more to write :)"
Juan C,"Sunshine West, Australia",Jan 2016,"I went a couple of times to the beach but didn't get in the water, big waves mostly for surfers. Sand dirty, it seems tractors are not used everyday to clean the rubish.  Lots of sun shades and sunbathing stretchers for 3 AUD but you need to bargain otherwise you'll be paying 20 in AUD .Crowded in this time if the year.New year at the beach watching the fireworks was fine.Some good restaurants others not good at all.Smells like sweage in some areas.Anyway just average.Judge by yourself."
HaSiKh,Philippines,Dec 2015,"It is a great beach but just like all beaches are. Mornings are great and so are the evenings with fantastic colors in the sky; and an awesome sunset. What makes it interesting is the party scene in the evenings during sunset. The beach is relatively clean. At various places there are small hut-like restaurants that offer chairs and towels for rent - about IDR 50k for an hour. Drinks like Bintang usually cost about IDR 25k. At some places, the beach is cleaner as it is in front of an expensive resort like ku-de-ta or potato head and the likes.The party scene lights up during evenings with colorful bean bags all over the place, colorful people on it and the colorful sky ... all making the place really colorful. The place is like a music fest of sorts in the evenings. Wonderful to be here during that time. Mornings are serene and great for a run. Sun rises from the other side and hence the coolness is longer in the mornings making it ideal for a run.In short, OK beach, not the best in the world. Great for partying and overall feel."
jaye_w,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2015,"Hip, cafe culture. Good restaurants. Surf wear shops galore. May be good to grab a meal or chill at the numerous sports bars around the area. "
Marea J,"Woollahra, Australia",Apr 2015,The beach was very dirty as was the water. We saw a number of dead animals on the beach and a lot if rubbish. Not the place for swimming or relaxing.
Triana S,42 contributions,Dec 2015,"We love this beach because so beautiful and so clean. Easy to find good hotel, good shops, good restaurants and coffee shops.Suitable place for couple, family with kids and large groups. "
Ceilidh A,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2016,Walking along a beach is allows nice though the rubbish detracted from the experience a bit. We rented a beach bed under an umbrella in a clean section and it was really enjoyable. 
D_R_SydneyAU,Sydney,Dec 2015,Wouldn't come to this beach other than to watch the sunset.  Water warm but the beach was quite dirty. Rubbish everywhere. I guess blame it on the people rather than the beach. Even saw a syringe :( the sunset was amazing though. Pull up a beanbag at one of the beach bars with a drink and just enjoy.
Samuel R,"Fairy Meadow, Australia",Dec 2015,"Visited briefly and it looked really nice, but just very hectic with tourists as to be expected in Seminyak."
priyakumar2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,The Seminyak beach has many good restaurants. It was very vibrant and especially the sunset dining was great.
sbak85,"Nilai, Malaysia",Jan 2015,"The beach is beautiful, less crowded than Legian Beach..You can come here just for relaxing..One of the top beach in Bali"
Jennifer V,"Sequim, WA",Dec 2015,"When dreaming of Bali we anticipated lazy days of the beach, which is where we headed out first thing when we arrived. We were so disappointed with the trash all over the beach, the swimming prohibition flags, and lack of any good place to lay out and make a good beach day possible. After less than an hour by the ocean we reevaluated our priorities and planned to spend the rest of our stay visiting the cultural sights instead."
Leah B,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great beach at night Balinese families and travellers all mingle and relax  watching the sunset  , beautiful location "
BSWAustralia,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Dec 2015,"Our son did some surfing here with one of the locals. He is quite competent but needed someone to help with the local conditions. Would suit a beginner though. Importantly, there's a flagged and patrolled area outside the Oberoi Hotel for swimming where the undertow is a little less than elsewhere. There is some litter on the beach (but they clean outside the larger hotels incl the Oberoi) so those spots are cleaner and remember the sand is dark - but don't be put off. It's also great for a morning or afternoon walk. Hawkers are few and far between and the few that are there are not pushy."
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Beautiful beach in Seminyak Bali, it's in between Kuta and petitenget beach and it's just perfect to chill here."
DanielC,16 contributions,Nov 2015,"We liked this beach. We hired an instructor to teach us surfing. You can chose from local instructors or schools (lot of options). Waves were quite big, excellent for surfing. "
Anjusg,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,Seminyak beach was bit let down. Nice beach but could be cleaner. Though it was buzzing with nightlife and activitities and it was enjoyable to soak in the atmosphere. The sea was beautiful but you have to watch when you walk for waste on the beach. 
rodrigoelp,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Some of our first days in Bali and decided to take a walk to the nearest beach from our hotel, eventually made our way through several streets into the beach but not before having our bags checked by police, that was something quite bizarre until my partner explained to me that Bali has changed quite a lot since the terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2005.In any case, walked into the beach just to notice a sea of rubbish being washed ashore. Told my missus I wanted to take a swim but as I was getting closer four plastic bags discouraged my attempt to which we started to walk along the beach. If you happen to walk close to any hotel/pub/bar you will see a little more variation on the type of rubbish, ranging from bottles and smoke buds to condoms (I was lucky enough to just find the aluminium packaging.)Getting close to The Oberoi hotel (or whatever it was) no less than 6 people were laying on the beach under clear influence of way too much booze, two of them screaming obscenities to people walking around. Another couple under a similar situation minus the obscenities after that hotel and a lot more towards the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa... we arrived at the beach around 4:30pm so all this probably happened between 4:30pm to 6pm?We end up going back to the hotel and crashing by the pool.I got no idea if Bali has become some kind of tourism dumpster in which people comes here to release any kind of inhibition while locals consent any behaviour in exchange of a constant stream of money from their wallets... at least in Seminyak."
Frankview,Singapore,Dec 2015,The waves are very strong in Seminyak and hence time in the ocean would be limited. However the view of the strong waves lashing Seminyak is one of the best in Bali and that in itself demands a visit.
filippos p,"Athens, Greece",Dec 2015,Nice beach with every you need...very good for me because of the serfing possibility. . We have of course in greece very beautiful beaches but not these special waves. ...
Joycedos,"Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",Dec 2015,Unfortunately this beach is dirty. We had a stroll along beach not very pleasant dog walkers let dogs mess on beach and don't pick up. 
MissRoxy17,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"the beach has too much litter and its not really a safe swimming beach. the sand is that blackish sand, maybe i'm just spoilt by living in WA! Went to Nusa Dua last year and the beaches are  better there. "
Devine P,"Bac Ninh, Vietnam",Jul 2015,"My family chose Seminyak beach as our main overnight place during our trip to Indonesia according to my friends' recommendation. The choice was right absolutely. The beach was clean, wide sandy beach with diversified services and beach entertaiment that we enjoyed. Stayed in W retreat resort by the beach front and we were really happy. The beach has not much tourists as other beaches in SE Asia we've stayed."
Trevor K,"South Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"I'm sure most travellers to Bali must be shocked at the current state of the main beaches.  Both Seminyak and Legian beaches were covered with trash, both in and out of the water - so much so that we avoided these beaches.The exception is the space in front of some of the major hotels, presumably they employ people to clean them.Hard to fathom why the local authorities haven't addressed this issue, it is a major blight on Bali. Would recommend heading out to Batu Bolong for your beach / surf fix, it is almost pristine."
Amar N,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,We stayed at a hotel overlooking Seminyak beach and loved it!!There were enough waves for some amateur surfing and body boarding but not too big to stop any kids from being able to play in the water.Long beautiful beach stretch also made it great for a morning run.
SedaEg,Istanbul,Aug 2015,"Out of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak; Seminyak is the one with access to high-end beach clubs and hotels. However, Legian is better situated, waves are both for surfing and playing in water. There are more beach side warrungs and more sunbeds. Seminyak isn't bad either as long as you are chilling at one of the beach clubs."
Macpheejil,"Madrid, Spain",Dec 2015,"Been there, enjoyed the moment, nearly been blown away by the strong wind as we were there during the raining season.  However, found that many of the other tourist do enjoy surfing..."
MarTravels16,"Redhill, UK",Dec 2015,"A nice beach lined with lots of wonderful bars and restaurants. Be careful when walking on the 'promenade' as bikes happily rush past you. Littering does appear to be a slight problem however the view does compensate for this. Visit if you are close by, but save the travel from elsewhere."
Navneet04,72 contributions,Dec 2015,"If you're travelling from another Bali just to visit this beach, then it's not worth it. Kuta Beach would be better. Lots of trash on Seminyak Beach and it's not really swim-able either."
Em Engel,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"Hired some comfortable beach chairs, slathered on some factor 30 and spent a beautiful day on Seminyak beach. It's not a great beach for swimming, but the water is pleasant for a quick dip."
ceeceedeeuk,ceeceedeeuk,Dec 2015,"This beach is ruined by the huge amount of rubbish on the shore. It makes it completely unappealing for swimming. This is something that needs to be addressed on a major scale. With no central rubbish collection, locals throw items into rivers and it ultimately washes up on Seminyak (and other) beaches. My view is probably marred by the pristine Australian beaches i'm used to, but I'd avoid this spot. it was really pretty gross."
Cindy O,"Makassar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,I thinks this beach is New Kuta Beach. We spent 15-20 minutes ride motorbike from Legian to Seminyak. Enjoying sunset on this beach is very great experience. 
frances b,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,"The very ew is quite amazing, don't always buy food at the restaurants along the beach go for a walk and get some of the tasty cobs of corn cooked by the vendors it is very tasty and cheap."
Thorpie77,87 contributions,Dec 2015,I have a preference for clean beaches - shame so much rubbish on these beaches. Good place to watch sunset - get a little tired of saying no thanks constantly for massages etc...
vickyvic,36 contributions,Dec 2015,I like seminyak beach better than kuta beach. Better view to watch sunset and not messy. In the context of messy crowd (beach boys with their rental boards and selling beers). Not white sand though.Written by : aventuracognitio.wordpress.com
TerenceSingapore,Singapore,Dec 2015,"I like this beach not just because it's extremely  central and accessible, but because it has character and life. Compared with the overly commercial Kuta Beach, it has a better vibe. Even though there are many hotels, resorts, beach clubs, along the stretch of beach, especially from the Double Six to the Dhyana Pura areas, the beach still offers a waterside stretch that's great for photo taking, watching dogs (and horses) frollick in the sand, flying kites, or just strolling along the water's edge. Sunset is of course the favourite time of the day to lounge on one of the beanbag chairs provided by the beach clubs."
David P,"Austin, TX",Dec 2015,"Restaurants and more restaurants and then  some - definitely for the younger generations- unless you like loud music, some crowds and average food. Close to a number of hotels so it is convenient for all. "
gaurav0811,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,Beach is clean and there are many good cafes on the beach where one can enjoy the food and drinks. Cafes on the beach are open till mid night and one can have a good sunset view. 
tofanoink,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"one of famous beach in bali, and there's so many famous cafe sorounding. you can see beautiful sunset here while enjoying snacks and beer :)"
Shobhit B,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,"this is a beautiful beach, with great crowd around. there are a bunch of bars playing good music. A walk in the evening could be very romantic! "
lovetravelslove,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2015,"Hubbi and I knew we can't lounge for long at the beach...so we only wanted the beach chairs and umbrellas for a couple of hours and we were upfront about the short stay...still, we probably discussed with six different vendors and everyone of them was charging USD10 or more for the few hours we wanted to stay, crazy!!!We ended up sitting at one and got our price down to USD 8 per chair...for a bit over 2 hours we stayed :(Bali is so over-rated with tourists, it's often frustrating for travelers."
Sedek87,26 contributions,Sep 2015,Try look at private beach due it less crowded. Open beach is bit pack with people and slightly not secure.
Purrplehaze,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,Sunset by the beach was amazing from these two locations. Its a must visit destination for every traveler looking for a fabulous beachy time
thataussiecouple,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Seminyak Beach is nice, however it does not live up to the standards of beaches back in Australia. I come from a part of Australia with beautiful white sand any clean beaches, therefore it is hard to enjoy anywhere that's not like that. The sand looks a dirty colour, and there can be a lot of rubbish on the beach. On the plus side, the water is a beautiful temperature and you can get some nice surfing waves (although it is definitely a beach that your have to swim between the flags)"
Selena39,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2015,"Nice beach for afternoon drinks or food. Definitely not the golden sands of our Australian beaches, but great for a refreshing dip with the added character of beach bars. The street hawkers are there but very polite and no hard sell. Beautiful sunsets."
linda l,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,Bean bags etc. are set up so you can watch the sunset. You can also buy drinks..you will be bombarded with people trying to sell you things
Tim W,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Not white sand like Nusa Dua but a good beach, not crowded, and with plenty of bars and cafes nearby"
Arlene Y,"Drayton Valley, Canada",Dec 2015,"Loved this beach. Beautiful white sand, and there were lots of people surfing. Could rent surf boards nearby. "
Ryw Surf Lesson B,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"We do Surf Lesson for beginners, Surfing Instructor will explan for instruction and help the beginner surfer to catch the wave and padle to stand up on the surf board and we will take photos of beginner surfer when they stand up and ride them waves on the surfboard.. Duration 1 hour and 2 hours."
FleecySqueezyFizzy,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"Perfect getaway from your busy work routine, I'm referring to Singaporean. Quiet, very calm and it helps to relief stress. "
Travelmore1261,Sunshine Coast Australia,Dec 2015,"Good clean beach with good surf on the doorstep of Seminyak. Tasty bars and cafe which supply beanbags if you buy a drink or food. Hawkers are good natured and no too aggressive ( just be polite, they're trying to make a living too) easy to hire surf or bogey boards and rips are ok. Clean water unlike Kuta. "
Ashley H,"Bideford, UK",Dec 2015,"Nice beach, lots of different bars and places to eat all the way along. Very good surf if that's your thing. Big waves a lot of the time. Can become pretty annoying getting pestered by the locals all the time. They are always trying to sell you stuff. Also if you want to lie on a sunbed you have to pay. But don't be afraid to haggle, there are so many people trying to get you on their sunbed so if they say a price that's too high then just go to the next man. Once you do have a sunbed then the guys running it are happy to bring you beers or whatever you want really. "
aview2akill,"Seattle, WA",Dec 2015,The beach in Seminyak is good and the water is very clean.  The water is not super blue and the sand is not white so don't expect Hawaii or Bermuda.  But fun safe beach with many cool places to grab a drink to watch the sunset from. 
Micheal E,"Cairo, Egypt",Dec 2015,"there is a lot of beach clubs you can go to. The beach is not so amazing to chill on the beach, you have a lot better options. its good for some surfers"
ong_giri,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"place to relax on the beach or just walk along the beach, or get wet in water  or take surfing lesson there"
Jane1808,"Whyalla, Australia",Nov 2015,a nice clean beach that stretched for miles! Surfing lessons were available and in the evening dining and entertainment was available.  sitting on bean bags listening to live music throughout the evening is very popular 
Taffoolie,"Paris, France",Dec 2015,"The beach is clean and so nice. You can walk for a long time, the beach is wide and long.water is beautiful and sunset is breathtaking here. "
Sean T,"Canberra, Australia",Dec 2015,"The beach itself is not great, there are better beaches to visit. Pretty overrated. The only saving grace is the number of clubs such as potato head. They are amazing."
Linsie C,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,Nice beach n beautiful view. Not many people and good for relax. Closed from my hotel just walk around 5 minutes. Love to came back  here next time with my family.
A2535ATjohnw,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Nice clean beach. Kids loved it. Plenty of vendors for food and drinks. Locals will try to sell you stuff, so be wary."
joliefolie,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2015,"Dip your feet in the creamiest golden sand as you watch tiny crabs immerse from the doughy, wet sand. Great area for beach lounging, sun tanning, people watching and walking."
Debbie L,"Dallas, Texas",Nov 2015,Definitely not what I expected especially from all the hype. Beach and sea water seemed rather dirty and it was too crowded with vendors.
Kirsttreth,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"So much happening here. Great waves, nice clean sand, surfing, horseback riding, kite flying, cool bars and eateries. "
RGH8800,"Seattle, WA",Dec 2015,"I was surprised that this beach was fairly clean. At first glance I thought OMG it looks like Patong Beach in Phuket Thailand, but boy was I wrong. The beach was fairly clean, but because the sand was not white at first the water seemed dirty but when you get in you can see your feet from 5 feet in the water. We enjoyed swimming in the cool refreshing water and getting drinks from the beach bars that litter the beach. "
Dyah K,3 contributions,Nov 2015,Go in low season the beach is not that packed..u can get beautiful sunset scenery..ur kids can play in clean sand and catch the wave..a lots of beach club around if u want to sit back and relax.or just bring your own beach blanket(if u want to pay 100.000idr u can rent a beach chair).
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great day to visit Seminyak Beach, hot , small swell, lifeguard and hawkers on point duty. Boogie boards and surfboards available for hire (not much rental income from these today)."
Sandra S,"Edge Hill, Australia",Nov 2015,There was a lot of rubish on the beach and I saw some small creeks which looked like they are carrying sewage.
Indra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"This place the second beach that i loved after Uluwatu beach area. If you are in the city i recommended this place to sit, relax and enjoy the sunset in this beach. All kind of activities that you can see around this area, also if you want to find good restaurants along the Seminyak street. Nice place to spend for the sunset time! "
Batchy94,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2015,"A very beautiful beach and especially beautiful at sunset, worth going down to watch the sunset a couple of people trying to sell things on the beach but that's Bali. Worth taking time to go have a look at !"
Dolores S,Mauritius,Nov 2015,"Not sure about the swimming here, the swell was pretty high but nice easy surfing. I walked all the way to Kuta Beach, great views of the bay and nobody to disturb you. Great for jogging as well!"
Vinaya S,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2015,All kinds of beach activities are available here and the scenery is awesome especially when the weather gets cloudy! We had a great time.
Chris K,"Beirut, Lebanon",Dec 2015,"Beautiful beach but very high waves for a swim unless your a surfer.Regarding the sunset, its phenomenal !!"
Adam J,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2015,Great wide beach for strolling swimming or tanning. Dark sand with rough waters. Lots of action and will be an up and coming beach in Bali in the years to come. Invest in it now before it grows!
kerrys474,Burton,Dec 2015,"Watching the sunset on beach bean bags with live music, drinking Bintang and cocktails with great company and great service. Perfect. Awesome atmosphere."
sjbrady_jb,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2015,This is a mustTo wander down onto the beach at seminyak grab a spot at any one of a number of different bars on the beach listen to music add a cold beer and some quality snacks and you are in business one of life's wonderful multi cultural experiencesRecommend as a rite of passage
chellemaree88,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,"Stay at your resort pool!This beach has dangerous currents and is filthy! Do yourself a favour, stay at your hotel pool! "
iainadamson,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2015,a beach is a beach is a beach   plenty of beds to hire   plenty of people selling hats drinks snacks  plenty of places to learn to surf  very good hotels in the area 
June H,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2015,Stayed at Double six with an ocean view which we never tire of.  From people watching in the morning to the brilliant sunsets at night it is just heaven.  We love it.  Also sunset drinks on the beach is an amazing experience.
saverioca,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"Semyniak beach is one of the most wonderful place for surfers and young people as well, nevertheless you could find some parts where Bali is still have the  old style feeling with part of the jungle mixed with alang alang roofs.Specially the part in front of Oberoi Hotel where the nature is really protagonist and elegant garden landscape make you happy to walk on the beach...amazing!"
guptadrravi,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2015,The beach is not as good as the other breaches in Bali.. seems a bit dirty although flooded with people.. the croud is great and there are quite a lot of clubs surrounding this area.. not a beach where one can take a dip.. more of a sight seeing place
Rimi22,"London, UK",Aug 2015,You get the best views of the sunset on this beach! Never have we seen such a beautiful sunset and sunrise! 
lalith1,"Panjim, India",Nov 2015,Can be reached on foot from seminyak square in 10 mins. Good for swimming as the water is not rough or choppy.Quite and good for viewing sunset
Bonny_Febrialdy,Jakarta,Nov 2015,"Nice place for family with calm waves, not many peoples around, not to hot due to many coconut trees and easy to access."
Paul,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"Although a little packed at dusk, there's some great eateries further north of W Resort where you can lie down and watch the sunset on a sun bed. Certainly less traversed than further south at the likes of Double Six and also less hawkers. Check it out for a sunset or 5."
pelpinda_nl,"Zevenhuizen, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,Very nice beach with a lot of restaurants. I found the quality of the restaurants at the beach very poor. But it is very nice to watch the sunset on a beanbag. 
Al2go,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,The beach was filthy but at least they don't hassle you.  rubbish and what looked like a sewage film with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem. I know that we as tourists have a responsibility to do what we can and I hope that most of us do.  we don't think we will come back to Bali.
Scott M,16 contributions,Nov 2015,Been down a few times this recent trip to bali. (Both at night and day)Can be very pretty particularly at sunset.Bit of a shame how dirty and polluted it is.Plenty of eateries and stalls selling bintang.Will probably go back again.Certainly would NOT go swimming here however.
Kris W,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2015,"Relaxing day swimming in the beach and tanning on the sun chairs, lots of inexpensive beach cafes to have a nice lunch "
Matthew J,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,WOrth the sunset.. have some beers people! cheers! also do take a walk along the beach and enjoy the warm backwash of the sea.. CHeers! 
caty00197,"Tallinn, Estonia",Nov 2015,"The beach is nice, mostly waves are too big for swimming. On sunset the beach is very popular and most bar on the beach have chill atmosphere and live music."
lanie f,Philippines,Oct 2015,It‚Äôs peculiar to see offerings and some Hindu rituals happening on its long stretch where elegant resorts are present. While walking to look for cheap and good resto we even witnessed two live ducks being tossed into the sea along with some fruits for offering. The poor ducks got broken necks instantly because of the strong waves.
lenny s,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"i love the seminyak beach...the sands...the colourful places for us to sit and relax while watching the sunset...seeing people playing, surfing...wonderful"
Katwildo,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,"Delicious selections.  Quite busy.  Reasonable prices.  Squid ink calamari pasta yummy, but portion a little mean.  "
KAMERM,"London, UK",Nov 2015,"Not too much hassling by sellers. Beds can be bartered for, then you are left in peace. Lovely San and a good swell in the sea, good for bodyboarding, surfing, not that I would do either but others were."
Eddie W,3 contributions,Nov 2015,We went on off season so the beach was nearly empty except the crowds in the Potato Head Club.There were heaps of offerings on the beach so pay attention to them.The beach has weird smell so you might no want to jump in the water.
manonspot,larkhall,Nov 2015,"Seminyak beach unlike Other nearby beaches have beds for hire most of the way down the beach which you can hire by the hour,most people come down around lunch time where you can have a nice meal at the beach bars.After a drink or meal you can lie on beds until sun goes down by which time more people arrive to watch this lovely spectacle ,this is a truly amazing sight.After sun disappears (6-30-7-00pm November,) people retreat to the bean bags set up on the sand outside the bars.The staff set up a makeshift stage and a band starts playing on the beach,you just lay back and soak in the atmosphere,brilliant."
Carine P,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,"well, personally i prefer seminyak than kuta beach, less people, less tourists, less crowded. the water isn't clear blue like nusa lembong or gigi islands but still its a nice place to come, sit, relax and enjoy the day."
Dhruva34,"Noida, India",Oct 2015,This was the first time my son was on a beach since he turned one. He had an absolute blast playing with the sand (probably ate quite a bit) and i had a great time jogging along the beach. crowd was well behaved and the sunsets were gorgeous.
Carla M,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"We visited Seminyak beach on a number of occasions over 12 days. We took our children who are 7, 5 and 3 years old respectively. Great place for familes. The surf can get rough but safe-to-swim areas are flagged. The surf is great for learning how to body surf which our older children did. A really friendly place, we met lots of other families by the beach and it was easy to strike up conversations. We had a sunset dinner one night. Yes, it was expensive but it was entirely worth it to watch the sunset, drink in hand, delicious food close by, lounging on a bean bag. Loved it and the so did the kids. The water is warm. The kids adored swimming until it was dark.  The sellers can be a bit full on. If you make eye-contact, watch out! Generally though once we said 'no thanks' we were left in peace. Bargain for the sun lounges. On our first day we paid 100,000 rupiah for one hour, by our last day we were getting the same lounge for 50,000 rupish for two hours!! "
JB0642015,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"A must-see if you are in Bali. The restaurants along this beach are cheap and delicious, incredibly talented singers woo you as the sun goes down. Sipping on cocktails under brightly coloured umbrellas and fairy-lights is just perfect! "
EdmundEmmanuel,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2015,"Average beach; don't expect white sandy blue beach... Limited activities, only surfing, not allowed to swim there due to the waves... Walking a distance and you can see sewer-like water flowing towards the beach from the resorts. EWWW... On a side note, definitely nice for a sunrise/sunset stroll, but that's just about it."
chirag g,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2015,if you want you can avoid seminyak beack as its not that great. south bali beaches are better and if you wanna party then pls goto kuta..
Glenndavid62,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,"This beach is clean, surfers seem to like this area. Food and surfing lessons are available. At sunset it is the place to go, sit on the beanbags, listen to music, have a cocktail and watch the sunset."
Pierre D,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,"Our third  (and last) week at Seminyak Beach.Concluding: the beach is wonderful; but the (beach)restaurants here serve abstemious/average food; and certainly not cheap!But: you're on the beach: the sound of the waves, and so on.....that compensates a lot, you expect (and hope).But no: each beachrestaurant has its own stage with a very loud band playing. And of course you can discuss about music taste; but you cannot discuss about the volume of the music: you can hardly talk when they are playing   Every restaurant feels the urge to leave (like a dog) a smellflag.Our conclusion: spend your day at Seminyak Beach and for dinner: find a restaurant near Seminyak Square: several restaurants serve very good food (find them at TripAdvisor!!!). The price is often more than right and the music never dominates the atmosphere"
Romit N,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,Spent half a day lazing around the beach with the occasional dip in the water. Peaceful atmosphere and saw several local smiles. Would highly recommend coming here.
jatinjain155,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2015,This was the best among all the beaches I have seen in Bali. One of the most beautiful places to be at sunset. Highly recommend to visit at sunrise or sunset. Many clubs and restaurants along the beach. Most of the people leave the beach after sunset. Went there at 8 at night and saw the beach empty.
Catherine A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"large, spread out beaches makes it great for sunbathing (if not interrupted by the locals)..it is a glistening beach with darkish sand and not so crystal clear water. The waves roll and roll and it is pretty dangerous for new swimmers. Everything is ridiculously over priced and can be bargained down to 90%.There are lots of families with young kids and cute dogs running around on leashes which makes it a nice, friendly beach."
Argenine,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2015,Though the beach gets slightly more crowded at sunset the water is shallow and you can just walk right in and swim for quite a distance. It is better than the kuta beach as there are less surfers and this beach is more about swimming and relaxing. 
Davey Y,Tokyo,Aug 2015,"I was shocked there were so few people on this stretch of beach! Everyone seemed to crowd down around Kuta, but up in Seminyak we had so much room to ourselves."
carolbali,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2015,This area has got terrific atmosphere even at early morning.The locals are so friendly and they dont push for you to buy.Not like Kuta beach.The bars along the beach offer great value for money.Food and drink are all great value Always good for a laugh!
lostdipika,Wisconsin,Aug 2015,"Better one. Better than Kuta and Legian. Seminyak is the house to many luxury and top end hotels and restaurants, I heard people swear by the night life. We found the beach bit cleaner than the other 2 Kuta and Liegian and this was one fantastic part around. Loved the roadside pubs and bars on the other side, surely a tourists paradise."
Vishu_Agarwal,India,Nov 2015,Went in morning. Beach has great waves and look really beautiful and calm. Doesnt have many shops and things to do but if you are looking for peaceful time on beach Seminyak can be one of them. 
Ling30,KL,Nov 2015,"Nice beach beach, with flag indicators from the many beach front hotel for surfing. Typical powerful wave good for surfing, not for swimmers. Facing west, thus can see nice sunsets in the evening, and on the other side, it is decorated with all lightings from beach restaurants. Many locals selling goods or surfing lesson etc, very much overpriced, and can usually reduced by half when you walk away. So the price requested is not tally with product or quality. There are some section of the beach which are public, others are sorted with bean bags and sun bed for rent belong to some operators, you just need to pick any one you like, and they will approach with price.Many restaurants, colorfully decorated along the beach road, only very few bicycle riders, and the rental is much more expensive than Sanur beach. Sanur beach is equally nice, and much more quite. Seller there also quotes more sensible price for goods."
Aisha214,New York,Sep 2015,"This beach remains too crowded, and is a dirty one compared to other beaches in Bali. Hence it is good only to view the lovely view of the sunset.There are a lot of people playing volleyball on the beach, some budding sand artists, lots of hawkers and a number of options to eat and drink. This place is good for water sports."
Evan B,"Diamond Creek, Australia",Nov 2015,You must go and watch the sunsets. If on a budget sit on the plastic chairs v the beanbags and umbrellas
Jan s,"Traralgon, Australia",Nov 2015,"We hired two over-priced sunbeds and proceeded to play in the waves with the kids. Once the hawkers walking our piece of beach had tried a couple of times, and been rebuffed, we could actually settle in, relax and enjoy ourselves. Lots of cigarette butts on the beach but otherwise it seemed fairly clean and it made a nice change from our hotel pool."
Gary K,"Toowoomba, Australia",Aug 2015,The beach itself was ok at the waters edge. There were some dirty drains and small creeks flowing onto the Beach at various points carrying rubbish with them which takes away from the experience. It was nice to be able to sit at a bar or restaurant along the back of the beach and enjoy a cold drink or meal at sunset. 
Jellymaren,"Leiden, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,"I've been told Seminyak is way more quiet than Kuta. The beach has got another vibe, with a lot of colorful beach bars, but it's still quite busy. Prices are the same as in Kuta. Lovely place to hang out and watch the sunset, solo or with whoever you want üôè."
sash0131,Massachusetts,Oct 2015,"Very next to the 'W' and many other hotels (including Legian Bali) along its length.  We enjoyed the pleasant walk along the beach.  If you find a hotel along this beach, the sunsets will be enjoyable and likely to be visible from your ocean view room itself - but on the beach it will be much more fun..."
Adsandme,31 contributions,Nov 2015,Better and quitter beach to chill at.. Sun beds over priced!!! Sand very hot so be careful and wear decent footwear!! Be prepared to get hassled a lot!! 
Greg C,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,"Not a bad beach, not bad surf, but there are loads of beaches in the world like that. Nice sunsets, but hawkers abound! Do not buy anything here - VERY overpriced, no matter what you haggle down to. Go to Ubud or beyond for that. Nice place to get some food or a drink, but is priced accordingly."
Marcel dB,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"Stayed on the beach to enjoy the sunset with some juice and simple snacks. Juice was rich in taste, not too sweet. The 3 bnacks a little boring. The view was beautiful and I think that is what you pay for."
Pete_fm_Oz,"Darwin, Australia",Nov 2015,An afternoon in Bali is not complete without a relaxing drink on the beach.Seminyak beach has a number of warungs Resto and bars along the beach between double six and Jl Arjuna. Be prepared to be assaulted by the beach vendors plying there wares. But they are respectful if you just say no. so be it a Bintang or a cocktail the sunset is best viewed from a comfy beanbag chair on the sand above the high water markEnjoy !!
Pliszek,"Warsaw, Poland",Nov 2015,"As stated above, this is the longest and widest beach I've been to - but what I've mostly liked is the myriad of restaurants and bars along the Seminyak-Legian section of the beach - some to recommend, such as Champlung, with great after-sunset live music :-)"
Ayshe I,"Muscat, Oman",Oct 2015,"This is a beautiful beach, which is kept clean and not too crowded. Watching the sunset from the beach was beautiful, and the restaurants along the beach front set-up lounging areas and some even have live music so you can enjoy the beach in the evenings. "
GGIO10,"Chicago, IL",Oct 2015,"Nice beach, but you can't go more than 1 minutes without someone trying to sell you something and sell you hard on it. They basically harass you non stop. "
Qball_351,"Pearcedale, Australia",Nov 2015,We spent a few days here in our travels. With everything from amazing eateries fun water sports and beautiful sunsets this is a must see and play please while in Bali 
BeachObsessed73,"Calgary, Canada",Oct 2015,I spent an afternoon at Seminyak Beach body surfing and it was so much fun.  The waves are big but it didn't feel dangerous.  No undertow.  There were a few surfers in the evening but they mainly came out the next morning.  Very nice long beach for walking.  Great spot to watch the sunset.
travellove91,"London, UK",Oct 2015,"Lovely beach with beautiful sand and lovely clear waters. I visited this beach in October 2015 and every day was sunny with lots of people around-not too busy however! Beach loungers are not too expensive we paid 100,000 rupiahs for 2 beds. There are a few sales people selling various knick-knacks but not as much hassle as some other places I have been to. This is a long stretch of beach that connects to Kuta beach. Would definitely recommend this beach if youre staying in seminyak!"
beysie,"Barcelona, Spain",Sep 2015,"Although the beach has some treasures as ""La Plancha"" beachclub to go at sunset, the beach isn't really nice for sunbathing. It was dirty and noisy. Not nice as may be beaches at the peninsula. "
Sandy T,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,"Go early to beat the heat, but extremely pleasant. Worthwhile and great for working out your bearings. "
JamesHAfrica,"Arusha, Tanzania",Oct 2015,"Best enjoyed early morning and late evening, with friends and a cocktail in hand, an Asian margarita for example. "
Stefan R,"Munich, Germany",Oct 2015,"Its really nice to relax in one of the many bars there and watch the beautiful sundown. Many of them habe beanbags in the sand. Best time is from 90 Minutes before official sundown. Only downturn are the sellers that constantly ask you if you want to buy something like wtches, sunglasses, art and many more."
vishwajitgaikwad,"Hyderabad, India",Feb 2015,"Depending on the time of your visit, this place offers varying experiences. It is very clean most of the months but during the winter months, the tide brings back all the plastic waste on the beach. A good place to laze around, get a cheap but wonderful foot massage and get entertained by numerous hawkers around"
Jom B,23 contributions,Oct 2015,"One of the best sunset in bali another kuta beach, near by seminyak central, petitenget temple, and alot people come to see the beautiful sunset and white sand"
Beth V,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2015,"The water was clear, the beach and sand was clean. However, having been spoiled by West Australian and Queensland beaches, it was hard to rate this in the same category. However, there were lots of beachgoers making the most of the beach and thoroughly enjoying themselves"
HpBrenn,"Trinity Beach, Australia",Oct 2015,"Seminyak beach has less hustle and bushel then Kuta. Same black volcanic sand but a bit more rubbish as there are not so many Hotel, so less cleaning done. Dirty creeks run straight in to the sea, so i did not bother to have a swim. It's good for a cheap sun set, if you don't mind no bands playing and you bring your own drinks. "
Joe H,"Jerrabomberra, Australia",Oct 2015,Very very pretty at sunset and at night but during day just not that greatRubbish on beach which was disappointing Rips like nobody's business and tonnes of idiots swimming in there !Constant hagglers too who were pretty damn persistentStick to pool until 4 pm!
Miranda B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,The beach up this end is much nicer that the Kuta/Legian end it seems to be cleaner around the nice resorts.   
beaulife,Ubud,Oct 2015,"I am living withing walking distance to this pure beauty. Sunset at any given day is always a fun-filling one, either for sunset run, power walk, or lazily siting with a drink."
JML,2 contributions,Oct 2015,We came here and found a great little Bar called La Plancha. Could have stayed here for hours!! Amazing beach and such great atmosphere. 
Espressogal,"Orange, Australia",Oct 2015,"Dead flat, mid sized waves, super sunsets and a choice of reclining lounges or bean bags. It's difficult for an Australian to review a beach and go wow! Definitely not the reason your would come to Bali."
Jan A T,"Hawley, PA",Oct 2015,"A beautiful beach for a sunset walk before dinner at one of the nearby restaurants, like La Lucciola! Not crowded in the evenings, easy access, easy parking, stunning views."
Karyadi S,"Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Nice beach for learning surving and g√≤od for take the family walking to the beach..also many good beach reataurant sorrounding
Nicholas B,pennyroyal,Oct 2015,Such a shame but the increase in rubbish and nearby creeks that are best described as open drains are a blight on what was once a delight
Judy W,"Greater Manchester, UK",Oct 2015,"The beach is not as nice as I originally thought, though it is clean enough and quiet. Sadly, it covers with lots of volcanic sand which has made it less attractive. "
Kim S,19 contributions,Oct 2015,We walked along the beach after breakfast there were other couples happily walking along which was lovely to see. I loved the sea mist but the sand was so hot with no shoes eek! Awesome waves go check it out.
Sheila J,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2015,The people are welcoming and wonderful and the beaches are absolutely gorgeous.. I rented a private villa within walking distance and was nice taking in the sites on our walk to the beach.. 
janicemareegreen2604,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,The beach was fantastic and watching the sunrise along the beach was beatutiful. Many people fly kites on the beach to and there is easy access through many of the well known restaurants like the potato head restaurant.
seemo_x,"Yanbu, Saudi Arabia",May 2015,"if you like the clean and wonderful sunshine you must come to seminyak beach, t's less crowded than kuta beach, there are many restaurants there. and this place has a lot tourists."
Stew147,"Winchester, UK",Nov 2014,Such a great place to chill. Nice bars and restaurants around to eat. Plenty of loungers to have a nice beer too. The best sunsets you could possibly see
Scott S,"Gawler, Australia",Oct 2015,Beatiful swimming beach fantastic for sunsets. We loved the cheap beach warongs that served basic cheap eats and cheap beer. You can hire a beach chair for $5 all day and they bring out the bean bags after sunset. Much cleaner than Kuta Beach.
Micky M,Singapore,Oct 2015,We watched the sunset from the beach and it was beautiful. The fine soft sand just makes you so wanna play with it. 
vivianmibi,"New York City, New York",Oct 2015,"Though low season, it was a large beach, quiet, perfect for just relaxing under the sun! There are a few restaurants nearby and you can rent a beach chair for a pretty good price if needed. The sand here - amazing. "
geelongexpat,"Chatan-cho, Japan",Oct 2015,"I cruised down here to watch the sunset the last 2 nights. There is plenty of room for everyone. The surfers, the swimmers, the tanners, the drinkers and even the dogs. The beach itself has more of a brown sand, but it is not rocky and very flat. You'll be surprised at how close some of the waves get to you. There are a couple of very trendy bars here as well to sip cocktails in. Definitely worth a visit."
globetrotting4life,london,Oct 2015,"Beautiful, white-sand beach, clean, with great atmosphere especially at night with good restaurants and live music. Very romantic especially at night."
Laurence777_12,Wellington,Oct 2015,"Thoroughly recommend a lazy afternoon and evening whiling away the time slouched on a beanbag at one of Seminyak beach bars. Any will do, they're all the same pretty much - just choose the one with tunes you can tolerate and plonk yourself down.  The service is efficient and friendly, the food comforting and delicious, and the Bintang washes it down smoothly. What more could you ask? Oh, and then there's those sunsets...magic."
Liam S,"Geelong, Australia",Oct 2015,We went to Seminyak beach a few times during our stay in Seminyak. It is a nice beach for sunsets. When it gets dark the atmosphere on the beach is great. Only downside is the waves are extremely strong. 
shashamurai,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Walking distance frm Seminyak Square. But we unsure of the exact shortcuts to the beach. So we had our long way walk till we found Ku De Ta restaurant, But we didnt enter from here as there is security check to enter the restaurant. So we just walk ahead and found ourself nearly at the end before reaching to 'Legian Bali' . So we guessed that we have made the wrong moves by not always asking for direction. Choices of turn right or left facing beach . We decided to turn left and walk few miles before reaching seminyak beach (this time round, we made e right choice.) Seminyak beach , full of tourist and lots of restaurant, noisy but really njoyed, surfers, eyecathing on horse riding pass u and there will be people approaching to u that can make hair braiding. Nicely doNe!! We end our day there by ordering cocktail and walk back to Ku De Ta restaurant and ask the security if we can exit here. He smile and say yes.. "
JadeEPreCious,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Beach is small, a bit dirty and with super hot sands. Nevertheless, the beach is pretty with great seaview."
Daphne T,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,"love this part of the beach in Bali has so much to offer in the way of caf√©/bars music all day and people watching a great place to spend the day swimming, surfing or just hanging out"
Satrajit R,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Pretty sad & boring beach. Went for sunrise but looks of the beach was disappointing. Taking a bath is also not allowed.
rsandsT1,"Camrose, Canada",Sep 2015,"Seminyak Beach has it all sun, surf, sand, people, restaurants for every taste, live entertainment and if that has not fulfilled your day sit back at the end of it and enjoy the beautiful sunset."
Lyn O,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,"Great overnight stay. Very clean rooms, comfy bed. Great variety for breakfast. Pool was very clean as well"
Princezna A,"Roztoky, Czech Republic",Oct 2015,"Beaches are full of people which is good, but people make more and more mess and nobody cleans it. The garbage bin are only anywhere. So instead of  beautiful view you can see just plastic garbage on the beach. What is the worst,  no one can see it."
Greg P,"Victoria Park, Australia",Oct 2015,"Beautiful sunset and view. an easy stroll from the Dusun Villa, approx 500m leisurely walk. Then stop at Mexicolla for a quick drink and eat"
Ristiyatikho A,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"I back here again and again.  Enjoying the sunburn at 9 am till 5 pm.  Take lunch here, many cafe around.  Then waiting the sunset.  The cafe start preparation, put table and chair for visitors at the beach.  Enjoying long island and beer before dinner, meanwhile the sun start hiding, flashing the tinge blushing the sky"
Louinsydney,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,Nice large beach.. it was clean in front of our hotel but not so much further along the beach. Nice spot to go for a run before it gets too hot.
ScambusterSZ,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,Definitely go to the beach for Sunset Drinks. The few 'Bean Bag' Beach clubs are great and the food is surprisingly good (go 'right' along from The Cocoon resort) . The sunset is amazing and the new Railler Bintang will please most people (new Lemon flavoured beer = Shandy in a bottle)
SriDevi2103,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Loved this beach, lovely sunset and amazing beach bars! Clean beach. Watched one of the most amazing sunsets here!"
Andrew T,31 contributions,Oct 2015,"The sunset is very nice, but by Australian standards the beach sucks.Lots of cigarette butts to dodge and human sewage running off the hotels into the ocean."
Steve R,4 contributions,Oct 2015,Loved the beach - rented beach chairs from the locals.  who were very attentive.  Always there to bring you beers or coconut drinks
MatthewTheCatthew,"Fukuyama, Japan",Oct 2015,"There's just no other sunset like it on earth. The huge red perfectly circular orb, slowly descending into the endless horizon is romantic, breathtaking and truly spectacular. The beach offers plenty of beanbag restaurants to kick back, sip a Bintang and take in this truly awe inspiring spectacle with the ones you love. The redness of the dying light is otherworldly, ethereal and awakens light in even the hardest of hearts."
Leontko,Singapore,Oct 2015,"Right beside it's sister beach at legain, Seminyak is the less crowded of the two. However, they are both pretty similar in terms of what they have to offer. Surf and drink vendors line the beach offering surf lessons and board rental. Salesmen of sunglasses and henna artists will also offer their wares and services to you. If you love to surf, the place here is pretty great. However, be warned that they can be quite strong for a beginner surfer, so don't go too far out! In fact, if you are a beginner, it might be better to surf at Legain. Also, there are more surfers in Legain so it would be easier for anyone to spot you if you're in trouble. *In fact I had to be saved by a lifeguard after getting swept out by a riptide!"
Leonie B,Tecoma,Sep 2015,Beautiful place to sit back relax and watch the sun set. Shopping is good and you don't have to indulge if you don't want to. Have a drink and take it all in.
Christina89137,"London, UK",Sep 2015,"We loved the beach, there are chairs & umbrellas for hire. A few food places locally for all budgets. Lots of locals selling anything from bracelets to watches, sunglasses, painting etc. the waves are amazing, but quite fierce at times so not great for kids, unless they don't go very far in the water. Fair few surfers enjoying the waves when we were there. "
Brooke M,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"Nice clean sand, great waves but not too dangerous. Huge beach with clean waters and good atmosphere."
Shantanu Jalgaonkar,"Pune, India",Oct 2015,Amazing beach with good basic facility and nice views. Amazing sun set. A good place for night life and family holidays
Yoshi Y,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Sep 2015,"I think Kuta is the best one but for me Seminyak beach is great one for Sunset, the wave not as big as in Kuta but it great for beginner surfing. I did surfing but i can""t do it. I ill come here again!"
pingaroo,"Chicago, IL",Sep 2015,"We read that beaches in Bali are nothing to rave about so didn't have a high expectation. Actually Seminyak beach as well the adjoining beaches exceeded our expectations. We stayed at the Oberoi, which is located on Seminyak beach. Everyday, we walked either north towards the W hotel or south towards the airport for 2-3 hours. For the most part, the beach has fine white sand and is clean and empty. There are quite a few ""natural"" waterways draining into the ocean on the beach. Our hotel claims it's from the rice fields, but these waterways smelled awfully like sewer. In between the luxury hotels, there would be the odd house with a garbage dump right on the beach. The southern end of the beach is a bit rowdy and touristy but has better sand. If you go in the morning before the partiers wake up, then it's serene and romantic. Sunsets are gorgeous! "
Tania M,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Sep 2015,"We visited this beach a number of times during our stay in Bali. During the day the beach is covered with lounge chairs and umbrellas to hire (we were quoted $20 for an hour) as well as people selling just about everything. In the evening, the lounges are mostly away, the bars open up and the people flock to see the sunset. The beach is wide and the water is cool and refreshing. It is relatively clean and there is plenty of space for everyone."
CelloOnWheels,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,We walked for a very long time but definitely worth it and so many bars along the way to pop into. Unbeatable sunset viewing!
Little_Ewi_travel,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2015,"It's the Australians version of the Brits spain. HOWEVER,  the beach is all but spotless. They charge sooo much (for Asia) for beds but they're some of the comfiest beds we've had in a year of beaches in Asia. By the end of the day the sea ia so far out and the waves were so big we gave up but that's because were lazy.Looked great for surfing. "
Chris T,132 contributions,Oct 2015,"A lovely clean beach to swim, surf, relax on or just look at. Not as protected as Sanur but much cleaner and prettier than Kuta"
TrevorDoornbos,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,"Ok, so you will have to pay somewhere between AUD$15-25 for 2 sun lounges on the beach for 1/2 to a whole day, about AUD$10 for a good sarong, massage, kites, sunglasses etc, and yes you will get hassled by the local entrepreneurs to buy from them.This is their island.  This is how they make money to live, pay the bills and put food on the table.Have fun. Be friendly, and make an attempt to speak at lest 2-3 words in their language.If you are rude and disrespectful, the you deserve the same in response.We had a great 5 days in Seminyak by following a few simple rules.Don't ask the price unless you intend to buy.Don't ask to see unless you intend to buy.Be realistic in your haggling.This is modern day Bali where everyone has a motor scooter and needs to pay high rents to live close enough to the tourist area to work.These humans that work the beach have families to support and are absolutely flabbergasted when rich tourists who spend $000's to come to Bali then get upset at paying $20 for 2 lounges for 4-5 hours on one of the best spots on the planet. So!Be polite and smile.Learn a little Bahasa (That's Indonesian - Language on business in Bali).Selamat - Pagi, Siang, Sore¬†(Morning, Afternoon 11-2, Afternoon 2-5)Tidak Terama Kasih - No thank youTerama Kasih - Thank youSatu/Dua/Tiga Jam - One/two/three hoursMahal - ExpensiveDiskoun - Discount pleaseWe came back after 5 years and Kathy still sells Sarongs and does a great back, neck, foot massage, and of course hair braiding.Billy The Kid and Charlie Brown sell watches and sunglasses.Denny does an amazing Henna Tattoo - Both my girls got them And all of this right in font of Ku De Ta, so you can walk up and use the foot/body showers to rinse off the sand/salt in between swims, and of course to head up and grab a delicious snack/lunch. We had lunch there two days and it was fantastic!Salt and pepper calamaris was great. Great curries and sate. Steak and chips, steak sandwiches etc.And of course a bar.Definitely worth a visit and to come back to."
meltravelled,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,"Seminyak beach is one of my preferred beaches in along Kuta. A little quieter, cleaner and you can get some amazing sunsets."
Benoit M,"Paris, France",Aug 2015,A Beach with a lot of people that want to show off... We appreciated much more the calm beaches of Lombok or Amed
Gabi Stenzel,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,This Beach is nice but you will find much better ones in Bali like in Padang Bai. Good is that you will find shops and restaurants around.
JessicaWorldTraveler,"Los Angeles, CA",Dec 2014,"Seminyak (while not a beautiful beach as it is full of trash) is a great area in Bali where many of the young people go. Full of restaurants, shops and clubs, it is buzzing with energy. "
Nomadic Boys Gay Travel Blog,"London, UK",Sep 2015,It's a good beach if you don't want to go in it - good for sunset and people watching. But it's a strong current so pointless for swimming - good for surfers.
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,Nice beach but crowded. Not very good place to go if it is peak season. Good to sit down in evening to watch sunset.
Deadgeckoo,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"Personally I thing if you're in the area and not planning to spend the day at one of the oh so trendy beach clubs dotted around you're better off at Double Six.  The beach is often too wavy for swimming and depending on the time of day it can be quite dirty.  If you're nearby it's not a bad way to spend the day, but I certainly wouldn't make an effort."
Rachel L,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,"Not my favourite beach. As it's a public beach, I felt that it was not well maintained. Obviously there's trash everywhere, and because they allow dogs to loiter, watch where you step! You may end up stepping on dog poo - which would be unpleasant. Also there are warungs set up near the entrance to the beach, but no proper trash disposal, so quite smelly unfortunately. Unsightly. "
Dipi7,29 contributions,Sep 2015,Best beach to have in the morning and evening. You can go around 5.30pm and wait the sunset. Sunset is amazing.Many good cafe.
S4853PFjennyc,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Lovely clean beaches with a great selection of food choices and bars along the beach strip. Our favourite restaurant for lunch was Champlung for nice relaxing lunch with great variety of food and very cold bintangs. Staff friendly and provide quick service
AweDi,24 contributions,Sep 2015,"The Seminyak beach is long and wide, you can walk, walk and walk or stay wherever you want and watch people. Sunsets are so beautiful! Sea is not too quiet but you can still enjoy it. Beach is clean (city workers continuously clean it)."
Nusye,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Like others beach in Bali.. Like Kuta, and Legian.. this beach one of best beach to enjoy Sunset in Bali. Worth to Go.. You can walk from Kuta Beach, Legian Beach, Double Six, then Seminyak Beach"
Peter G,"Brighton, UK",Aug 2015,"Spent many days and nights on Sminyak beach. The beach is huge and when we went in August it was busy enough but not packed. Plenty of bars/restuarants and many sun loungers to lie on, laid on the sand one day but even a light breeze will cover you and you stuff in sand. We generally paid 200K rupiah for two beds, sometimes more, sometimes less. The waves can get quite big so I think it's best to excercise caution, the pull of the sea is incredibly strong and if you're not a strong swimmer (or drunk) you could get into trouble quite quickly. The water was pretty clear.. It's one of the cleaner beaches we visited on the island. Quite a lot of people trying to sell you bracelets, paintings or massages but a smile and a no thank you and they'll leave you alone. Don't let that put you off coming here. At susnset you can sit on beanbags at the numerous restaurants and watch the sun go down while acoustic musicians play/sing. Too many playing Hotel California though! But very chilled way to spend an evening."
putueka,"North Kuta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,The beach is nice for lay down but not really good for swimming because wave is big and water not so clear. Better you go to balangan or pandawa beach in South bali 
Mark-1411,"Lichfield, UK",Sep 2015,Had a wonderful leisurely walk along the beach. Lovely setting. Will definitely return at sometime in the future. 
Richy27,"Puteaux, France",Aug 2015,"Very nice beach, especially for body board and surf. Restaurant and small shops on the beach. At 5 pm just drink a bintang and relax for the sunset show every day !"
Scott C,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Oct 2014,"Massive tidal movement here so a very very wide beach. The beach itself is OK but wouldn't rush there for a swim. Legian itself is a crazy place after 3pm when the traffic hits town and the Muslims that live here are all trying to get to prayer time.Other than that go a bit further south for a swim at Tuban. It's on the other sie of Kuta. Quieter, don't need to pay for a sun lounge, just drop your towel and in you go. The water is deeper and so cooler as well. Good friendly people down her."
William M,"Brosna, Ireland",Sep 2015,Relatively clean bearing in mind the numbers using it. Sun beds cheap enough ‚Ç¨6 per person a day. Beach side bars. Plenty of surfers and surfing equipment and training . Normal problem with people selling but they go if you say 'NO'.  Sunset is beautiful. A tourist beach but worth a visit
Sue M,"Cairns, Australia",Sep 2015,We just love the vibe of Seminyak beach. Love the beach bars and the waves. The whole beach comes alive in the evening and is just beautiful.
Sharon B,"Central Mangrove, Australia",Sep 2015,Relaxing on the beach cold Bentag  the music live great atmosphere great food just beautiful large been bags great place to catch and relax
Eva T,"San Diego, CA",Sep 2015,"Nice beach with rough waves...at least when I was there. Had purchased the local beer, Bintang and fresh coconut juice at the local eatery stand on the beach which were refreshing!"
bj582015,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,excellent beach cafes but the venders on the beach can be frustrating as the interrupt conversation to try to sell cheap goods .. I felt sorry for them but didn't want their items
Kim P,18 contributions,Sep 2015,"Must be one of the most beatyful beaches i have seen (no sharks) big waves, perfekt for surfing. Only minus is the sales people constantly saying ""want to buy"". "
Osipova K–∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–∞,"St. Petersburg, Russia",Sep 2015,Wide and big beach! a lot of surfing schools and rentals! You can rent sunbeds for 100 000 IDR per 2 person.
Paul T,"Bundaberg, Australia",Oct 2014,"My wife & I spent many hours on this beach drinking and relaxing on the sun beds at Willys Bar. Willy is a great guy, very friendly and accomodating, my wife does'nt like the taste of Bintang so we asked Willy if he would get us some Heiniken in for the following days, we paid him up front for what we thought we would drink and for the next few days we had ice cold Heinikens on call. The boys will also deliver your lunch! Nasi Goreng or Mi  Goreng for about $2.50 Au. Great beach good bunch of locals. We visited Oct 2014 and again this year Sept 2015."
Mysen90,"Sandnes, Norway",Sep 2015,I abselutely  LOVE seminyak and the beach is included. Stay at La Plancha for a nice sunset view with small appetisers and drinks.
Trevor S,"Oakleigh, Australia",Sep 2015,Day and night Seminyak beach has good beginners surf. Lots of rental places. Cold drinks beach chairs and sunsets are beautiful.  Then live music every night outside anyone of the cafes sitting in a bean bag.
Jimcheng222,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,This part of the Bali beach i would say is the 'higher end' side of the beach. Not sure if the sand is better; maybe the same.  BUT the nice and more expensive restaurants are in Seminyak beach.  In any case it's a really long long stretch so even from Kuta you can walk to Seminyak
Flowdream,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",Oct 2014,This beach has lots of hotels along it that are great to stay in. At night there are places to go along the beach but the day finds it full of tourists. It is a long beach and so is good for a long walk but very hot in the day.
Peditschon,Indonesia,Sep 2015,Good beach for you to have a surf lesson. Some local guide can teach you how to surf. The wave is not very big but quiet good for surfing. The beach also very nice for you to relax and sun bathing while you enjoy a bottle of beer.
Kitten84,Aberdeen,Jul 2015,"Miles of white sand, choppy sea and blue skies! Pineapple as you walk along the beach washed down with a 35 bingtang. Heaven on earth "
sylviecha2015,"Paris, France",Sep 2015,Difficult to swin and dangerous but lively with surfers.I tried to stay there for a while but too many preach sellers and you can't read more than 5 miinutes.Nice for long walks.
ThomvRijckevorsel,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2015,Me and my friends were staying in Seminyak for a few days and we went to the beach quite a lot. The nice thing about Seminyak beach is that it's less crowded than Kuta beach. There's a lot of nice little bars and restaurants where you can lounge around in a bean bag or have a nice lunch with an ocean view. It has the perfect mix of laid-back and luxurious. 
deboruccis2015,"Cowes, Australia",Sep 2015,Couldn't believe all the high rise . Tourists with NO idea of the rips Fortunately can still get the best Bakso on the beach at Jalan Butinelg near Seminyak/ kerokaban 
Sufyan87,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,"Nice beach to visit, waters were cool, dark sand though. Waves were pretty strong, ideal for body-boarding. "
lightcatcher77,"Munich, Germany",Sep 2015,"Kuta Beach is just 5 min by car away but it's worth.For hidden dream beaches you're at the wrong place , but for cheap drinks or coconuts you will get good offers."
Candz33,"Plettenberg Bay, South Africa",Aug 2015,"If you enjoy taking long strolls on beautiful beaches, then Seminyak beach is a must! Lovely white sands, beautiful hotels to look at and many restaurants to choose from when you need a rest."
AWorldView,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2015,"Seminyak beach is great for spending the day in the sun on beautiful long stretch of beach with people around who wanna spend time lazing on the beach,eat drink at local restaurants with rows and rows of comfy beach sun beds with umbrellas that are available for whole day from morn to eve at resonable rates..just take one of these and you are all set to relax and enjoy the beautiful beach"
mvavalis,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2015,This is a very nice beach if you don't want to travel far from the central area. The sand is not white but the beach itself is really nice as it is very long and lots of little bars along it with bean bags and music. Nice waves to learn how to surf. Clean. And later on at night there is live music and you can see the sunset.
Karthik A,19 contributions,Sep 2015,Unlike kuta... Seminyak beach is open till late. Theres soo many bars who offer very Decent prices... 
Carolina N,"Malolo Island, Fiji",Aug 2015,"Seminyak beach has 'black' sand and average water clarity. During the day it's all about relaxing, having a coupe of beers and reading a book. If you want a chair and some shade you have to pay around $10-20 per couple. I would recommend heading there in the evening to watch the sunset, have a cocktail and listen to some live acoustic music at one of the many restaurants which supply bean bags and cute colourful shades."
justine,"Zhongshan District, Taipei",Sep 2015,Seminyak beach is quiet and serene considering how central and busy it's located. I love coming here. The sunset is just beautiful. 
CSdreams803,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"It is a beautiful white sand beach in Seminyak.  It was fantastic to run on the beach, and you could enjoy a lovely view to sunset on the beach.  My boyfriend and I were staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort and we loved this beach.  "
Clover90vt,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Oct 2014,"The color of the sea water and the sand is not as what I imagined. The water is not blue, the sand is dark, rough and not white. But I do appreciate the beauty of the Mother Nature there. Strong waves are perfect for surfing. The beach is clean, food is great, though a little expensive - but still worth it! (I stayed there 3 nights and all restaurants in the area turned out amazing). I just wish they have more seafood restaurants that would sell more of lobsters, mantis, crabs... I couldnt find one though, most of the restaurants serve little prawns, sea bass, scallop, some other kinds of fish only. Maybe I would search for more next time. "
Roger S,Gold Coast Australia,Jul 2015,"We stayed at the Pelangi which opens out to the beach. We walked and swam every morning. It is a fun place with surf schools, good surf, kites, restaurants and coffee shops. Lots of people playing on the beach, lounge chairs for hire. At night warungs with cheap food and drink, bean bags and entertainment. Everything a beach should be. "
Kelgret,14 contributions,Aug 2015,Great beach to sit back relax and watch the day go by.......and the people of course! Only thing is I much prefer an Aussie beach as I would not trust the water or what could be floating in it. Large waves and strong undercurrents. Great place to watch the sun go down though with a beer in hand!
Peder D,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2014,Nice beach but beware as it is also a bit of a foodie tourist trap. Many of the beach sea food restaurants are ushering in customers well above their serving capacity resulting in extreme waiting times. Also check your selected fish isnt stuffed with ice when it goes on the scale for weighing. When you have picked your good restaurant you are almost guaranteed a splendid sunset view
lamasgergo,"Budapest, Hungary",Aug 2015,"Choose a bar next to the beach get a beer and enjoy the sunset. Most of places has live music or dj, so the atmosphere of this place at sunset is incredible. You have to see and feel it."
matteomath,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"One beach line from Kuta, but the location is more premium and high class. You need to prepare more money here to enjoy the view."
Philippa G,4 contributions,Aug 2015,"The sand was black, and swimming was prohibited often due to large waves and rips. The beach was nice to take long walks and did have many lounges to hire with umbrellas to give shade. There was a lot of nightlife on the beach which was exciting and colourful and music to enjoy."
mzdimplez s,2 contributions,Aug 2015,I thought I'd go to the beach and relax and read a book. That didn't happen. I was harassed for about two hours by hawkers. I kept saying no and they kept coming. I went to walk away and someone grabbed me and yelled at me for not buying anything. I would never go back and I am not impressed at all. 
Stuart S,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Probably wouldnt travel to this beach if we did not stay in the area. But it was good, clean and had little hawkers compared to elsewhere. Good restaurants in the area and go anywhere to view an awesome sunset. Great for kids to, lots of shallows and sand."
ThomasF,556 contributions,Aug 2015,"A nice place to go and see the sun set, of you do not want to go to Potato head or a hotel , find a beany bag place and just sit down with a beer and enjoy the sunset and the vibe"
Martin W,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Aug 2015,"Not many hawkers to bother you, nice and clean, life guards on duty through the day. Everybody was laid back and having fun, surf was O.K. Close to hotel and Capil beach bar and grill, easy walk."
Nugget1969,34 contributions,Aug 2015,"Great beach, good food, great night life,music,Bintang and the sunsets are great beautiful place to spend your days in bali"
annarhi,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2014,"Discovered the beach by walking through streets, was crowded and nothing special. Suddenly became bombarbed with people trying to sell me bracelets, henna tattoos, sarongs and even one lady pushing to sell me sarong clips. Feeling very overhwlemd by so many people crowding me for my money and hassling me. The woman selling me the sarong clip made me hold the item and refused to let me give it back. Needless to say after buying 6 bracelets, 2 sarongs, 2 clips and promosing to come back later for henna I left and never went back. "
Gizwiz81,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2015,"Loved hanging out on the Beach Hotel bean bags of an evening, cheap drinks and watching the sunset each day. Couldn't get any better. The beach is also full of life, live music, people playing soccer.. is just the best when you come from the hustle of a city."
Miss M,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,Beautiful sunsets to be seen while relaxing on bean bags at any of the bars along the beach.  Highly recommend. 
ska112233,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,We went here a few times during our stay in seminyak. Sun lounges by day.... Bean bags by night. Or just lay down a towel and enjoy it. Beautiful spot to watch the sunset. 
davidalexsz,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Seminyak Beach is perfect for couples or any solo traveler who desire to experience the beauty of nature. This particular beach in Bali offers tourists with perfect ambiance which enables you to appreciate Balinese beaches. Many resorts and villas are built along the beach, so accessibility is great!Don't forget to catch the Sunset moments when you are in Semminyak Beach.."
elsie l,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,"My 3rd visit to Seminyak. Going to the beach is always on the itinerary.  The sand is fine and clean and it a joy to walk, jog or just stroll especially in the early morning or evening to enjoy the cool breeze. On this 3rd visit, we decided to walk the entire stretch of the beach from Kuta back to Petitengit. It was a most enjoyable hour and a half walk with sandals in our hands, stopping now and then to take photos of the scenery and the people around us building sand castles, flying kites and playing beach volley ball and soccer.  We also get the know some of the beautiful hotels, pubs and restaurants along the beach.  It was also a good workout before we wash up and head to La Lucciola for our gourmet dinner! "
dee l,"London, UK",Aug 2015,clean great for surfing great bars and restaurants along the front and delightful beach.stalls selling kites sarongs jewellery etc who are fun to barter with  as well being able to buy their drinks and foods and rent beach chairs from make Seminyak beach a pleasure to swim surf sunbathe practise yoga and exercise or walk on 
neilsa,"Spring Park, MN",Aug 2015,Huge waves.. But noone surfing or swimming..this tells me dangerous undercurrent..great sunset. I'm.a convert next time .to look at hotels here. Beach relatively clean
Rob B,23 contributions,Aug 2015,"With there being many pretty beaches on bali, seminyak beach is filled with beanbags for maximum chillage. Though the atmosphere is nice it wasn't my kind of beach experience since there were do many people. There is a change for some nice waves though I've seen them get pretty big so beginners should surf here with caution."
TheRealAlvinLim,"Selangor, Malaysia",May 2015,I love beaches around Bali. It gave me the feeling that I'm free or happy I should say. Wi be back to this place. I took the entrance at KuDeTa. Just walking distance from Amadea hotel which I had stayed
GettingThereAndBack,"Helsinki, Finland",Aug 2015,"Seminyak's Beach offers a more secluded ambiance compared to its sister strands of Kuta and Legian to the south.The atmosphere is much more sophisticated and laid-back than Kuta or Legian, and the beach is quieter during the day. "
Sumaya K,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2015,i likes this beach the most because of the waves which were great for surfing if you are not a surfer you can easily find a trainer which a good price an excellent area for relaxing
elmsie7,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,"The beach itself is ok and there are heaps of better beaches around the world but Seminyak has a number of very good bars and restaurants close by. Sunset is a great time for relaxing, having a few drinks and then pick a good restaurant nearby for the evening. There is always something going on. There is board, wetsuit and dive gear for hire."
Jo P,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2015,"We only went to the beach once, the hawkers make it an unbearable experience. Bali government would be wise to follow in Thailand's footsteps and make them illegal."
maryrose h,"Southampton, UK",Feb 2015,"Hotel looked like a concrete maze, but actually the next day when we got our bearings it was actually very good.Gorgeous swimming pool, surrounded with  beautiful tropical plants & trees. Staff very charming & helpful."
Nipun_Parikh,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2015,It's a very nice beach. Wide stretch of white sands with waves perfect for surfing. Has some beautiful restaurants and great beach clubs to view the perfect sunset. Lot's of places to rent a surf board.
freckl48,Victoria,Aug 2015,This beach Is a lot quieter than Kuta and perfect if you have children. Just the best sunsets also. Lots of eating places too
Subhasree789,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,Clean and happening at the beach! with lot of hotels put up a well lit and romantically decorated restaurants by the coastline!
atkinsba,"Ottawa, Canada",Aug 2015,"We spent a couple of odd days on the golden sand in the comfort of the Courtyard Marriott Beach Club where the staff are so friendly and have towels, bottled water and ice lollies on demand. It was at night though that it really came alive with all the roadside restaurants setting up tables and bean bags with candles down on the beach."
Dpradhan,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,Go there before 5 pm. Grab some beer and enjoy the sunset. The children do have a lot of fun. There are good eating joints along and  just outside the beach.
runawaysuzie,"Cairns, Australia",Aug 2015,"Crowded, hawkers, drunken tourists and noise. Sorry not a area of Bali I am interested in. If you come for culture and scenery then go north from ubud. This area is jus for cheap drunken tourists."
Sinan B,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Love it here. Relaxing, warm weather, lovely locals and cheap bintangs. What's there not to like? Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes"
leahlovesicecream,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,Great to relax on the beach :) beautiful spot to escape the madness of Bali traffic and enjoy a cocktail.
Cathy V,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Great waves, but lots of rips. Listen to the life guards! Drinks available to buy on the beach but be wary of paying too much for sun lounges"
ChristinaPtr,"Thessaloniki, Greece",Aug 2015,"nice view, nice sunshet, nice place to chill, but not for swimming. if you are Greek you know what i mean..."
tony532015,"Bunbury, Australia",Apr 2015,"Stunning tidal beach offering something for everyone from top surfers, to belly boarders, to walking through shallows, good for kids, ideal for veryone."
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Aug 2015,"It's definitely more laid back than Kuta's. Some say its also more sophisticated. Wet part is dominated mostly by surfers, while sandy and dry one, by lazy vacationers under umbrellas. Food and drinks are available too. Decent restaurants and bars are just across the road behind. Some experts would say that fresh young Indonesian meat is for sale here too (mostly in the afternoon though). It has what it takes to have enjoyable few hours. "
The_Prof,"Darwin, Australia",Aug 2015,"A beach, smelly and the water was not really good to swim in. There are sections which are pristine (outside hotels) but some of it includes a sewerage run-off so be careful. "
Vandy85,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Aug 2015,A beach full of  beautiful and colourful cafes/bars. A sunset walk followed by some drinks and dinner under those colourful umbrellas is a good option for chillaxed evenings. But if you want clean sparkling water and silence then this in not the beach. Its got its own charm with a touristy touch. 
Josh J,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Aug 2015,"As we were staying nearby we spent four hours at this beach from 10am-2pm.The sands are a mixture of the usual colour and light grey, restaurants and hotel  pools line the small beach.There is a lot less people here than at Kuta and Legian beaches so it's ideal if you want a more chilled out beach experience in Bali.If swimming make sure you take extra care, swimming within the designated areas (flags) and not venturing out too far as the currents are strong. Would definitely not recommended any kids going into the sea.Overall, a nice beach for a break from the crowds."
Polo_and_Marco,"Guildford, UK",Sep 2014,The beach all along that coast is lovely and wide. The sand is nice and fine and you can rent loungers and parasols from the various beach bars. Its the perfect place to watch the sun set while sipping on a cold Bintang. The water is warm but there is generally some surf. I ticked off learning to surf on Seminyak Beach from my bucket list.
Julie R,"Wurenlos, Switzerland",Jul 2015,"Never have enough,,wish to stay more longer, we always looking forward to be here again..see you soon seminyak beach!!"
Hieke W,"Taupo District, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"Nice sandy beach, lots to see and lots to do.Many places to sit and have drinks and snacks.In the evening it is nicely lit."
priyank_traveller,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,This beach is quiet compared to Kuta but much cleaner and good if you want to spend some quality time with friends and family
bee992015,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Seminyak Beach is very clean and relaxing surroundings, not to crowded, you can really enjoy your sunbathing or swimming or surfing"
fxign,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"For those of you who dont have a lot of time in bali, you can try seminyak beach. Instead of doing nothing at hotel, enjoy the beach here or eat near the seminyak beach, it offers a lot of restaurant / cafe"
PaulineMM,"Langwarrin, Australia",Aug 2015,A good beach for surfing and bogie boarding. To rent a lounge and umbrella was a bit expensive but worth it to stay out of the hot sun!
Rosetta P,28 contributions,Dec 2014,"I went here for new years night and it was one of the best nights of my life - music, dancing, drinks, fun, amazing fireworks, brilliant people just perfect night!"
goonercaz,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,"I visited the place with our little one.Big beach with lots of good surf. Days of wave did alternate so easy wave days were good for the little ones to paddle and stay safe.Disappointed though with the cleanness of the beach. Rubbish floating around the waters edge.Also  certain parts smelt so a sewage outlet may have been near by.The beaches volcanic residue means bathing suits get ruined so only wear dark coloured ones if you plan to do beach sand castle building. It would have been nice to have more beach restaurants as there were only big ones attached to hotels. The ones that were there had a high security manned setup, so not sure if the Bali bombing in Dec 2004 (?) stopped all all the smaller restaurants doing business. Would still visit the beach but keep it cleaner please."
claire255100,Melbourne,Aug 2015,"Nice long stretch of beach. Good for walks. Seems popular for surfing. The bars and music along the beach set the holiday scene.Occasionally there are sewerage run offs which smell pretty unpleasant. Didn't entice me to swim.I hear the sunsets are spectacular but unfortunately the volcanic ash created such a haze, that the sun was swallowed by thick cloud and no sunsets were to be enjoyed."
babybushka,30 contributions,Aug 2015,"Had a great time there - bigger surf and not many peddlers, a bit away from all the other people which was nice."
Compass2101,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"I guess a surfer who grew up riding the beautiful spots on Sydney's Northern Beaches is going to have a tough measuring stick!  Not a great beach break, however I did get one memorable 177m / 28.7km ride.  No headlands or reefs of interest.  The trade-winds blow cross-shore fairly early in the day.  You can rent deck chairs.  Shopping and bar in the area are good.  Potatohead and Ku De Ta are great - Check em out.  Better of surf the Bukit Peninsula!"
Ereny F,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2015,Beautiful clean beach ..great to watch sunset and relax. has nice restaurants and u can rent seats with umbrella.
ally,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,"Clean beautiful beach, good waves, with a couple of inexpensive cafes with wifi to choose from for lunch/dinner."
gygee_fan,bekasi,Aug 2015,"sands felt softer that kuta, expensive umbrella and beach seats rental (200k IDR for locals and 300k IDR for foreigners), good place to play at before noonunfortunately there was a big excavator running around for some building projects so I was worrying my toddler being close to it."
lovefoodNtrips,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Love the soft sands and calming sea! We went to the beach around the evening so it is great to look at. At night, there are a lot of restaurants that will set up chairs and table at the beach. You get to listen to the sound of the waves as you dine. A great experience indeed! however, you have to plan your route around tot he beach. The first time when we arrived, we were not clear of how to go and ended up arriving after the sun sets. We went there for a second time to catch the sunset. A tip, plan and ask clearly on how to go!"
Alexitan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,I love this beach. This is a bra for you to go if you prefer slow and serenity. Kuta beach however is more of a happening beach!My bf and I love this beach ! ^^ 
Merlantis,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"Lovely beach, interesting waves, loads of food, it's like the perfect set up, but the open sewers running onto and across the beach, which people ignore and simply walk through, kind of grosses me out. It's like this on other beaches along this southern stretch of coast too so it's just one of those things. Unless you want to walk for miles along the beach you may not even notice it. I noticed it a lot! The touts are there but they are not aggressive or persistent. Mainly just selling sarongs and paintings and sometimes quite odd things. But they don't pressure or annoy, they are just there.  Unlike the JetSki and paragliding touts in Patong who block your path and follow you and won't leave you alone!"
Brenden A,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Horse back riding.Back massage.ManicurePedicureFoot scrubTemporary tattooHair braidesLearn to wake board / surfJust soak up the sun and zzzzzz under the umbrella as you lay on the beach chair. Charges for 3 hours is 100,000 Rupiah. Full day - walk around and ask best price - haggle like crazy. Then pick a good spot to unwind.While peddlars are lesser than say Kuta and Denpasar beach, be firm when they start peddling you trinklets and unwanted services. Eye contact with them - Dont. They come and surround you like bees to a flower.Take a stroll along the coastline. I couldnt as I sprain my foot. Yet the peddlars were most understanding and made me more comfortable. Pedicure, foot scrub, nail varnish and back massage by three ladies. And free trinklets - wrist bands üòçüòç Bring a beach towel should you find the chairs rental steep. Bottled water, sun screen / block, hat, sunglasses and a good book.What I was looking for - a hammock under coconut trees to lay down with coconut juice / water. Alas.... bean bags and beach chairs aplenty."
Rioleb,"Beirut, Lebanon",May 2015,"Great surfing beach that is very affordable compared to US and LatAm even. Beers also are abundant and cheap. Not the most amazing beach in the world. Dont go there if you are expecting the famous picturesque clear water Bali beaches. Probably better to go to Nusa Dua.Also, the water is a bit dirty unfortunately :(End the day at KuDeTa or Potato Head for fancier drinks"
j01216,"Spa, Belgium",Aug 2015,"The beach is pretty nice but they are a lot of pollution like everywhere in Bali.. That is so bad because you swim between garbages.. (cans, chips packet,...) But still fun especially if you surf! "
Jabema,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,Seminyak beach was clean with plenty of dark yellow sand. Surf breaks seemed consistent. Swimming was confined to a few patrolled areas. Few vendors to annoy you. Plenty of restaurants fronting the beach. Multiple lounges for hire. Popular spot for local dog owners to exercise their pets although they were never a problem for beach goers. Nothing to make it a must visit beach over other Bali beaches.
Thong J,14 contributions,Aug 2015,"smooth fine sands, nice waves, great place for kids to play sand and for adults to chill and relax for the whole day!"
wheeliemandy,"Gosford, Australia",Jan 2015,being in a wheelchair i enjoyed the beach from a bar on the beach. Was a great spot to enjoy the sunset. You do get people selling things all the time but that is part of the Bali experience
Coleen P,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",Jul 2015,"Best was sitting on the beach in a bean bag, eating, listening to music and watching sunset.  Great to walk along in the mornings and very few sellers confronting you."
samuelsings,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"This is one long stretch of beach. My wofe and I walked for as long as an hour, sitting on the sand and people watching.Some visitors brought their dogs and locals were there too to enjoy the setting sun."
Travellor,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2015,"Lovely beach, be prepared for hawkers selling stuff. But overall great beach to visit. Plently of places to eat and relax. "
Julia2307,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Seminyak Beach is a long straight stretch of surf beach, heavily built up and used by one and all!  Edged by resorts, locals, cafes & beach shops, with resident dogs,it is inclined to collect rubbish from far & wide, but is ""groomed"" each morning so is OK.  I wouldn't swim in the surf... local streams drain into it! Great for early walks to get appetite up to indulge a breakfast, or wonderful sunset viewing as you sip your cocktails! .."
Jodie_L_Hart,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,Dirty dirty dirty! We travelled here in Dec/Jan 2014.... Terrible time to visit. Super busy and the currents send the rubbish down from Java. It was a massive disappointment
Ramesh Bachani B,16 contributions,Jun 2015,"While the sea bed gently slopes down,  unless one is a very powerful swimmer,  one needs to exercise caution here as the rip currents are very strong here.  Beautiful n clean with many eateries lining the beach.  Prices are reasonable too.. Deck chairs and boogie/surf boards available for rent. Highly recommended!"
Neil G,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"This beach is good to sit and watch the sunset but not a good swimming beach ,you get too many rips and tide movements . Again surrounded by many hotels and Villas .Also Seminyak centre just over the sand dunes for a relaxing dinner and drinks ."
Asish Agarwal,"Jeypore, India",Sep 2014,"Seminyak Beach is Bali's most fashionable place, home to among the island's best resorts and large number of fine restaurants >"
RMartinSDXB,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Mar 2015,"One of the most beautiful sunsets I ever seen was here, in the beach of Seminyak where the sun drops down in a mix of beautiful colors. The beach as a beach is not the cleanest and the water is not as clear as in the beaches on the east coast but its a nice place to relax, specially during the afternoons."
Reg C,"Taree, Australia",Jul 2015,"Very good beach, close to hotel and shopping. Restaurants and bars on beach either sitting in restaurant or on the beach with umbrella and beach chairs or bean bags."
Annette088,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Clean, not too many hawkers, ok swimming if like waves, chairs to sit on for a cost. Lovely relaxing outlook with good umbrellas,  can hire boards etc if want or get drinks fruit etc "
Hatzlacha,Virginia,Aug 2015,"This beach has a bit of something for everyone.  It seems a bit north of Jl. Camplung Tanduk is the quieter area with lots of rentable beach chairs and space for water activities.  It was far from overcrowded.  South of the street began the row of bars, restaurants, and related party atmosphere.  Much more crowded.  Lots of conflicting noises on that side.  But there were plenty of waves when we visited and the water is warm.  Some dogs around but they mostly prefer the sunshine to people.  So it's a nice public beach everyone (adults and families alike) can enjoy.  "
grahamw309,"Semaphore, Australia",May 2015,"The beach at Seminyak is extremely busy with small bars and lounges for the tourists. Unfortunately, the strong currents mean that only experienced swimmers should attempt to enter the water here."
lil_miss_brum,"Kinver, UK",Jul 2015,Spent quite a bit of time on the beach - quite a few hawkers but they are very pleasant and won't bother you once you have said no thank you. The waves are great fun. We rented a body board and a surf board and tried out hand - mixed results but lots of fun!!
annettebeard,"Brighton, UK",Aug 2015,Beautiful unspoilt beach away from all the brashness of the main hack. Very safe beach despite large waves as lots of lifeguards and flags to ensure safety. Very pleasant family orientated beach.
8151ian,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Had a few bintangs on the beach just over the road from Cocoon.Great live local entertainment at nights  but some of the bars have the music up loud to try and drown out the bar next doors music.Was a bit windy most nights but still pleasant. More for the younger age group who like sitting in beanbags, relaxing and enjoying the atmposphere."
tagabukid,"Dumaguete City, Philippines",Jul 2015,"questionable hygiene and safety, seems no surf patrol and rips visible, quite a lot of plastics and empty bottles"
ebfootprints,4 contributions,May 2015,Great cocktails on the beach! Awesome sunsets! Waves are incredible! Beer cheap! Very relaxing place!
Mark J,"Didcot, UK",Jul 2015,"Having spent a week on the east coast at Sanur, I can safely say Seminyak's beach is far better, hands down. It's sandier, lighter and cleaner, plus it has much bigger and more impressive waves and fabulous sunsets. My family happily spent all day on the beach watching the surfers at play. The only negative is the hawkers trying to flog you their kites, hats, sarongs and watches. That said compared to other tourist hotspots they were not at all aggressive and quickly moved on after a quick no.We were staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa with attractive infinity pool overlooking the beach. I did spot two cheeky families rock up to the beach in front and then let their children enter the hotel pool. The hotel security didn't bat an eyelid, which was disappointing. Anyway it's a great beach, not at all crowded and the sunset views are pretty special. No need to traipse all the way over to join the crowds at Tanah Lot."
kim p,"Hitchin, UK",Jul 2015,Lovely beach but the sun beds are as expensive as Europe and here you get pestered by sellers walking up and down all day long. Make sure you barter for sun bed price 
Parky1968,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Less hawkers and more relaxing. Closer to more boutique bars, shops and restaurants. 30 min brisk walk to the outskirts of Kuta. Not as many beach bars and surf lessons."
Emilyprimrose,9 contributions,Jul 2015,"Sunset was lovely to watch and sit by the bean bags listening to music, I wouldn't eat on the beach though, the best place was Capil Beach but that was expensive, all the others had really bad food and seemed very dirty. The toilets in all the places bar Capil beach are awful "
annie23015,"Mandurah, Australia",Jul 2015,"Nice beach, at this time of year (July) the sand is clean, great spot to sit in a bean bag, listen to a band and have a drink"
EwaHagert,"Malm√∂, Sweden",Jul 2015,"Lovely long beach with white sand huge waves. Strong current at times. Lots of restaurants for lunch and dinners and absolutely amazing in the evening with after-beach cushions and lanterns. SO romantic.Beach chairs with umbrella is exensive. 300 000 ruphies for a day for 2 beds. However, sunbeds are super luxury so really a treat but if you plan to go to the beach everyday it adds up. Especially if you are a big family. WIndy."
RBNS8184,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,Best beach and quiet beach.Calm and walkable distance to seminyak square.view is good. Family goers can enjoy the beach but be careful the current is strong kids must be guided by their parents.photogenic place
S0412,"Island of Malta, Malta",Jul 2015,"amazing sunsets, nice and quiet during the day...restaurants located near by!don't forget your sunscreen and be careful the waves can be a bit rough at times!"
Hanna,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2015,Worth the visit if staying in the area. It's more of a beach than lovina and is nice to walk along. Water seemed clean and there are areas with good waves. The beach is pretty clean but you come across public areas which have an increase in rubbish which is the only let down. The fancy hotels look after their sections of beach which is good. There are a few nice bars on the beach which are great to stop in for a drink.
Zac P,7 contributions,Nov 2014,Love the variety of bars and markets around this beach. A beautiful walk whether romantic or with friends.
Gerri m,Australia,Jul 2015,When you first arrive to Bali...and see this beach...you will love it...but once you have explored Bali's truly magnificent beaches this dosnt compare...nice for a stroll at sunset and looking at different Accommodation along the way.
Jeremy F,"Constantia, South Africa",Jul 2015,"The beach often has big waves and is rough, so its not great for swimming. It also has not got the best waves for surfing either, but every now and then the banks are ok. The beach club is very nice to hang out at and the vibe for tanning and having some drinks is pretty cool to. Dark sand and just not up there with many other beaches. More of a party and pic nic spot. "
Quinn E,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,ku de ta - always an essential  for dinig and cocktails. seminyak beach resort - accommodation. nice for night time walks 
OsakaShurling,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Perfect sand and sea. What makes Bali famous. Soft powdery sand, beautiful sea - with pretty strong waves for the surfing enthusiasts."
ibm_gaurav,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2015,"This was a awesome beach we visited while in Seminyak region. It has high waves, but the beach is shallow, so we could go in and enjoy the waves. Very good beach for surfers due to good high waves.The sand is packed and dense, so one can easily walk on beach and enjoy long strolls.The beach is very near to the famous Seminyak Square."
winardini,31 contributions,Aug 2014,"Good beach, clean enough. Recliners and umbrellas were up for rent. You can have a good coconut, or just sodas and mineral water for a small fee. When you're hungry, go to the restaurants facing the beach. "
ronval1912,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,we went in the afternoon. didn't find it particularly nice and the beach is littered with ciggie butts
FABourdain,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"I consider myself a bit of an expert on nice beaches.  Seminyak is a great beach with nice sand.  It's a very wide beach, and when the tide is out it can be 200 meters or more wide.  There is no drop off, and the bottom is sandy.  Great for surfing, body surfing and swimming.  There are some rip currents when the surf is big, so pay attention to the flags.  You can also rent chairs with umbrellas if you don't want to lay in the sand.  Plenty of restaurants on the beach, and great for sunsets.  I'd give it 5 stars,but‚Ä¶  there is a definite problem with the amount of plastic garbage that washes up on the beach.  And here's my suggestion - the government should take a portion of the entry tax they collect and hire people to pick up the beach.  People work for very little in Bali.  Start on one end and just pick it up.  With tourism seemingly the main industry in Bali, I'm surprised they don't do a better job.  And the hawkers can become a bit much as well.  I mean, I don't really need a painting of an elephant or buddah.  "
KiwiGe0rge,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2015,Beach is quite steep and dumpy - especially at the change of tide tide. Keep an eye on your kids. More relaxed than the Kuta end of the beach. Less sellers and pumping music. Nice and relaxing.
NickiKMelbourne,Melbourne,Jul 2015,The beach was great but you do get bombarded by hawkers a bit - eventually they left us alone until the next batch arrived an hour later!
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,"This is the most fashionable beach area on the island with luxurious hotels, fashionable clubs and fine dining restaurants. Lovely to watch sunset here and then the whole area comes alive after that!"
jackirmic,"Austinmer, Australia",Jul 2015,Lovely clean beach. We enjoyed running of a morning at sunrise. It was a great way to greet each day. The sunsets were magical. 
Imogen D,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,"Pretty, especcially at sunset. recommended to u all. luv it. for the lovers of free spirits and ego wounded souls"
TrishFD,"Canberra, Australia",Jul 2015,"clean, clear water. great sunsets. great surf for swimming and body surfing.  great to walk along.  easy access to all Seminyak activities, restaurants and resorts"
jdb339,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,Much better beach than Kuta or Legian. Is easy to get to and has a good selection of places to eat. Good place to relax at
OliverMalcolm,"Athens, Greece",Jul 2015,"The beach itself is pretty average. The sand is quite grey and ash coloured. As a beach, a much better choice would be dreamland beach. But Seminyak beach is easy to get to, great to walk up and down, and has all the beach clubs located on it. It's a much nicer way of walking to the main part of Seminyak than along the roads."
engelangie,Czech Republic,Jul 2015,"Lovely beach and a great place to just relax, take stroll or hang out with friends. The beach is relatively clean."
Compass Bali Tour,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jul 2015,not really nice but still ok ;)in sunset time it's will be nice..but to many people here and not really clean.i prepare going to balangan beach
st√©phane B,"Geneva, Switzerland",Jul 2015,The seminyak beach is the best on on the kuta - legian - seminyak side as it is large and lits of space to seat. Sun seats are great - not that cheap for Bali - and there are cool restaurants on the beach
Utantan,"Kobe, Japan",Aug 2014,"Seminyak beach is a great place to go for so many possibilities. Deserted or almost so in early morning for a great run on the beach (half marathon distance possible !), crowded in the evening with seaside bars pumping their music, great waves to enjoy, many fantastic restaurants to eat in if you venture a bit into the streets, great shopping within walking distance, the occasional ceremony with Balinese people gathering to let their offerings go into the sea, an evening drink at La Luciola. Yes, Seminyak is polluted, too crowded and not as authentic as it used to be 15 years back but it's still one of the best place to visit in the area !"
Wetwedgie,"London, UK",Jul 2015,"Truly beautiful beach, which is alot quieter than legian and kuta. Great just to hangout on the beach or walk up and down taking in all the awesome of Bali."
NoVolcanicAsh,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,the boys say that the hamburgers in the black bread rolls are the best. They had burger meals with chips and lemonade.
YK N,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2015,"We heard so much about Seminyak Beach therefore we decided to visit this popular place on a weekday.  We walked for about 15 minutes from Seminyak Square and reached the beach through KudeTa at about 5.00pm.   The beach was quite crowded with both locals and foreigners, and there were a lot of sellers who approaches you all the time with their junks.  The beach is not that clean compared to those on the eastern side of the island."
Wayan Arjana,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"nice beach for see sun set, walk a long the beach to see a lot of nice restaurant such as kudeta, lauciola, potato head beach club and many others. use your sun screen for protection. don forget bring a sarong if you want to visit petitenget temple."
ThompsonBuggins,"Bushmills, UK",Jul 2015,"Loved the fact that it was not as crowded with beach visitors, benches etc and that it was still enough people around that you could enjoy the buzz of the beach. Watching surfers, having the kids play in the waves and sand and going for runs made it our favourite beach in Seminyak. "
marke07,Sydney,Jul 2015,"A long shallow beach which felt safe, and provided just enough swell to allow some fun on the boogie boards. It was quite clean (though it looks much nicer at high tide than low), and economical sun beds and umbrellas for hire, along with surf & boogie boards."
Phill B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2015,"I like the beach and it's a great place to eat and drink, be mindful of the many junk sellers who may harass you at times. Also remember a beach chair should cost no more than $5AUD a day. I'd advise going to outer beaches if you are looking to surf."
Donny J,46 contributions,Jul 2015,"Nice beach away from the crowded area kuta, with vibrant store and villa, the waves is good. Waiting for sunset here is a must."
BenLane76,"South Yarra, Australia",Jul 2015,Hit the beach early with the locals as it's the best part of the day to get some exercise done before hitting the pool or what evere else you have planned!
riotheelephant,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Jun 2015,"The beach was alright and a nice place to chill and relax, but there's a lot nicer beach around Bali - I really recommend Uluwatu!!"
Ben M,"Dallas, TX",Apr 2015,The beach itself is pretty dirty and not as idyllic as I thought it would be however that's why the hotels have pools. Still a great place to visit and see a sunset
KiwiMat 7,55 contributions,Jun 2015,Atmosphere and views was great. We relaxed on the beach while the children played in the sand and we had a beer
achiichan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,It's really a beautiful beach and it's good for sunset. Many cafes and rstaurant around there so that we can eat dinner while waiting for sunset. It's romantic and beautiful^^
BigBronco351,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Great to wander down to the beach just before sunset and lob in a bean bag, order a drink, maybe a meal listen to the music and watch the sun set over the ocean - Perfect!"
Mike,35 contributions,Aug 2014,"Great place to chill out and have a beer on the beach, Seminyak is renowned for the finer things in Bali, though people say it's expensive that's only by Bali standards, you can expect to pay Australian prices at the restaurants."
Stacey H,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach was not pleasant at all. The sand was streaked with black, obviously from oil, which meant there weren't very many people on the beach either. I suspect that it's visited mainly in the late afternoon evening due to all the bars/restaurants on the beach, but in the morning it's just gross."
Paul M,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"Its the beach side of Kuta without the mess of it. Its a little more expensive for everything i.e. surfboards and beach chairs but its worth the additional expense as its far more quaint, especially with KudeTa playing nice lounge music in the background"
Farrah T,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2014,Bali has changed so much over the past 10 years but one thing that has remained the same is the amazing sun set views that you get to experience from the beach. 
Jodie C,73 contributions,Jun 2015,"The beaches in the built up areas of Bali are a bit hit and miss. Unfortunately the practice of making offerings the the Gods on the beach, Many of which containing, plastic wrapped lollies and cigarettes, leads to a beaches strewn with debris. It is such a shame. The Seminyak beach had rubbish floating in it which is a bit disconcerting for an Australian but the warm water and beautiful blue skies are bound to draw you in and out past the shoreline mess."
Harshit_V2,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2015,It has an amazing Sunset and the beach is really clean and you can just sit on the many shacks on the beach and enjoy the sunset alongwith a drink
CelestineSwee,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,"Went there for the sunset. The beach is really pretty and crowded. Good mix of locals and foreigners. However the toilets are very rundown and doesn't offer much privacy, so you should wear your swimwear there, otherwise it is hard to change. Many restaurants and bars lining the beach to choose from, but most of them are pricey. Beware of local men secretly taking photos of girls in swimwear."
rowQld,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2014,Visiting Bali for the first time was so exciting and Seminyak Beach was one of the great spots that we really enjoyed. We will came back again soon.
KaKwok,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,"Ummmm.... it's a beach. What can I say. When we were there, there we night markets, shows and so on but we just got scammed that day so in a less then happy mood. Still, having said that, the wife did like the night life and it made her smile so you take what you want out of that"
Helen G,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2014,"Lovely beach where you can relax,swim and unwindThere are bars on the beach with music and diningThere's also a bean bag bar which is so bohoThere are tables with lamps and beanbags-finished off nicely with a Bintang !:)"
yo_graham,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Feb 2015,"The sea was too choppy to go in, and there were pesky peddlers bugging you to buy something. Most people were in the pool in nearby resorts. "
Truthful Reviews,"London, UK",Jul 2015,"We stayed at the Oberoi (see my review) and visited the beach several times to see the amazing sunset. I've got an old iphone4 and people thought my pics were photo shopped....they were not. The sea, sand and sky did all the talking.....and it was all talking to the sun as it said selemat malam for the night. WOW AMAZING!"
Shaliqua,Geelong,Jun 2015,"I love Seminyak Beach with its long stretches of sand and surf! It is a great place to take a long walk or run before the sun gets too hot, and then a swim afterwards. I enjoyed a lounger and drink on the beach, but made a mistake when making a purchase with a hawker of goods. One buy and I was inundated with people trying to sell me overpriced goods. I found that my no must have sounded more like a yes to them, because I ended up with foot and hand massages, plucked eyebrows, jewellery and other goods, most of which I paid too much for. But for all that, I did enjoy myself! I learnt a huge lesson on not being a sucker for a friendly lady who had supposedly not made any sales that day as she had just come a funeral! I had a good laugh that day and did come away with a sense of fun and joy even though I had been shamelessly been taken advantage of. You just need to be stronger than me! It is a glorious beach though!"
amyz_world,500 contributions,Jul 2015,"This beach has a beautiful sunset advantage point, the colours of the sky is amazing that I couldn't stop taking pictures of it. It's very touristy and so many people on it, so if you're wanting a quiet beach go elsewhere."
Ian C,"Carlisle, UK",Jun 2015,"Some nice beach bars with not bad music ,we didn't do any sunbathing on the beach so I can't give an accurate review on that but I was informed that the sea was not too clean "
RizaL Sulaeman,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"the most popular spot to have a sunset, most people flock to this area however some people just simply hang around at the public area of the beach and others just spread out to the nicest restaurant or bar around the beach. It is the trendy beach in the island"
Madamjojo1,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach was really rough, the current dragged our 9 year old out a couple of times so we couldn't really relax and enjoy the swim.  Great for surfers though!  The sand was that yucky black kind that sticks to everything, you need a chair to sunbake."
BhumikaWadhwa,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2015,"Average beach, good crowd...Good place to watch the sunset! We tried many restaurants along this beach..Overall good experience.."
John W,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,Great views but pit about the volcanic soil making the beach black and the pollution. I will not swim in the water.
Ian,"London, UK",Jun 2015,Just sit on the beach and watch the sunset. It's probably one of the most relaxing thing to do in Bali. 
sheetalkhandekar,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,This can be totally skipped. Private beaches at many hotels are much better maintained than the public beach.
Jeisre,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2014,"I visited in 2010 for the first time and was taken aback by the stunning sunset, however even then the beach itself wasn't great, and it grossly deteriorated ever since. Dirty, grey-ish sand, lots of rubbish, which is not cleaned. The water was murky and muddy, and wasn't inviting at all. One of the locals on a later visit also advised me that it wasn't 'good' to swim, especially after the rain, when all the inland rubbish gets washed via the streams into the bay. I saw lots of nasties floating in those streams, so would agree with that advice. It's such a shame that no one takes responsibility for keeping it clean, as it would have attracted many more tourists if it was maintained. The sunsets are beautiful and many people come to the beach-side bars just for it. Any beach-going experience will most certainly be interrupted by the local hawkers trying to sell you something."
BenGtho,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,the beach if further away from city center or kuta/legian area and seminyak is considered as expensive area now.not much to say about the beach frankly; it's the same as other beaches in bali imo.
Grace B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Relaxing. A real holiday feel, especially at sunset when you are able to choose amongst the many restaurants along the beach, find a bean bag to relax on, eat drink and listen to live music. I prefer swimming in the beaches not so populated, which there are plenty of. Seminyak is great for good food and shopping also. It does need to be careful not to become to pricey as this may deter a lot of travellers. Ubud for day spas is an absolute must!"
CarolChia,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"I like the beach, coffee plantation and rice plantation.  The food in Bali is very good. One of the Indonesia restaurant known as Warung Mina located at Jln Kayu Putih No. 19, the food is excellent and value for money."
JamesSharpe,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"Nice views, but dirty beach. The local authority needs to do more to tidy up after all the bogans! Other than that very nice, with friendly beach bars. For the gay traveller seek out Bali Joes, who will give you an amazing welcome. And COOOOOOLD beers! "
EnglBellaItalia,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"Aaah... this is hard to write. I love being by the ocean and on a beach, and this beach has pros and cons.The views of the sunset are outstanding at this beach. There are many eating and drinking possibilites everywhere, and the ocean is clean if a little rough - hence the amount of surfers that congregate here to do their thing.The road leading to the beach is constantly busy with mopeds and Vespa-like vehicles. It is something to watch the weaving in and out fo these riders, and it's a wonder how they do not fall off their vehicles, or hit people or things as they go... but they don't! What I didn't care for was the constant being asked to buy things from the local sellers on the beach. In truth I felt sorry for them. They were only trying to make a living by selling local stuff to tourists. But mostly, the tourists just want a beach holiday without the albeit friendly (but intrusive and cnstant all the same) harassment to buy all kinds of stuff. I was only here four days, but it really began to get on my nerves by the end of the second day.The beach itself might disappoint someone if they were epecting tropical white sandy beaches... the sand is a dark brown/grey due to its volcanic origin.All in all, not my favourite beach in the world, but I can see me being on it again, once I have forgotten how annoying the sellers can be."
Neve,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Mar 2015,There's no better way to unwind after a hot day walking the Seminyak streets for a bargain or visiting the local attractions than to sit on Seminyak beach. Take in the sunset while sitting in the Seminyak sand drinking a beer or cocktail. The many local establishments serve light meals and drinks amongst beanbags and dim lights.
Caroline C,GB,May 2015,"Great beach, not white sand but full of atmosphere. At night the beach bars extend out onto the beach, great music, beautiful sunsets. Lots of safe swimming"
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"We like to meet up with friends along this section of the beach, rent 2 long chairs and umbrella for 50,000rp for the day and then make sure to swim between the flags as there are strong rips along the beach."
BaliSharks,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Crazy, never seen a beach commercialized like this.  Now view as all the umbrellas and beach chairs take up all the natural space.  Sad.  Rainy season its full of trash due to the winds & currents as rains wash rubbish into the seas. Island of the Gods must be pissed.  Bukit beaches or outside the commercial zones are more pleasant.  However there can be nice sunsets from that side."
Le M,"Mount Duneed, Australia",Jun 2015,Seminyak beach in June was pretty clean and rubbush free (for a Bali beach). It was great to people watch with Ex-Pats walking their 'horse-like' dogs and locals participating in ceremonies as the sun rises. The sand is still pretty grey but the setting is lovely worth the effort of a walk in the steamy air.
Sebastian_Hui,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,You should be there in the morning and sunset! The endless Indian Ocean makes you WOW! Some people jog on the beach in the morning and some people walk their dogs in the noon time. I love it day and night!
Laura M,18 contributions,May 2015,"Well we found it to be very dirty  the sand after walking a short distance leaves a blackish residue on your feet, so for us walking along the pathways beside the beach was fine. We found much the same conditions at other beaches, however one very positive note, the sunsets are spectacular.  For the rest of our flexible holiday we headed inland, maybe no ocean but jungle is something else. Additionally where we live in Australia we are right on the beach so perhaps a little spoilt!"
Ingrid T,"Lusaka, Zambia",Jun 2015,We had a swim around nine in the morning. Tthe beach was clean and the water warm and lovely. Our hotel Sarinande was just a short walk back.
traveller5605,"Tumby Bay, Australia",May 2015,"Plenty of beachfront restaurants to watch sunset from along Seminyak Beach. Book a restaurant and arrive early enough for sunset, one with happy hour even better"
jo C,"Gisborne, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"We walked from our resort in Seminyak down the beach to Legian.  Took about an huor and was enjoyed by mum, dad and 4 kids.  Lots of beach bars/resorts along the way to buy drinks.  Also a few hagglers selling sunglasses which was funny for the kids to deal with"
DrSuz_12,"Ogden, UT",Jun 2015,"We stayed at the beach and walked in the surf every morning. The food is so good with a view of the sunset. We enjoyed the fitness room, too!Since it was an anniversary trip, the hotel upgraded us to a beautiful suite with a private pool at the Garden. This morning, I saw huge lizard about 2 feet long. He was afraid of me and hurriedly dove into the pond and swam away.  There are beautiful grounds, flowers, and solicitous staff. It is truly a paradise. Tonight, we are going on an elephant ride in the sunset. "
Steven J,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"We are blessed with some fabulous beaches in Australia so comparisons are dangerous. Seminyak had dirty surf on the couple of times we hit the beach (the pool at the villa was much more inviting!). Like most beaches, it pays to swim where it's safe and listen to the lifeguards - we did see one mature gentleman saved from a rip."
farpavilions,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,Mmmm....not for me.....too much 'stuff' littering the beach. Even though a tractor travels along the beach 'raking' it is not so effective. After rain the water looks disgusting and dumping waves serve as caution to bathers.
Leedon73,Singapore,Jun 2015,"Huge long beach with mild surf. It's very flat, you can walk about 150 to 200 meters towards the sea before hitting the water. Wind was great for kite flying. Very safe for young children. Sand blackish, but fine. Only problem with beach was slight unpleasant smell of rotting vegetation. "
minninme,minninme,Jun 2015,Sunsets are great but during the day the place gets so crowded that I'd stay away. Go early in the morning (like 7am-8am) if you insist on seeing it during the daylight.
TheKristopher,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach can be covered in litter during the day from selfish tourists but lovely to walk on at night, soft sand and lots of restaurants on the beach itself."
Stormie,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,The sunsets on this beach are amazing. Lots of great hotels and restaurants all along this beach. A little quieter than Kuta. 
Janis J,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"My husband went daily to swim and loved every minute of it.Lovely long sandy beach with sand cleaned daily, People walking, swimming enjoying."
Sheena B,"London, UK",Jun 2015,"Very clean beach in a lovely scenic setting, no selelrs on the beach which was a great bonus, sunset is amazing"
Geraldine M,78 contributions,Feb 2015,The beach isn't great in Seminyak but there is plenty of hotels and beachclubs surrounding it that you can get the benefit of an amazing beach sunset. Some of the hotels have cleaned their area up but overall it isnt a great beach
Cdm104,"Durham, NC",Jul 2014,"It's a beach to sit and enjoy the atmosphere, there were a good number of surfers. There are a lot of rocks so it's not about swimming."
Charlotte F,"Brussels, Belgium",Jun 2015,"We rent a bodyboard, a sunbed and we spent the whole day at Seminyak Beach! One of the best activities I did, very affordable (110K for the day for two). The beach in itself is nice, not the most beautiful one in Bali but not too overcrowded."
Ritazell,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,"Wide black sand beach,  suitable for novice surf board riders.Not great for swimmers.  In fact, the only people in the water were kids, learning to ride boards"
KIMDEE63,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"The beach was a great place to pull up a bean bag and listen to some music whilst watching the sunset and the waves roll in.  You can also surf although the waves weren't overly big, I think if your looking for surf maybe you need to go to Echo Beach or other surf beaches with bigger waves.The dislike about the beach is the black sand."
DhruvThakkar,73 contributions,Jun 2015,Has a wide beach area where one can enjoy a nice walk in the evening watching the sunset. Very clean. The noise from the seafront restaurants starts from sundown which is a negative
PHKORL,246 contributions,May 2015,"Absolutely loved the sunset view from out hotel room. If you plan on staying in Seminyak, it's best to stay in W Retreat or any beach front villas. Seminyak is so populated and commercialized now, so staying in a secluded area is rewarding. "
Nomadlookingtosettle,"Bengaluru, India",Apr 2015,"Seminyak beach is a beautiful beach. You can find plenty of vendors  for beach benches and umbrellas at reasonable rates. If some one is interested in surfing, there are a couple of surfing schools right on the beach. One thing to be careful about is where you get your money exchanged for local currency. You will find plenty of small shops claiming to be 'authorized currency dealers', however a vast majority of them give you less money than what is mentioned at the shop entrance.Particularly, one member of their team will distract you with general questions while the person handling the currency will hand you less money than what they owe you. So always count the money yourself even if the shop owners counted it in fornt of you. We wound "" Central K"" group of shops very reliable when it came to money exchange. If you are looking of good art work and wood work, I would recommend buying it from Ubud where you will find products with better quality. "
nadap905,"Montreal, Canada",Jun 2015,better to go to Kuta beach the chairs and rest areas are better and closer. People ignored the off limit areas which was embarrassing as a foreigner we should respect local traditions. In this case no swimming because of holy site
Lea32_11,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,"I was very disappointed in my trip here having heard so much about Seminyak and its beachReally this is just one very long beach that stretches from Kuta and beyond Seminyak.With so many 'world' restaurants I was hard pressed to find one serving the local food.the beach vendors (of which there are many) were pushy which added to my sad trip to this place.Basically the tourists have pretty much ruined these places in Bali, too many people for the infrastructure and everyone trying to get their $ from the tourists (and you cannot blame them)"
vox-sf,"Chicago, IL",Sep 2014,"This is a broad, fairly maintained, if a bit rough patch of surf.  We walked up and down it at least once.  There were a few people out.  Some fisherman to avoid, too."
Amanda,"Trinity Beach, Australia",Apr 2015,"It was nice and clean, no rubbish in April. Had lunch at Ku De Ta not to may hawkers around. Wasn't very busy this time of year.."
8rigittamelisa,Indonesia,Jul 2014,"When I stay at one of the budget hotels in the area of Seminyak, the next morning I decided to wake up early to enjoy the sunrise on Seminyak Beach.It only takes about 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach.You can enjoy the morning air of Seminyak area.And alsomany people who ran or cycled in the morning.Nice scenery in the morning!"
Angela W,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"The beach was pretty and reasonably clean. There were people swimming and surfing. Just a shame that every 5 minutes someone is trying to sell you a chair, a foot massage, earrings, boogie board or time share."
Sally H,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,Generally the sea was too rough to swim in . There are plenty of nice restaurants to eat at and to watch the sunset from.
Sarah M,Melbourne,Jun 2015,"Great for drinks and dinner on the beach - La Plancha is brilliant, we ate prawns and chicken along with. Urges and curry - all was fantastic! "
Smotherone99,"Greater Perth, Australia",May 2015,we spent a lovely evening sitting on big comfy bean bags sipping cocktails on the beach at sunset....
nathan060721,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Not bad considering it is in Bali. Black/Grey sand and pretty clean. Also, the water was a great temp and the street food by the beach amazing!"
ezjosa,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"The Seminyak beach is located not really far from Kuta. The place itself is cleaner than Kuta, but please don't expect less crowd here. My visit was during the sunset time and it was a pleasurable experience. Watching the sun goes down, looking at the sky, and hear the wave voice, so amazing! I would love to come back again to enjoy this beautiful view!"
Kemistry,UK,Jun 2015,"busy beach, which may explain the colour of the sand‚Ä¶was a little disappointed, thought it would be cleaner. Lots of people. Nice to watch the sunset if the sky is clear."
Farah E,7 contributions,May 2015,After having come from the southern tip of Bali I stayed in Seminyak at the W. I had an incredible ocean view room and slept and woke to this vivacious beast-the Indian Ocean. It was very different from the Southern Bali ocean experience of calm and quiet. The beach had a lot of dog walkers so wear shoes. But expect to take them off when there's a breech in the sand and you have to wade through a bit of water to get to continue your  beach walk. This side of the island seemed risky to be in the Ocean. 
Peter C,"Newcastle, Australia",Jun 2015,Serioulsy? Bali may once have been a cheap place to go but that is no longer the case in Seminyak at least so there is little to justify spending a lot of money to leave Australia for the purpose of beach-going. The beach is uninteresting and uninviting.  The surf is large and the water murky.  The sand is grey.  Unsurprisingly no one swims there! 
Lynne P,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,Its a perfectly good beach if you haven't grown up in Australia. Its quite a compliment to say its nearly as good as Leighton or Cottesloe beaches in Perth. 
Leslie H,"Burleigh Heads, Australia",Jun 2015,Popular with swimmers and surfers during the day at night you can eat at many small restaurants on the sand and watch the sunset
Rahuli786,"Rohtak, India",Jun 2015,Depending on what you like this beach may be good or bad for you.Beach front is mostly occupied by big hotels and there are only few local restaurants .You can hardly find any local vendors selling eatables here .On the positive side crowd is not much and if you prefer to relax in a quiet place ;best place for you.
KazLamberton,Hobart,Jun 2015,"We dined at a couple of the beachside restuarants overlooking the many diners, etc on bean bags on the beach. Lovely atmosphere, relaxed and low priced. "
Edward M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,This is an experience not to missSitting on bean bags on the beach Having a quiet drink or meal watching such Sensational Sunsets
Rian C,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"The beach is quite long, and there's plenty of space to roam. Unfortunately, it is also frequented by hawkers who can be quite intrusive and annoying. If one ventures far enough, it is not uncommon to walk into areas covered in garbage... the smell of which lingers in the air. As long as one stays within the areas in front of/near the luxury beach side resorts, it would be difficult to find anything to complain about. The sand is soft and welcoming, and the water is clear. The tide can be a bit strong in areas (there are multiple advisories that recommend against swimming), which can be restrictive if one wants some semblance of privacy."
Rorkor,"Hong Kong, China",May 2015,"Large beach, was not too crowded, a few hawkers, some trash, strong waves and currents, beautiful sunsets"
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"Beautiful to watch the sun setting and see all the planes flying in. Very relaxing, and entertaining, lots of sellers, but be firm and they go away. Safe for children, who can enjoy watching the amazing waves rolling in. Every one seems happy and enjoying what the beach has to offer"
Ronny P,Perth,May 2015,Its a nice beach clean and most of the locals will leave you alone I love to chat to the locals so i have a great time lots of fun.go for it.
Mazstar2001,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2015,It's beautiful day or night on the beach. Sunsets are amazing. I got tired of saying no to the Hugh amount of sellers
Laurie R,"Rochester, MI",May 2015,"this beach may not be clean, but has great sunset views at nearby restaurants and bars that line the beach.  Lounge chairs for rent are easy to find, and there are plenty of beach bars along the beach where you can sit in the shade while watching the surf schools catching some waves."
michyap0705,KOTA KINABALU,May 2015,seminyak beach just wonderful and relax. set with nice coach on beach and you can just enjoy your romantic dinner there. no fancy dressing but relax beach wear! lovely!
TaiDofu,Taipei,May 2015,"This beach is pretty and is not in Kuta!  The waves were strong, big, and many!  This is more of a family beach than Kuta, and there are chairs that can be rented that make staying there long hours more convenient."
Tyrone P,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Enjoy the wam water and the excellent service provided by the many resturants located by the seaside ,lots of entertainment in the evening ."
Êúà‰∫ÆË™™,"Hong Kong, China",May 2015,The beach with big wave which is good for surfing. Its good to hear the voice of the ocean when dining on the beach.
joung h,South Korea,May 2015,"The beach is beautiful, clean and very attractive. We loved the sunset and warm sands. Our honeymoon time in Bali was the greatest moment and experience we had. "
Isabelle M,17 contributions,May 2015,"If you want to walk forever this is the perfect beach to do so, even if there is lots of people this beach is huge and lots of room to share, when the tide is low, the sand is perfect for jogging and speed walking, locals play soccer on th beach and it is a very oriented activity beach, standup paddle, surfing, boogieboard etc...The sand is not white but clean and pebble free, no need for shoes on the beach or in the water. It is clean in general compare to KUTA and LEGIAN but still some garbages in the water, they try to maintained it clean with workers in the morninsg which is nice to see. Lots of little paying spots to park your body and lay in the sun all day with shades and umbrellas. from having travel all over bali, this beach has it all, little restaurants to fancy Hollywood type bar and lounges to hotel and epxensive villa. really appreciated the time spend there and did not wanted to go at first. Amazing sunset and accessible to all."
Jeki I,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2015,"The Beach is perfectly right in the heart of the most famous spot in Bali, Seminyak has become a destination to visit not just for the foreigners but it also become a lifestyle gigs for the local tourist, you can go in the sunset time to this beach and you will see how people likes to hangout and see the sunset together with friends and colleague... "
Jeanette O,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2015,"The surf was excellent, and beautiful to watch. The sand was not golden, but dark coloured and I know you shouldn't compare, but not a patch on Qld beaches. The sand was so damn hot, couldn't walk on it, even with thongs......plenty of lounges which was excellent. Such a shame though to see so many hawkers and their filthy makeshift stands, really spoils the beach, but totally understand that tourism is their source of income. With labour being so cheap, it wouldn't be too difficult to clean it all up and have containers for their storage of stuff made colourful and clean, would be so more appealing and tourist would be more keen to buy stuff."
PDalal24,"Mumbai, India",May 2015,"Great beach to enjoy early morning as it gets really hot in day time. Clean place , ample recliners to rent and laze about"
VSplan,"Mumbai, India",May 2015,"Seminyak beach is great for walking around, surfing, swimming, sunset view and for lazing around with a drink by the beachside cafes"
Brad G,"Tasmania, Australia",May 2015,"Is THE place to be to watch an amazing sunset. Very busy towards the sunset, so best to get their early and lounge on one of the beach beds that you can rent from the locals. Lots of places to eat along the beach front, and plenty of places to learn to surf or hire surf equipment. "
cmsvai09,"Ludwigsburg, Germany",May 2015,"Busy beach with many sewage water flows and swimming plastics. Not suitable for a swim, also due to dangerous currents.However, nice sunset watching."
Heel4Life90,"New York City, NY",May 2015,This is the must do beach.  All of the hotspots of Seminyak can be accessed from the beach. The water is not best compared to other parts of Bali but overall good.  Downside is all of the vendors trying to sell you stuff which takes away from the relaxation time. Be sure to checkout one of the bars closer to Kuta to sit out on the bean bags and watch the sunset. Pretty kewl at night.
ianpB8845EF,"Bunbury, Australia",May 2015,"Relaxing.  The sound of the waves rolling in and the slower pace was great.  As with most of Bali's beaches, would be great if the dogs and rubbish were gone."
Kamilneu,"Ostrava, Czech Republic",May 2015,Be aware of huge waves and streams sometimes . It is much safer in the afternoon.................................................................
470iputua,Indonesia,May 2015,Seminyak one of the beaches to retreat so that the touris so impressed to see the beauty of the beaches of Seminyak
Meera R,"London, UK",May 2015,very quiet clean and high security- you feel very safeNice romantic walkclose to Ku DE TA and potatoe head
ChilliGarlic,"Marrickville, Australia",May 2015,"Our hotel opened on to this beach, which is wide, patrolled and with waves that you can surf or body surf. Great! Plenty of washed-up rubbish on the tide-line, but it did appear to be removed each day. Lounges and food are cheap and this end of the stretch isn't crowded."
Sharon M,"Lymington, UK",May 2015,"WE loved to go down to the beach at around 5.30, after a busy day sightseeing. Grab a seat, or beanbag at one of the many bars,order a super cold Bintang local beer (try the Radler lemon, its amazing) and chill out, people watch and relax. Fantastic!!"
jamie m,singapore,May 2015,"Great beach if it was not for the thoughtless dog owners who walk this beach while their dogs are not leached, they run all over sniffing your belongings you have in your bag while their owners just stand by looking as stupid as their dogs, so I can't recommend this beach at all."
Megan C,"Townsville, Australia",May 2015,"nice clean beach, the beach sellers get very annoying though. There are no lifesavers so you need to watch out if you have children."
jsethu,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2015,Calm beach a bit crowded over the weekends. The locals were friendly and my son enjoyed the surfing . The sewage entering the beach was a put off for me
kazo,"Braintree, UK",May 2015,Went on Sunday so watch sunset. It's a busy beach with lots of locals and tourists. Not great sand and choppy sea. 
dry_surfing,"Huntington Beach, CA",Apr 2015,"went on a overcast morning, the water was warm, wave was nice and sand was not over heated like it would be on a sunny day."
Gavin__Hope,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2015,Wide open spaces with a broad surf. Didn't see many swimmers. Nice to walk or jog along the beach. A bit dirty in spots
Yoko L,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2015,"Clean beach with relax and laidback surrounding and welcoming tennant. Souvenir seller still offer you a thing or two but not that pushy, they have their own area to kept clean and sell their goods, fair enough. Love the scenery, really nice breeze, just pick a coconut and enjoy."
Lisl A,16 contributions,Apr 2015,Loved it and great to relax with bintangi beers and have swims - the sea was great better than last year which i visited in June and it was quite rough to swim.
nickfromParis,"Paris, France",May 2015,"I spent 4 days on this beach , nice atmosphere in daytime with surfers , beach restaurants and at night ,after sunset , with bars on the beach offering live music while you see the colors of the sky changing , amazing!And if U do not surf , you can swim , where is permitted , skipping the waves... Much better place to swim than Sanur! Also very nice for walking on the beach in the early morning , at low tide....enjoy!"
David_Marsh_11,Gold Coast QLD,Apr 2015,"Excess rubbish on the beach, seems like no one cleans up after they leave. There is a small number of cleaners that concentrate on a small area of the beach"
Oldlorrie,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2015,The many and varied eateries along the beaches were a great place to sit and chill with a cold Bintang and watch the glorious sunsets!
Tripti B,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,The beach is nice and the sand is fine. There are few shacks to enjoy beer or coconut water. The water was good and my daughter particularly enjoyed it.
Abhijit_In,India,May 2015,We loved sipping beer and eating finger food at one of the beach side restaurants.  The service was prompt and friendly.  One of the waiters even drove me to a nearby ATM to pay the bill :-)
CirclethePacific,Canada,Mar 2015,"This was our last stop on a 6month trip and the beach was great, lots of fun in the surf and many places to eat, drink and people watch.  Remember this is Asia, so the beaches are a bit dirty and may have some garbage.  Don't let that ruin your experience."
MHafiqAR,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Apr 2015,"Walk along the beach and enjoy the white sandy beach! Strong wave and good for surfing.. Love the hang out area with bean bag and acoustic music, such a perfect place to hang out with friends or even your love ones :D"
Craig C,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,Rest  under a beach umbrella and on a comfortable beach lounge whilst drinking a beer . Disliked the black sand
Gerald2463,"Mangalore, India",Apr 2015,Not too crowded like Kuta. Walked along the beach and relaxed with a few cocktails on one of the resort restaurants on the beach side.
Dayborotravellers,Iceland,Apr 2015,"We are from QLD so we are spoilt where beaches are concerned.  There was lots of rubbish and brown sand, waves were too big to swim.  Unfortunately most of Bali that we saw, didnt have nice beaches but that doesnt matter when you have beautiful pools!"
NMilne,"Vancouver, Canada",May 2015,"Came to this beach two times over two days, and teh second day was too much. The hawkers are quite annoying, and persistent, they will come back every hour to offer you the same item you already turned down. One lady started touching my feet while I was asleep suntanning on a chair, that bothered me, although she wanted to sell me a foot massage, I didn't appreciate her touching me unexpected and unwanted.What is great here though are the lounge chairs with an umbrella for 50K/ all day, and there is surfing and many good beach restaurants with bean bag chairs and cheap ice cold Bintang. Stick around for a beautiful sunset and cocktail. All you need is one day here, any more than that and the garbage, hawkers and smells may bother you."
ggmmii,"Chennai (Madras), India",Apr 2015,"This definitely had lesser people than the kuta beach but still was quite crowded.Its a long beach and a must visit if you are in seminyak.We spent the evening having dinner at one of restaurants along the beach-even-though the food wasn't great,the ambiance and sitting on those comfy informal seating where you can lie down and gaze at the sky and the stretching horizons was a memorable experience."
Marjiegene,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2015,Garbage and broken glass would not go in past my knees here. Have to really be on the look out for broken glass in sand.
Paul B,"Enschede, Overijssel, Netherlands",Apr 2015,"As a natural Beach you will have to travel far to find something as pristine as this. however depending on the time of the year it can be really busy. most annoying are the ""Traders"". it is a continious pattern of trying to sell you something. From Kites to Watches."
Njays,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2015,"I don't think you go to Bali for the beaches...and if you do my friend, there is quite a bit of the world for you to see yet.The beach in Seminyak was a dull grey colour...quite a few pieces of rubbish on the sand...a lot of bad smells and frankly you'd pay me (a heck of a lot) to go for a swim there.Visitors please do care. Bali is a wonderful place but it has, as in any developing countries, a lot of work to be done in terms of getting their sewage sorted. At this point  a lot of it ends up...yes you've got it! in the spot where you want to go swim! So go back to your resort and jump in the pool!"
Zwinky1,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,"The beach is nice and clean. As it is a very touristy spot it is of course crowded.There are also some people that are trying to sell things on the beach. When we were there, the current was pretty strong so we couldn't go in the water really."
PlanetOz,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2015,"My wife and I were staying at the Double Six Luxury Hotel, so the beach is merely right in front of the hotel. The Hotel even has a security cordoned off area with lounges for guests to enjoy the scenery and the sunset."
KeithCarr-Glynn,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2015,We were delivered to the beach by golf cart from our hotel.  The sand is grey and gritty.  The number of people on the beach reflected the state of tourism currently in Bali - it was practically deserted.  There were the usual annoying hawkers but a couple of acceptable beach cafes.  The surf today (23/04/2015) was poor though a few diehards were out.  Not a very inspiring place.
Wendy D,"Byron Bay, Australia",Apr 2015,The sellers were buzzing around but we found them entertaining! The sunset is amazing. Many people but not too crowded to get a nice beanbag & plonk yourself down with a Bintang! A must do! Prices were great at the bar - even for the food. 
Nam_Onrit,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2015,"Along Seminyak beach, there are cafes and bars which serving a variety of cocktails, local and Western food.Cafes are packed since evening, they place bean bags on the beach with music bands playing cool reggae.What a wonderful time, having dinner on the beach!"
LeeHarvey,"Caulfield, Australia",Mar 2015,"The sun setting over the water was amazingly beautiful.The rolling waves looked like they should have far more people enjoying them.The walks along the beach were lonely - traveling solo, and not many fellow walkers.The sand was more like dirt than sandThe rubbish on the foreshore indicated that no-one really cared."
Simon_Carter77,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2015,"This seems like a great area of the beach, if you can embrace the hawkers, or at least not have them detract from your experience.The bars along the beach are well set-up to cater for those wanting a drink or a meal, with comfy bean-bags and umbrellas.First thing in the morning is great for running along the beach, with packed sand from the tide."
MareeJP,"East London, South Africa",Apr 2015,"After strolling down the beach one early afternoon we settled in to the bean bags out side of a Bar/ restaurant,""sorry cant remember the name"" had the most fantastic vibe and of course plenty cold beers... Sunset was amazing highly recommended way to spend an afternoon at leasure"
Erik K,"Da Nang, Vietnam",Apr 2015,"Not much more to do in Seminyak then lying on the beach and go shopping < although there are some original (clothing) shops there, do expect to see a lot of Aussi surf brands there too ...Found little of Indonesian/ Bali culture left ....Very 'touristic' and the streets are quite busy during 6-10 in the evening.Many street sellers, taxis/ cars, beach sellers and a general over-population ...Maybe this is a 'natural' development, and me being part of it should not complain so much, but nevertheless I found the visit a bit .... disappointing ... and probably will not return there.If you do go, make sure to visit restaurant Sate Bali, so at least you get some beautiful & tasty 'Bali food'!http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d1182566-Reviews-Sate_Bali-Seminyak_Bali.html"
Ellie L,"Daylesford, Australia",Apr 2015,I decided to walk on the beach towards Legian.  A guy asked if I wanted a chair however I found several ladies all wanted to provide their services.  I didn't really approve however they were so persistent so I let them & paid them.  Apart from this the beach was very quiet.Ellie
patboot,"Saskatoon, Canada",Apr 2015,Loved the body surfing and the warm water! We spent every morning at the beach and in the water! The best stretch is in front of the Oberoi Hotel!
KezzaBurton,"Burton upon Trent, UK",Apr 2015,Great place to sit with a beer and watch the sun setting over the Java sea. The sea is great for surfers here and is so lovely and warm
peatuhacs,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,"The further away you go from Kuta Beach towards Seminyak, the beach becomes less crowded and that's one of the things I like about Seminyak Beach.There are a few bars, restaurants, and beach resorts along the beach and also a warung (food stall) along the beach. Warung Cantina and Mosaic Beachclub are located on the northwestern end of the beach. Potato Head beachclub is located more towards the Kuta side of the beach. Closer to Kuta the beach can sometimes stink of sewerage, and that's one of the reason I avoided the Kuta side of the beach. The further northwest you go, the beach is less crowded and more nicer. A good place to see the sunset too. Very beautiful.You can also hire pool chairs and umbrellas from the locals for a cheap price and enjoy the view and the breeze."
Janine N,"Gympie, Australia",Apr 2015,this was the first beach we saw and thought it to be very average - we had better at home. We would not go swimming I the beach.
nicandian820,"Rochester, UK",Apr 2015,"Warning...please be careful when using the money changers in the few shops outside the Ku De Ta. they are called the Big Boss money change and they ripped us off for RP700,00 approx ¬£30 even though I counted the money 4 times, they still managed the slip notes out. They bambosle you with RP50,000 notes and try to distract you. I know ¬£30 is not a lot but when you are on a budget that can be 3 meals. Made me very distrustful of people and ruined Seminyak for me. Beach lovely but vendors renting sunbeds also tried ripping us off asking for RP200,00 for 2 hours, rather sit on the sand. In sanur, sunbeds RP40,000 - RP50,000 for all day. Even though we stayed in Seminyak we ventured into Kuta which we preferred in the long run"
Dave E,"Queensland, Australia",Jun 2014,Lots to do or nothing. Always interesting people down there. lots of eateries & beach bars to checkout. Walk up to Legian for lunch or further up to catch a boat out to the reef breaks for a surf. 
Garryraff,"Canberra, Australia",Mar 2015,"Cleaning machines scour the beach when the tide is in, leaving the most disgusting detritus when the tide goes out. "
Jay M,"Liverpool, UK",Apr 2015,"The beach here is a bit grotty but head for the shacks and enjoy a beer or cocktail watching the sunsetPlenty of hawkers but they will keep walking with a firm ""no thanks""Great surfI thought Kuta beach better for a day out"
FrankO713,"Douglas, UK",Mar 2015,"Dirty, lots of plastic in the sea and on the beach.Noisy several very noisy places along this beach."
bhurd42,"Ottawa, Canada",Mar 2015,"Good walking sand, warm waters.  Sunsets are great.  Watching sandlife during rising tides shows various 'creatures' and their creative life patterns on the beach."
chriswalsh365,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,The beach stretches for kms in both directions and is dotted with small bars and restaurants and warungs. Surfing is everywhere although there are lots of rips so take care. The sand is hard and great for walking. It's also a great place to watch the sunset
Meredith S,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2015,"great place to swim, not big waves to learn to surf, cheap drinks on the beach, have to haggle on price for lounges, if you don't mind being pesters by hawkers, nice and relaxing."
Charlotte81,England,Apr 2015,"I recently stayed at the W Hotel on Seminyak Beach.  I'd researched prior to my visit, so knew this wasn't going to be a place of beauty in Bali.  The beach was fine, however the water was too rough to swim in.  There were a few people out surfing and a couple of locals in the sea further down the beach.  The litter wasn't too bad (I understand it's much worse during the Wet season).  If you're looking for a beautiful beach on the island of Bali, I suggest you go elsewhere.  "
M F,Washington,Mar 2015,"I stayed with my family at the Royal Beach Seminyak Resort/Hotel for three nights. We had come out to the beach area adjacent to the hotel grounds after dinner. Both times the tide was very low, and we could walk a long distance before we finally hit the water. The night was clear and the sky had a quarter moon surrounded by bright stars, We had taken some beautiful photos despite the darkness."
AlKo33,"Allendale, New Jersey",Jan 2015,"There were lots of rental for chair and umbrella. The beach area was nice but recommend to wear a sandal to walk on the sand, it gets very hot during the late morning. There were lots of garbage came back from the wave and it wasn't pleasant to stay in the water to long."
BezzaPezza,"London, England, United Kingdom",Mar 2015,"OK, the actual beach is pretty grim - used syringes and nappies washed up. But go to one of the beach bars to watch the sunset, you will not be disappointed. Just steer clear of the actual shoreline, if you want a strip of sand go further up towards Potato Head"
Balilover2,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2014,"it really doesnt matter what part of this kuta stretch of coastline you spend your beach days on , but certainly there are less beach hawkers the further you get away from the actual kuta stretch of beach . there also seems to be more facilities seminyak stretch opposite the beach more restaraunts etc , and I also reckon the corn on the cob vendor has the best grilled corn in bali which is saying something , seminyak also has the best warungs near by too as well as the best tour coordinator in all of indonesia called Seminyak transport community. his name is Ian and he makes everything happen without the hassles and rip offs .cheers"
CuppyCakes1810,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Come about 5.30pm and grab a couple beach chair for Rp40,000 (for 2) and just watch the sun go down! Beautiful. Of course you are not the only one watching, therefore you should not mind the noise from other visitors. :)"
LoSmith27,"Shanghai, China",Mar 2015,"I wish I could give Seminyak a better review, but every day I was there was a wasted day of an otherwise amazing trip. I was told not to expect much from the beaches but I did not expect the amount of trash and wasted that laid everywhere. Both Kuta and Seminyak streets were crowded with motor bikes and cars which made it really difficult to walk the streets comfortably. If you would like to visit this area I would suggest staying only 1-2 days if that. The best would be to take a day trip there from another area that is less crowded."
N. Shah,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2015,"The Beach is definitely much better than Kuta, it is a little less busy has a few shacks. Good beach to go sit in a shack and have a drink or two."
Alan Gelder,"Adamstown, Australia",Jun 2014,"Seminyak is the dining capital of Bali, with some really upscale restaurants in their own private bays. I've rated some of these individually.As far as south Bali goes Seminyak is number one,- in beach cleanliness, accommodation, shopping & dining.It is comparable to Candi Dasa in the N.E."
Lyndel Y,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Apr 2014,It's a beautiful beach that has unfortunately been spoiled with polution & rubbish. Personally I would not swim at the beaches between Kuta & Seminyak. It's definitely worth venturing out further if you're a beach lover.
Jenny S,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2015,"The Seminyak Beach is not as busy as Kuta.  Along the beach frontage are a number of restaurants that have bean bags and tables on the beach which you can sit down and be waited on for dinner, drinks and enjoy the sunset view to boot.  Very enjoyable and relaxing."
Jess L,"Plano, TX",Mar 2015,"Magnificent view of sunset, comfortable beach bars, civilized crowds, endless choice of restaurants with open terrace seating facing the ocean. The path way between the hotels and beach is not well lit."
TassieLoopyLou,"Devonport, Australia",Feb 2015,We took a motor bike to check out the beaches and went to Seminyak beach first of a few. We were not impressed by all the rubble and rubbish lying around. It is also dangerous with a very strong under tow which got me by the ankles and within seconds had me off my feet and sucking me out deeper. Very scary so you need to take care. Nice place to have a relaxing drink and cool down. Friendly bar/stall owners but still get harassed by people selling things.
0911whitney,"Del Mar, CA",Mar 2015,"Seminyak beach is NOT good. Extremely polluted and the brown sand leaves something to be desired. However, the resorts that are along it are fabulous! Stick to resort life and skip the beach walks."
MattwalesNorthWales,"Chengdu, China",Mar 2015,"Of course beaches get dirty, generally the busier they are the more rubbish lazy people leave behind. Admittedly I visited in March which is well out of season but the litter levels were minimal. The water is warm, there can be a strong undertow so pay attention to the warning flags. At the North end of the beach is an area set aside for Hindu ceremonies so avoid that. Further north is the local ""gay"" beach and if you walk south you will get to Kuta beach. Plenty of surf shacks, drinks stalls, bars and local sales people are available here too."
radenayu,Bogor,Nov 2014,"I really love spending time here. Usually I came here around 4, pick a spot at Taris Bali, and then go swimming or just playing on the beach until 5. After that, I dry myself and then just enjoy my cold beer on a comfy beanbag. On some nights, you can also enjoy live music at Taris Bali."
tazman1099,"Houston, TX",Mar 2015,"Seminyak Beach is MUCH cleaner than Kuta.  Plenty of bars on the beach with chairs to sit on, and reasonably priced drinks, usually 25,000 (about $2 US).Sunsets are AMAZING!"
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Mar 2015,"It's a shame that an upscale resort like Seminyak doesn't have a better beach than this. Whilst not without its good parts, large areas are dirty and full of rubbish making them unpleasant to walk on. I know this is the case for many of Bali's beaches but surely something could be done to minimise the mess.That said, it's a great place to eat, drink, relax, swim, surf, body board or whatever. Comfy sunbeds with parasols can be rented at 100k rupia for two per day and watching the sea is mesmerising. There's always something going on and someone trying to sell you something!"
denise p,"Taylors Lakes, Australia",Jan 2015,"We were so disappointed and quite disgusted. The beach along Kuta, Legion and Seminyak was dirty and full of rubbish. We spent 10 days in Bali and did not swim in the beach once, thankfully the places we stayed at had great swimming pools. For such a popular tourist spot, something needs to be done about this problem. Maybe starting with educating people about rubbish disposal. "
SumitKukreja83,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2014,"The beaches on the western side of Bali are worst during the wet season from November to February. Garbage from nearby islands would make these beaches worst. However, Southern Bali beaches are better and more beautiful."
Dannielle B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2015,"We visited the beach at night, it was beautiful on sunset however as the waves rolled in a lot of rubbish came in with it. "
Chris-Olgui F,"Miami, FL",Feb 2015,This was the only beach i could surf at the waves were perfect. Def would go back. There was some annoying people trying to sell stuff non stop though. 
Lorna M,93 contributions,Mar 2015,"really liked seminyak beach during the day. The sand is clean as is the sea. The waves are quite strong and there are lots of beginner surf lesions going on in the mornings as there are more waves than in the afternoon when the tide goes way out. There are a few beach restaurants for a nice lunch and the sunset was also gorgeous. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people hassling you to buy hats, sunglasses etc all day and the beach chairs are not cheap. Didn't get to see the beach at night due to the Nyepi festival, everywhere was closed! "
LinusLee,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,"Not a white sand beach. went there for sunset but it's a shame that it was rather cloudy. lots of activities happening along the beach, unless you enjoy people watching, if not it can be rather boring. Other beaches should be nicer."
Maureen F,"Geelong, Australia",Mar 2015,Just came back from a couple of weeks in Seminyak and Canggu.  It was so disappointing to see all of the rubbish on the beach and in the water.  I have been going to Bali since the early 1980s and have been progressively concerned about the over-development along the lower west coast and pollution.   There was actually too much rubbish in the water for my wife and I to swim this time (plastic rubbish and probably worse).  I love the Balinese people but the rubbish and water quality is becoming unacceptable here.  Don't think that I will return.
ebyrne80,"Yeadon, UK",Mar 2015,"We decided for a walk on the beach and maybe a swim. Once we got down to it we were disgusted by the sight of it, its just full of rubbish, filthy and stinks bad. We even joked that you wouldn't be surprised  a dead dog on the beach but you probably would its that bad. In front of the hotels they clean it up each morning but the bits in between are left. Just a big disappointment as we were looking forward to a swim"
Stephen W,London,Jan 2015,"Very disappointed in Seminyak beach, actually I was shocked! It was not at all what I expected of Bali. Yes it is over-touristed which often has some side effects, but this was just a sad sight to see."
JessMorgan,"Oxenford, Australia",Feb 2015,we hardly ever went to the beach because its just full of rubbish! make sure if you sit on one of the lounge chairs expect to pay $5 AU
IAN S,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,The beach was polluted and feeble attempts to clean it up were next to useless. What more can I say.
Gary T,"Queensland, Australia",Mar 2015,"Dark sand with rubbish and lots of timber on the beach, obviously wet season runoff. Dry season may be better. "
GlobalPete2010,"Wailua, HI",Mar 2015,It is great to walk up and down this very expansive beach in front of many hotels.  You can see the jets flying from the Denpasar airport in the distance.  The sunsets are amazing in spite of some cloudy days during our visit.  This is not a swimming area and there is a lot of litter to avoid while walking.  This is a big negative but we were still able to capture many awesome photos of the surf and sky.
Vania K,"Seattle, WA",Mar 2015,"Seminyak Beach is a beautiful beach to look at. Unfortunately, any beach in Bali would be pretty polluted. As someone who grew up in Indonesia, I wish we'd paid more attention to keeping our beautiful country clean, but it was just never a priority and hopefully that's changing soon and our environment would be getting a little more TLC. Seminyak, Legian and other beaches along this coastline are great for surfing, body/boogie boarding, and watching the sunset. They are not good for swimming or snorkeling as the waves are too big. If you walk along the stretches of private beaches (exclusive to resort guests), they are likely to be clean, but go into the water and you'll likely spot some garbage (plastic bags, paper towel, piece of stick, anything you can think of) floating around. As far as the area itself, Seminyak is a hot spot, second busiest to Kuta with an older, slightly more sophisticated crowd. There are cute little shops, both modern and traditional restaurants, and bars with happy hour deals and live entertainment just about any night of the week. On the weekends (especially Saturday night), the place is a zoo. If you're looking for a little peace and quiet, you probably won't find it in Seminyak unless it's off-season and/or you're staying at a resort with a private beach. If you are looking to swim or do other water sports, Tanjung Benoa, Nusa Dua and beaches on the other coast would be much better. Plus, they also tend to be cleaner."
Nicole D,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,A great way to finish the day by watching the sunset with a drink on a beanbag. Lots of bars to choose from
kcfallen,"Houston, TX",Feb 2015,"If you go during rainy season, just understand in advance that the beach will probably be dirty and trash-ridden. My husband and I went late February and had this expectation beforehand so weren't surprised although it was still disappointing and disheartening to see. We did observe many people raking but it's probably difficult to stay ahead of all the trash washing on the shore. While it's not super bad to deal with, I wouldn't come to Bali just for the beaches and hope anyone traveling out of their way to come here would do their research and plan to spend more time inland. But if you are looking to spend time on the beach and happen to come to Bali during rainy season, you'll probably enjoy the southern (e.g. Pecatu) or eastern coast (maybe Nusa Dua) more."
SurfBee09,"East Lansing, MI",Oct 2014,"Dark, hot sand.  Definitely will need to rent an umbrella and lounge chairs.  Beautiful and delicious restaurants right on the beach! Great shopping nearby as well."
LeavemeinBali,"Western Australia, Australia",Feb 2015,"The beaches when we were there this month were covered in rubbish brought to the Bali beaches with the currents, very unfortunate. The tractors are busy in the morning doing what they can to clean up, this being funded by some of the hotels along Seminyak Beach. The government sadly, we were told does not contribute to the clean up. There is a transformation late afternoon when the sun starts to dip into the sea, families, locals and visitors all flock to the beaches to enjoy the cooler weather, the bean bag beach clubs, and to play soccer. Its a great atmosphere even though its crowded. Colored umbrellas color the horizon. These clubs seem to start north of Double Six Rd. Expect traffic jams as half of Bali spills onto the beach at sunset!  Hawkers do still try to tempt you with an array of selfie sticks, bracelets, kites and sarongs. Great place to watch the world go by sipping a Mojito or two while listening to live music. Thankyou Bali!"
Ryan R,"Lafayette, IN",Feb 2015,Pull up some bean bag chairs and enjoy cocktails and nibbles and music at any of the beach bars while watching the sun set;  A fun way to spend an evening.  Downside is the beach can get very crowded and the local peddlers can be annoyingly persistent.
Shazbuckles65,50 contributions,Feb 2015,"Bali beaches are not clean but they are raked and cleaned regularly. In peak season they are done more frequently, when I went in June they were a lot cleaner.Hawkers are a nuisance but you get used to it, it is their income and means of living.Theives and pick pockets are rife so watch what you carry with you.It was a good time of year to walk along the beach as it was so much quieter with a lot less tourists than in the month of June. In June it was so packed it was uncomfortable."
Stargazer2015,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2015,"Nice white soft sand, but not an impressive beach. I'm told it's a public beach for surfers.The shops on the roads leading to the Beach are good for budget shopping. I couldn't find any shell necklaces, which I wanted to take back as souvenirs."
Charles S,"London, UK",Mar 2015,"Traveled from the UK based on the reviews from other posts about Seminyak beach.After a not so pleasant check in, we decided to take a walk down to the beach. We were hounded by the taxi drivers and young men on the motorbikes asking if we needed a ride!!!!!!First impressions of the beach were very disappointing, I was hoping to find clear blue waters and a soft clean sandy beach.However, the beach was littered with plastic bottles, empty bags and wrappers,etc.Bali needs to ensure that their beaches are kept clean, after all, we tourists spend thousands of pounds to visit here.We were deliberately short changed twice at two of the local minute marts. Second time it happened, I pointed this out and I got the correct change after annoying looks from the staff!Don,t stop to ask the price of anything as you will get ripped off. Avoid the taxis at any cost.Only use BLUE BIRD TAXI as they all use the meter any other taxi will hustle you major and pretend to be BLUE BIRD, and avoid random men stopping in their cars asking you if you need a lift. Keep your wallets and bags close as I felt uncomfortable when the men kept stopping on their motorbikes and trying to talk to us.The sole purpose of the locals is to try and rip you off, it,s best not to entertain them or try and hold any conversation.For a country with such potential to create a amazing experience, it,s sadly let down by dirty beaches, street hustles and overly aggressive locals at every  three meters!I would not recommend Bali as a honey moon destination, it is really for the young surfers and backpackers.Don,t waste all your hard earned cash to come here."
TettyfromJakarta,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"Most of the beach is surrounded by lux hotels, so less access for public to enjoy this beach. Somehow it is cleaner than Kuta beach. Enjoy sunset and surfing too.  "
Pat B,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,Enjoy the sunset in the evening. So beautiful! In the evening there is a live music and we sit enjoy the music.
Peppy569,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2015,"Plenty of people about swimming, many restaurants at this beach but the water is dirty and much pollution, plastic, bottles floating where people swimming!!! Not for us, pool at the hotel was fantastic so no need to swim at this beach"
Clive G,"Formentera Del Segura, Spain",Mar 2015,"this beach is of black sand and the beach is full of litter and crap, nowhere near clean. it looks like a tractor runs along the length of it every morning to try and scrape up the garbage washed up on the beach. you also get pestered by sellers of beach chairs and shade as you walk along. not the best beaches for me."
MM27APR20154,"Tampa, FL",Dec 2014,I visited several beaches in Bali during my 3 weeks there and I found this to be one of the most beautiful and peaceful spots on the island. There were plenty of surfers and locals to make the time people watching pass with joy! Very beautiful at sunset!
Tyler W,"Edmonton, Canada",Feb 2015,The Seminyak Beach is very nice as the sand is perfectly smooth (although also very hot!). There is lots of space throughout the beach so it never felt crowded. Beach chairs with umbrella are available for a small fee($2-5) and are recommended to have some shade from the hot sun. Perfect for an early morning jog or sunset stroll!
Batikh,"Shenzhen, China",Feb 2015,There were some hawkers strolling the beach but they were not too intense about you buying things.  There was a good amount of beach between the umbrellas and the water for our kids to play in.  The water was also shallow for a good distance to allow some playing without worry for our young children.Negotiate with the umbrella men as they like to get hourly prices but you can get the whole day for not much more. There was some plastic in the water from time to time but it's hard to complain when the waves were as vigorous as they were.
pachanga496,Asia,Feb 2015,dirty dirty dirtyI don't know how people can call it clean ! I guess it's just flotsam from the ocean but it's a mess and ugly
Trevor N,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,The beach is quite clean now and you hardly get hassled by sellers.we enjoy the long walk and the different chats you can have with the locals.they tell you what is happening.
grb903,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2015,liked watching the Sunset on the beach and being there with the family. There are many people who sell their stuff.
Micheal T,"Terrigal, Australia",Feb 2015,Big beach but some-what dirty ... i would say that the beach clubs and restaurants  made it a lot better for the atmosphere at sunset We went to La Pranche for the sunset with friends .. great atmosphere overlooking the sunset.
Anikanepal,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Jan 2015,Clean and nice with good places to eat. Nice place to surf.  You will find a lot of trainers / nail artist etc here.
haksi,Ranchi,Feb 2015,A great beach with a reasonably shallow shelf so that even non swimmers can bathe comfortably. Evenings come alive with the music from several eateries with bean bags and chairs to enjoy the place. You may get a lot of salesmen peddling their wares but they are not at all persistent so not a bother. The sunsets are really great to enjoy with a beer or coconut drink alongside.
sugiphang,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"how poor I am, even every years take 2-3 times for visit Bali but it's my first time going to Seminyak Beach that only a few from Kuta. So, was a great place for enjoy the sunset and there's so many beach club there. If you want to some cheaper beach club, you must going to double six or Gado Gado beach next to Anantara Resort. Perfect time for enjoy the Sunset is 17.30 to 19.00, but if you want get perfect seat at the clubs must going there before 17.00 would be crowd after that. The beach is clean and good wave for surfing, or you can riding a horse. Soccer and made some sand castle must be awesome. Will be back again "
roncon09,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Feb 2015,"Initially, it is pretty stunning and the water seemed nice. It was a bit disturbing to have plastic things floating around and latching on to my feet. It was more than a bit disturbing to see that someone(s) had just left their smoked cigarettes smashed out on the ground like the beach was their private ashtray. I know that the locals are combatting this with clean ups and I wish them luck. It was cool to see young students interviewing foreigners for their English school. It is nice that the place has a pleasant wholesome vibe. "
agarwalabhi,"Kingston, Saint Andrew, Jamaica",Feb 2015,Beach is good with some good restaurants overlooking the sea and sunset.Good time to go is around sun set.
RichardSa2014,"Bramley, UK",Jan 2015,"Covered in litter and totally unsafe to walk on, we found a used syringe. I was expecting beautiful beaches,so disappointed with waht we found. This is where Bali will fail as a tourist area."
barve,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,As beaches go it is nothing exceptional. We went in near the KuDeTa entrance and it was quite crowded. The beach is wide but nothing spectacular
Colin B,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2015,"We both love beaches and my trave partner liked Seminyak beach more than I did. He loved he vibe, especially at sunset where we stood by the trendy Ku De Ta bar with all the beautiful people. I agree about the good vibe, but I just found this beach rather dirty and grubby. Water like sludge, rubbish everywhere and people hassling you to buy their wares."
Kylie F,"Singleton, Australia",Feb 2015,The sun beds and umbrellas where a great touch on the beach but the rubish that had washed up onto the shore was not. Not the whole length of Seminyak beach was like this so take the time to walk along the beach to find the perfect spot. My son hired a boggy board from a local on the beach which he really injoyed.
Shayne S,"Golden Bay, Australia",Feb 2015,"The sunset bars and restaurants are a heavenly idea, the rubbish on the beach that washes up is disappointing, but the sunsets are amazing especially with a drink in hand.  Great place to people watch and see locals walk their dogs."
Xscape,99 contributions,Jan 2015,"Could have so much potential.  The trash just ruined it for me.  So sad and so bad, how do they get this in control.  Thousands of plastic straws in the sand and they had just finished raking the garbage with bull dozer.  Had to wear shoes to avoid cuts from garbage."
Blok45Serbia,"Belgrade, Serbia",Oct 2014,"Nowhere to hide from sun...Carefree children playing in the ocean, surfing, snorkling....Spotless endless sandy beach is like on a postcard. Waves are sometimes very big so you have to tace care of seaside signes"
johnmV2630SE,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"The Seminyak beach is a health hazard and should be closed immediately. I wanted to go in for a swim but it was just too dirty... some of the rubbish looked like medical waste? I overheard a Sydney guy say it was probably the dirtiest water he has ever seen. When I asked him what he did for a living he said, 'I am an inspector for Sydney Water.'"
Jameschang71,Shanghai,Jan 2015,"went to kuta, legian beach, but this one was ""cleanest"". Still obviously had garbage and hawkers. but better than others."
Daninsydney2065,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"The Ocean is full of plastic bits and pieces, rubbish floating and sticks to your body. Water was warm but really dirty. Tractors tried in vain to keep sand clean, to no avail. "
nedveddenise,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,"The view and less over-crowded. Not many people walking there. The restaurant, especially the Potato Head Bar is very good, though a little bit expensive."
19T-K91,"Middlesbrough, UK",Feb 2015,Busy but not loud - plenty of hawkers will harass you though but a firm no will get them to leave you alone. Very cheap loungers (25k for a day)
Jo D,33 contributions,Jan 2015,The beach doesn't compare with the beaches at home.  There was just too much rubbish around.  Wouldn't let the children walk around without shoes it was that bad.  The scoop and filter the sand but the problem is bigger than their present solution.
D Balduino C,"Rio das Ostras, RJ",Feb 2015,"Very nice beach, clean, with a lot of restaurants and all services. Great for a drink or dinner at sunset."
The.HoggerBlogger,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2014,There are a lot of beach side shacks which offer a lot of deals by which you get drinks and food for a cheaper price than that on the menu.
Vindav,"Mangalore, India",Jan 2015,Dirty beach unfit for swimming ....fit only for a walk....pity....with so may world class hotels on the beach.
bolts,"Austin, TX",Jan 2015,"This is our second visit in 3 years and the filth unfortunately got worse. If anything, I'd recommend walking along the beach an hour before sunset and settle in one of the cafes on the beach (Ku De Ta or Potato Head). It's still a beautiful sunset worth watching."
Calvin C,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,Very fantastic view to watch sunset.  Travel to Potato Head with beach wear to enjoy the sunset view at their pool.  Night time also a great place to enjoy the moon and stars after dinner!
Jack E,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"Very disappointed in what is claimed to be a 'beach'. By Australian standards this beach doesn't even rate; ugly black brown sand, refuse constantly being raked up by locals, serious feeling of absolute filth. Vendors of sun lounges and umbrellas all distant cousins of Arthur Daly, but with a lot less tact. Slightest hint of rain and they tip you out their sun lounge to save them from getting wet, weird?Footpath or motorbike 'highway' broken up in many places and dangerous for pedestrians.....but what do you expect, after all it is Bali............stay by the pool in your hotel is safer and more hygienic.........."
yesdes,Melbourne,Jan 2015,What's with all the rubbish. I found it disturbing to take walks on. Really needs a good clean and those businesses need to take some responsibility.
clau1228,"Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2015,"I was expecting to find a great beach with amazing waves,but what I really found was a huge beach full of rubbish! It was so disgusting! We tried to walk along the beach but it was just impossible, of course we did not get into this terrible water, when the wave was about to break we saw all the rubbish grrrrr terrible!"
LLAK,"London, UK",Jan 2015,"Although we visited during thundering monsoon rain and there were strong winds and some waves, it was still a beautiful beach."
pan613,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Very uninviting beach bit dirty and too rough for swimming.  maybe wrong time of year, but no beach paradise. Loved the corn from the corn seller in carpark beside beach, and enjoyed looking at the local temple"
TravellingHegge,"Red Deer, Canada",Jan 2015,"I've been told it was because of the rainy season, and it's the rain that brings it all in. I was also told it was still left over from new years eve. But I have never seen so much garbage on one beach in all my life! We referred to the beach as ""The Dump"""
duckyjim,"Polmont, UK",Dec 2014,"I have never been to such a dirty beach in my life. I can understand that the logs/wood comes down from the hills during the monsoon BUT why cant they clean it up. The rubbish along the whole stretch of this beach was disgusting, don't know how many nappies we counted, tried to go swimming and the plastic bags just wrap around your legs. I thought Bali was a paradise location, how wrong I was. NEVER again"
Fifibutterfly,11 contributions,Jan 2015,"loved the live music,cocktails,beanbags disliked the rubbish on the beachfront from neighbouring islands"
When-on-me-travels,"Stoke-on-Trent, UK",Nov 2014,"Myself and a few friends got a taxi to the beach from our hotel and had a light meal and a few beers along the beach. The beach was clean where we were and the sunset was impressive.We were hassled every 5mins by people selling scarfs, jewellery, frisbees and the like but we still had a decent evening."
Tarlie,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Jan 2015,"Seminyak Beach was very disappointing, the beach is full of rubbish which is washed up everyday. In the afternoons you can see locals walking along the beach going through the rubbish, some were even taking dead fish!.  The surf is dirty and rough not fit for swimming. Be careful when walking along this beach that you dont stand on something! The hotels along the beach are stunning and they do try and clean the areas in front of their hotels daily but it just washes up again the next day, very disapointing and sad to see such a beautiful place littered."
John H,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2015,Don't forget to stay on at the beach for evening meals and entertainment - much to do on Seminyak beach in front of Double 6 Hotel
Sandy P,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,"Yep, if you're visiting during wet season there will be rubbish on the beach. This washes down from all the creeks and rivers not just in Bali but across the sea and sadly lands on the S.W. facing beaches between Dec - March due to the currents. If you visit at other times the beaches are quite lovely. Try Googling The Great Pacific Garbage patch for truly depressing garbage information that is being created by all of us each each and every day.There was a concerted effort during our recent stay to try and clean up the garbage and debris each day but this a mammoth task that also requires considerable resources.So you wont perhaps be enjoying moonlit walks on the beach but the sunsets remain quite stunning and the beach is still a quick and easy gateway to some incredible dining and drinks options. Or visit between April and November !"
207LisaF,Seattle,Jan 2015,"Our recent stay (Jan. 2015) featured a beach strewn with trash, and too much wind to make for good surf. However, I have fond memories of surfing here in previous years with very little trash on the beach."
RMM1234,"Rose Bay, Australia",Jan 2015,Pollution is a problem but great to see on sunset when all the kids play on the beach. Ignore the people hawking their goods.
Sharron501,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,We went for morning walks but there was heaps of rubbish and dog poop to dodge. It would have been a lovely walk if not for that.
Rudi888,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2015,"Problem is litter. Our stay at Anantara Hotel meant we saw beach every day. Hotel cleaned it up each day but there were still plies of debris, eg wood and rubbish in heaps on beach. When you look into the water there is rubbish by the myriad and I'm not exaggerating. Plastic cups, bags, toys, bottles etc etc The pictures of pristine Bali beaches in Seminyak are not accurate. "
Nadia A,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",Jan 2015,"My family and I visited Seminyak Beach because it was within walking distance of the Courtyard Marriott, but we regretted it. There was trash everyone on the beach, mostly due to the rainy season and currents drawing the trash out and the waves returning it to the beach. The locals did try to clean it but it was pointless, really, as the ocean regurgitated it minutes later. Go to Jimbaran if you want to enjoy the beach."
BiaMonteiro78,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2015,"The beach was dirty, with all kinds of bottles, lighters, plastic, etc... on the sand.I didn't have the courage to go into the sea.If you want to enjoy good restaurants, bars, shops, beach clubs, then it's a good alternative, like Potato Head beach club, Ku de Ta, and several other restaurants, bars, shops, massage spas along the main street."
Thomwayn,Canada,Jan 2015,"If you visit Seminyak, you MUST catch at least one sunset on the beach! Be sure to arrive about 30 minutes-1 hour before sunset as it can get crowded and things happen quite quickly. I sat near the Potato Head Beach Club along the shore and watched as the sun quickly sank behind the clouds. The colours were indescribable and the view was breathtaking! So amazing! The lucky people who live and work there get a treat like that everyday. I went during low-season so it wasn't too crowded. I highly recommend Seminyak Beach if you're in Bali!"
Raffster58,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Despite the hard work of locals every day trying to clean up the waste and refuse, I have never on a daily basis seen a beach so dirty and disgusting and waste strewn from the water line right to the road. if you want a first hand picture of how we are destroying our planet and our environment, come to Seminyak beach. Dead rotting fish, dog faeces, plastic containers and an assortment of rubbish. What a real shame!"
567CAT,"Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia",Jan 2015,The beach was dirty and lots of dead fish on the shore they tried to  clean it up but then left piles of rubbish every where.
Forever an Islander,Philippines,Jan 2015,"As I've spent my whole life in SE Asia, I can say I have seen many filthy and ugly beaches but Kuta Beach beats them all. I was in Kuta during a stop over and I decided to walk to the beach...OMG...what a sad sight. There were mountains of rubbish and garbage accumulated on the shore at every 20 meters...With a terrible traffic and a heavily polluted road just a few steps away...I was shocked to find out that so many people actually do go to such an ugly place. Weird."
sandy f,"Mandurah, Australia",Jan 2015,"In front of Champlung Cafe look on the beach for Ruddy, Rocky,Made and Eka. They are the nicest people who a always give a reasonable price and will remember you next time.made has great silver rings and ruddy does a great deal on bangles and belts. tell them Sandy & Barry says hello from Perth"
Adam B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,It is sad to see such a splendid stretch of beach absolutely covered with rubbish. The rains wash out the drains resulting in a filthy deposit all the way down the coast - except where exclusive resorts or restaurants have paid cleaners to clear up! One of our party even saw schoolchildren participating in the cleanup WITHOUT gloves! Yuk. Don;t even think about swimming - the crest of each wave consists of floating plastic!
Lemario1976,"Townsville, Australia",Jan 2015,"Sewers discharging straight into the beach, mountains of garbage, dead carcasses of birds filled with plastics.... lost for words. We spent the days swimming in our hotel pool and went to the water parks, avoid at all costs as surely future visitors to Bali will begin doing in droves"
Subra01,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,The colours if the sky as the turn from blue to yellow to orange to deep red and finally dark was amazing as the sun set over this beach.For a off-season it was reasonably cordedHowever it wasn't as clean as Seminyak or as I expected
Annie M,Melbourne,Jan 2015,"the beach at Seminyak is disgusting,full of garbage and defiantly not clean.We swam at our Villa most of the time.As for sunset avoid the ""IN"" spots they are over priced and over rated"
Latoya V,19 contributions,Jan 2015,"It's cool to sit and have a drink after the sun goes down, because then you can't see the heavily-littered beach. It's really depressing to see that rubbish on the shore. :("
Mark M,3 contributions,Jan 2015,"It is an absolute tragedy what humans do to this planet. Seminyak beach is an example, with rubbish not only covering the beach but plenty in the water. If you like going for a swim at a rubbish dump then this is for you. The Indonesian people really need to wake up and start looking after one of their best assets. Tourists also need to remember to clean up after themselves! It's a shame, I wounder when people will change."
David B,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,"Filthy, smelly, terrible access. Very disappointed. Don't go to Bali for the beaches. Overrated and not worth it..."
DanChavo,"Madrid, Spain",Dec 2014,In december there were few people so that we have a lovely morning in the sea. The waves made funnier our stay at the beach. The weather was fantastic.
no bs yogi,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"The beach was covered in rubbish & the water was brown.  The sand was very grainy, it's appearance was greyish & it smelt terrible."
milletim,Kuala Lumpur,Jan 2015,Some of the most amazing sunsets you will ever witness in your life.  We made it a point to watch the sunset every night with a drink and just reflect on each wonderful day.
VTik,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2015,Pro :- Nice long beach.  Ocean view.  Pretty scenic.- Lots of restaurants and shops fronting the beach.Con :- It's a thrash heap during the rainy monsoon season (Dec/Jan) as the rain brings all the rubbish from the rivers to the beachside.... making it unsightly and smelly!
TaurangaDancer,Tauranga,Jan 2015,The beaches are beautiful but sadly covered in rubbish. There are masses of cafes and its lovely sitting on the beach but the swimming is not recommended- poluted. We ended up travelling to Uluwatu to swim
8mmSA,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2015,"Apparently December is the Seminyak Beach, Trash Expo. An annual phenomenon where the currents bring in all our rubbish to this beach. Rubbish we humans failed at handling correctly . See the pictures... This place could be paradise, if we humans every cleaned up our act... but in Seminyak beach, I saw hell... Rather go to Nusa Dua beach, but please. I beg you, don't destroy this place too... Throw  your litter in the trash, not in the gutters and streets... Stop killing this beautiful country..."
Surfinghunty,West Sussex,Dec 2014,"Considering that the beauty of this place is the main asset, as a visitor, you are left in disbelief that the locals would allow this place to be spoilt by us.  We hired surfboards and had a good surf, but this was definitely affected by the plastic bags and waste that wrapped themselves around our legs as we battled out into the surf..!  If you choose to sit on the beach, then prepare yourself for one of the more committed examples of high-pressure selling that I have ever experienced, but I guess that goes with the territory.  In a nut shell, probably best to go somewhere else for an unspoilt experience."
Leontko,Singapore,Dec 2014,"This was a much better place to chill out than Kuta beach. A much smaller crowd here which equated to a more peaceful time at the beach. At the same time, there were enough people to give it a lively feel (not deserted). The waves here were pretty strong and surfing was difficult for a beginner like my friend and I. We were barely able to paddle out far enough to catch a wave without getting batted back (around the afternoon period). There were also cafes and bars littered around the beach (unlike Kuta, where you had to get out of the beach) thus, it was very convenient to just grab a bite or drink. Definitely a much better beach to visit than Kuta. "
Padraigmacroom,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Seminyak beach is a beautiful stretch of water with so every good restaurants along its shore including LaLucciola,Breeze and Ku DeTa. La Lucciola is probably the prettiest with great sea views and not much beach litter.As you walk back along the beach to main part of seminyak the beach litter bamboo poles and plastic litter is staggering. The water is unfit to swim in. It is equally dangerous for surfers with large pieces of wood floating or semi submerged which is really dangerous. Western facing beaches are subject to this after tropical storms with east coast beaches not affected as badly. The locals are trying really hard to control this pollution but much more needs to be done."
Joel,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2015,A more peaceful beach just a bit North of Kuta. Not too many hawkers and the beach seems a lot cleaner than the Legian/Kuta Beach area.
freedomwheels289,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"visited 6 or 7 of the beachside bars for relaxing sunset drinks, it was great way to spend several afternoons and amazingly the music , something as a couple in our 40's could listen too."
DoBeAdventure,"Peachland, Canada",Jan 2015,"The beauty of the beach is the length of it and accessibility. The downside....big downside, is the garbage on the beach every morning and worse after a rain. They do have a tractor with a pickup that is out during the day but it seems the garbage is never ending.  Very sad to experience.  On the positive, the beach bars are a great place to visit in the afternoon as they have entertainment daily during happy hour."
Denise K,"Lake Macquarie, Australia",Jan 2015,"The beach was filthy due to recent heavy rains and rubbish washed up, we weren't their for the beach though as we went Nusa Dua to have a lovely day at a clean beach!"
Margie F,"Kogarah, Australia",Jan 2015,"We had heard a lot about Seminyak prior to going to go to Bali, however the black was so disappointing. It was covered in pollution.  The rubbish was some of the worst I have ever seen on a beach anywhere in the world.  I would be very annoyed to have paid good money to stay at these great beachside hotels on,y to have this mess and smell out the front of the hotel. Stay away, head to Nusa Dua if you want somewhere in a nice hotel with a good Bea h out the front."
Dolphindream,"Byron Bay, Australia",Oct 2014,Great Walking and Surfing Beach - swimming only for experienced strong swimmers.Early Morning Walks along the Beach you get a sense of the Real Balinese way of Life before the Travellers wake up !
KDB888,"Ballarat, Australia",Jan 2015,"I walked from potato head to Ku De Ta and would sum up the experience simply by saying it is very sad. The beach is putrid with pollution- washed up debris, plastics etc. it is astonishing filthy, this being blamed on the rainy season and rubbish from the rivers. There was no one out swimming and one can only hope that there is a real clean up process and that it is much much better at other times of the year."
Daryl O,5 contributions,Nov 2014,"Great bean bags on the beach , cold beer, terrific mixture of cuisine and we love the hawkers for a bartering session."
Avinash N,"pune , india",Dec 2014,"I have been to Nusa dua ( All five star property beaches) Sanur ( For those who dont like to enter the sea, but want to see the sea) Kuta ( Surfers and Kids jumping around, + Crowded) amongst the most tourist friendly beaches . I vote for Seminyak beach as this has all that a true Beach Connoisseur wants.Quiet , Beach Chairs + Umbrella ( 25-30,000 ) per person per day if u bargain) cool beer , acceptable food like pizza or nasi goereng, fried rice) , soft sand , great waves and best views for Sunset.You can walk in the evening on the beach from your hotel in Seminayak to Kuta or Legian beach and cross over to the Party side and restaurants in Kuta . The walk is 40 min and has great views. "
Florian254,Norddeutschland,Nov 2014,"There is hotel afetr hotel and bar after bar at this beach so it is seldom empty. The public entrances are few and far between but worth going there in any case. Spectacular sunsets and nice (if very, very warm) sand. Lot¬¥s of dealers walking along.For swimming basically forget it. I am an experienced swimmer and within 5 days I managed to get in only twice, the waves are very good for surfing but not for swimmers.And for all people not used to it: This red colour on somebody¬¥s elses skin may be the same one as the one on yours. Be aware."
dip69,"Launceston, Australia",Jan 2015,"White sand? Where? The sand is grey and dirty. If you try wallk in the water you want to make sure you walk at least ankle deep or you will walk on bits of rubbish, including what looked like condoms and needle covers. You cannot take a decent beach walk because streams run across the beach into the sea and they are of very questionable cleanness so you don't really want to walk through them in case of catching some illness. As for the bars, if you want to sit in big groups of people sitting close together, this might be your scene.  I couldn't really see anything to rave about. There are much better places in bali than this."
sarafschroder3,"Columbus, OH",Jan 2015,This was by far the most disgusting beach I've ever seen. It literally looked like a garbage dump. The beach was covered in trash that had washed up from anywhere and everywhere. There are a few bars that are worth a visit where they've obviously cleaned up the sand but otherwise don't go. it has the potential to be amazing so hopefully it gets cleaned up. 
Gabi Borella,"Dee Why, Australia",Dec 2014,"Really dirty beach, but provides an amazing sunset! Grab a place at La Plancha and enjoy a couple of Bintangs and Croquetis while watching it!"
Adriankelly P,"Rockhampton, Australia",Jan 2015,was very disappointed with seminyak beach - if you looking for good beaches head to nusa dua or sanur areas it much nicer
Anthony B,"Cunderdin, Australia",Dec 2014,Some dayes the beach was fab but then other days you couldent moove on the beah becouse of the rubbish
Kerri S,Jakarta,Dec 2014,"Christmas and New Year are definitley a big hit in Seminyak, however don't expect clean beaches this time of year as the North winds bring in trash and wood from all over making it literally impossible to enjoy the beaches and the smell the garbage brings with it. September is a much better time to coem to these beaches"
Paul K,"Atlanta, GA",Jan 2015,"Great place to watch the fireworks, the people, dance, drink and ring in the new year.  Not the disco scene down by Kuta but very fun and more low key (but hardly quiet)."
SO1975,"Berlin, Germany",Dec 2014,"I love Bali, but please don't go there for the beach. They have to do something about the waste coming in and keep the beach clean as otherwise this will have an impact sooner or later."
Lyn M,12 contributions,Dec 2014,Seminyak beach has a great atmosphere and is not as busy as Kuta beach. Enjoyed sitting in one of the beach bungalow bars having an afternoon drink and watching the people go by. Lots of fun.
Huimineology,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"I visited in December, a week before Christmas and the beach wasn't filled with litters (maybe yet). The crowd generally sets in after 5pm, before that, the beach was less crowded and more serene. It was a rainy season but managed to catch the sunset on a good day. Street stalls are lined just outside the entrance to the beach, with the Satay tasting good."
josiewolff,3 contributions,Dec 2014,Debris washes up on the beach everyday you can't swim at the beach. Lovely beach but there is a lot of rubbish. They need to clean it up
Eoin C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"Very nice beach with some hassles from people trying to sell you stuff non stop, although this is to be expected. The view is great so I recommend asking one of the locals selling beer if you can hire/borrow some chairs from them and then relax and enjoy the great service and cheap beer. The locals are very friendly and the beers go down a treat."
SooKen,Kuala Lumpur,Jan 2015,"I've been to beautiful Bali many times over the years but this is the first time I've seen such a shockingly filthy beach in all my beach holidays across Asia. It is such a sad state Bali is in and what tourism has done to it. Real drastic measures need to be taken urgently by the government, tourism industry and local communities to save the beaches of Bali."
Jen,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Good for surfing, but beach dirty. Drains going out into the sea is smelly. Great for a nice long walk or jog along the beach. Woudn't lay on the beach though. Gets windy. Dogs everywhere. Offerings scattered everywhere in the wind. "
read_e_2go,brisbane,Dec 2014,"The sunset was beautiful, but the litter on the beach is sad to witness - it has to be cleaned up daily by a tractor."
Maurice M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,It is almost impossible to walk along the beach as you are literally wading thru tons of rubbish that is washed up each day - totally disgusting!!
Kathy C,"Amherst, NY",Jan 2015,"We went during rainy season, a lot of debris was on the beach and he water was so polluted we did t go in, we went to kuta beach also and. The same, tons of sand fleas, I got eaten alive."
tonyoneteam,"London, UK",Dec 2014,"Stayed at a hotel on the beach, love this breach, cleaned daily, lots of beds, bars at night and great for sunset walks."
Erika F,51 contributions,Jun 2014,"We were expecting a relaxing beach vacation in Seminyak before we headed inland into Ubud. Sadly, the beaches in this area are extremely touristy and dirty. There is a lot of trash on the beach. You will also get hassled by vendors trying to sell you things as well as women who will just go ahead and start touching you wanting you to pay for a massage. If you are looking to relax on the beach with a good book and not be interrupted, this is not the beach for you. There are many nice restaurants and cafe's along this beach and it is fun at night when they all bring out their bean bags to have a drink. I would suggest to venture south to more beautiful beaches!"
Swethashekar18,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Dec 2014,Good thing here is that they clean the shore everyday. Coz i am not aware of any beaches being cleaned any where i have visited.
Raitman,Port Moresby,Dec 2014,Really good surf and great beach for sunset watching. However there was no beach path you could follow
michelb-chantalv,Canada,Nov 2014,you will pay if you want to have a chair or sunbed for any length of time.many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach
Brent H,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2014,"At the time of year we travelled, December, the beach is pretty average - dark sand, rubbish everywhere from the monsoons and pretty average.. Not worth it, spend time at your villa!"
Shane Zieck,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Great location and always fun to be at but this time the rubbish washed onshore was so bad it rendered the beach as unusable. Still, we'll be back!"
Dean H,"Clarkson, Australia",Jan 2015,"Full of rubbish and debris and although they had tractors operating to clear it, they couldn't keep up with it, it is such a shame as it wasn't this bad when we visited before ."
Mick H,"Annandale, Australia",Jan 2015,This is my first time back in Bali in 20 years and I'm sad to say it's not changed for the better!The beach was litter strewn all along the 10 minute walk we took with large piles of garbage everywhere.  The government really need to do something about this if they are serious about tourism as I certainly won't be rushing back again!
Cee,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,"Watching the sun set is a must! It's beautiful, pictures will not do justice. Beach is a bit dirty with rubbish (there are people raking it up)"
GlennDias,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2014,"Crowded, dirty but entrtaining. Great lunch at Chez Gado Gado sitting out on their beach front terrace."
lozelizabeth87,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"It was pleasant. Water not ideal for swimming when hot as the oranisms in the water are unsafe. Nice for a cocktail, walk and tanning."
MichaelToose,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"i've been to Bali a few times, this my first in the wet. If you're coming for a beach holiday avoid this time of year as the beach is gross. Other times it has been fine.Still can't go wrong with a beer in the bean bags at sunset (when you can't see the trash)"
237nikkid,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"We first approached the beach at Seminyak with excitement and anticipation only to be greeted by rubbish littering the sand and a fear that we might step on something dangerous! I couldn't help but think that if this is supposed to be one of Bali's premier beaches someone has to do something about the garbage. There were small groups of Oberoi staff gathering trash into little piles but it was an impossible task.....and so disappointing! I know we are spoiled for beautiful beaches in Australia but if Bali tourism is to be sustainable into the future, something has yo be done about the rubbish, recycling and environmental care."
Phase N,7 contributions,Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are awful and this one is no different. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourists come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. There is also polluted water that seriously smells like sewerage flowing into the ocean and kids play in it!! I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are still pristine paradise so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc. I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer. This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person. All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions. These bars also seem to be populated with pretentious people staring at their smart devices and taking selfies particularly 'la Plancha'. You're better off buying some bin tangs and go further up where there are no bars and enjoy the sunset on a towel with some quiet."
DeeDee781,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,I liked all the restaurants along the beach.  There was a lot to choose from and well priced.  Harris hotel provided their own chairs
tutu_10,"Washington DC, DC",Dec 2014,"The beach was pretty to look at, the water was nice and warm, but some areas quite polluted.  The beach in front of Kudeta smelled a little of sewage runoff."
Glenn,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,This beach is clean and much more quiet than the beach at Kuta. We enjoyed the umbrella offered and the drinks served at the chairs provided
Robert T,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Dec 2014,This is a very good beach. Could be great. The town effluent that runs into the beach is one big downer. Pretty sure that raw sewage is in that effluent river that runs between the Oberoi and the lifeguard station then another just south of Luna2. Install a proper sewage system and change public dumping attitudes and this beach would be unforgettable. 
David K,"London, England, United Kingdom",Dec 2014,"Plastic, bottles, glass, crap in the sea and on the beach.  Even the bars that rely on the beach for income have thrown dud glass lightbulbs onto the beach. Rivers flowing into the sea smell of suplhur.  It needs huge effort now to make this a safe nice place to be.  Don't come."
Ari S,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"Bit dirty with a lot of rubbish on the beach. The only thing letting it down in my opinion. Surf was fine for me, but a bit for children"
Cheree N,"Greater Wellington, New Zealand",Nov 2014,"very busy, great sunsets, dirty around the edges and beware of constant beach hawkers selling all manner of stuff you dont need or want"
WillN55,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,"You have to try la Plancha's Friday evening sundowners on the beanbags! Best time for swimming, depending on tides, is early in the morning.  Be aware that the Balinese surf lifesavers have limited skills and resources.  Swim where you are in control, and between the red and yellow flags."
SRNMH,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2014,"I went there with my husband for honeymoon and stayed at Yubi Villa. We went to seminyal beach around 6pm to see the sunset. It was pretty nice view. It wasour first time there. We were standing in the middle of the sand and suddenly a normal wave came in and we taught it won't reach us. But shockingly, it reach to our knee level. The depth of the water is dangerous if you were to bring your small children.  Overall the place is awesome!"
Amanda J,"Geelong, Australia",Nov 2014,"okay, but as an Aussie not outstanding, not really my kind of beach, villa pool was better, cleaner and more relaxing"
Melissa R,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"relaxing and just beautiful at sunset, the locals we hospitable and entertaining also scored some good bargains from local vendors"
Jeremy055,"Cambridge, UK",Dec 2014,"Beach in December 2014 was awash with plastic and litter every day. It was disgusting. The water was full of plastic bags, labels and bottles. The litter is washed down from the hills in the rivers and much of it also comes from Java "
Bathawk,"Johannesburg , South Africa",Dec 2014,Unfortunately the beach becomes very dirty due the the trash washing in to the ocean when it rains. But on so he days it was very clean and a wonderful beach to spend the day on. Beach loungers are available for rent. Many restaurants are available .some surfing schools offer lessons.
Malta_explorer,"Bromley, UK",Dec 2014,Seminyak beach was probably the dirtys beach I've ever been to. It's a shame because the place has so much potential. But a stroll in the evening will bring you across lots of plastic and rubbish strewn all across the beach. I wouldn't go swimming there.
Bintang Soepoetro,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"i like it since it nearby to my hotel. Children loved it also. Although it was crowded, but the beach was clean"
rydawav01,"Los Angeles, California",Nov 2014,"Large, clean, you can rent surf or paddle boards anywhereLots of restaurants & shops on the water frontTry to avoid the solicitors on the beach"
NitinMit,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Nov 2014,"Nice, crowded beach with lot of shacks. You can also do surfing here. Certainly not a quite beach if thats what you are looking for. Good beach for night walk as you can see the city lights that time. "
Mik W,"Croydon, UK",Dec 2014,"Its a good stretch of beach with some cool bars etc at the side where you can eat/drink on comfy seats under umbrellas but even though I saw people collecting litter there is rubbish strewn everywhere, with no bins to cut down on this, and the hawkers get on your nerves."
Lynley T,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2014,"I always enjoy a chilled Bintang on the beach at the bottom of Jl. Drupadi, so took a friends from L.A. to enjoy the sunset and general ambience.   Very disappointing compared to previous visits.   The beer wasn't chilled and when I told the 'beach boy', he just shrugged.   Not to be deterred, we took our beers to the ""Food Hut"" for the mandatory Sate's, which were excellent.However, when I went to pay the Bill they wanted to charge me for the beer TWICE!   I pointed out that we ordered on the Beach, but carried them up the stairs to finish with our meal.   One of the Waiters was adamant that he had given us a second beer with our meal.   The ""Cash desk"" checked the 'chits' and of course, we had only had 1 beer each.So, be aware...  "
Bernie Z,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2014,"I ve been for a jog in the morning around 6am. It was a ride between trash, plastic bags, flip flops... Tourist should come early to see that. Luck some truck clean that before most of the people arrive. A real shame."
Saakshi J,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2014,"Semniyak beach is full of life, with lots of beach facing bean bag joints having good food, drinks and live music. There are some vendors selling tatoos, cosmetics, trinklets, coconut water and offering massages. We walked from Semniyak beach to legian to kuta beach and Semniyak definitely seems cleaner and having better crowd, more limited to guests staying at beach properties. Kuta beach had lots of local people playing on the beach and stalls etc. so was much more crowded. Sea water is not that clean in Legian, Semniyak and Kuta. Waves are quite high but its still safe enough to go in the water waist deep or so... "
nagesh g,"Doha, Qatar",Feb 2014,Seminyak Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach...grt spot to surf & sunbath & if you wanna a cheap reflexology trust me its worth i after getting stressed on the beach
GlobalFrequentFlyer1,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,Beach was pretty dirty which is a shame. There are sun beds that you can rent for about $50K for 1 hour which is great. Swim between the flags... but there are not a lot of lifesavers...
AneliyaBG,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Sep 2014,"Beautiful beach :) Perfect for a walk, big and not crowded.When we went there the water came unexpectedly and take away my flip-flops from the sand, which were next to me - under the sun umbrella :DAfter 2 hours we had to walk 5 mins to get into the water. The waves has been so big. It's great for surfers, but watch out, because there were few broken surfboards.The sunset was the most beautiful I have ever seen. If you go there just for sunbathing don't miss it and wait to see it."
Birt1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,Too much rubbish on the beach - great to watch from a distance such as the Kudeta or Breeze Restaurant but up close not a patch on an Aussie beach.
YewMoon,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"I'm not a beach person; I really prefer mountains anytime.  Still, if there's a beach I don't mind spending time at, it'd be Seminyak in the low season.It wasn't crowded but neither was it desolate.  You could relax (once you've made clear what you wanted and didn't want from the vendors) but there's always a pulsating beat somewhere to remind you of partying.And though none of the sunsets I saw was spectacular (it being cloudy in December), they were beautiful in their own ways."
diane cunningham,Edinburgh,Dec 2014,It's not the best beach in the world and could be cleaner though the hotels along it do clean up their bits but it's great for a refreshing breeze while walking in the sea to cool off. You can swim but the waves can be a bit strong.
JJ R,"Makati, Philippines",Dec 2014,"I like long walks on beaches and Seminyak Beach is a place for me.I like the feel of the wind in my face, the sand on my feet, and the sounds of the waves crashing in. Nice place for ""me time or my time alone"". Also nice to have friends to chat with.A definite place to visit more than once.The big plus factor is that the vendors are not aggressive and will not bother you once you say ""no"".  Go to this beach!"
MerryMegsy,"Lara, Australia",Nov 2014,Seminyak beach is the cool beach in Bali! Along the beach you'll find a heap of trendy restaurants and bars where you can lay back on a beach lounge/beanbag and enjoy the sunset.The sunset in Bali is just beautiful! And relaxing having a few drinks whilst watching the sunset was certainly a highlight for us!We also enjoyed walking along Seminyak beach during the day. We did not swim at the beach as our hotel was in Legian so we swam further down.
Bruno Wolf,"Villefranche-sur-Mer, France",Dec 2014,"This morning i walked on both directions of Seminyak beach and was truly shocked about so much dirt, trash, plastic bags and goblets, thousands of dead fish and dogs left overs etc.Nobody really seems to care that the people here cut of the tree they are sitting on !I have seen many beaches during my extensive travel life but this almost topped it all.If the authorities would take only one dollar from each arriving tourist per day for the purpose of environemental clean up, instead of the stupid airport tax, they could buy as many of the beach cleaning trucks as they need.The only clean parts of the beach were the ones managed by the more caring hotels. And even there, they had to clean it manually which is not so fun for the people that have to do it. There are not trash bins anywhere. I was reading a comment about the rituals on the beach and i actually saw one which was nice to see. But after i returned to that arey, the people had left with tue usual trash piles. Dreadful !They should remind themselves from time to time that tourists have choices and can spend their vacation and their money elsewhere very easily !"
Muhamad Hanif Asaari,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Nov 2014,Go here early in the morning. It was a beautiful beach to jog & not so crowded. you will definitely enjoy the morning breeze
Aleasha N,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2014,So much rubbish and dog poop everywhere.. plus all the people trying to sell you the same thing over and over.. yuck.  Guess i am spoilt for choice with Australian beaches..
Titzi09,"Newport Beach, CA",Dec 2014,The beach is fairly clean. We went for long walks every morning. The sunsets were beautiful. Along the beach there are many bars and restaurants so you have many choices for eating on the water.
Brooke D,34 contributions,Nov 2014,"A lot of trash on the beach, not the most pleasant of sights!  Could have been that it is the wet season, but even so!Didn't swim there, didn't feel the need!"
Melissahoworth,Indonesia,Dec 2014,I love this beach in fact we had our hen night and stag do in this beach! We always visit cristal palace. It sells amazing cocktails and the food they serve is pretty good. 
holidayjan,Brisbane,Nov 2014,"What a lovely place to relax at sunset with a Bintang beer, do not however buy from the beach sellers as I did and was hounded by all the rest of them there after. Lol"
traveldoc009,"Amritsar,",Nov 2014,"Its one of the finest stretch of beaches you see. A long picturesque beach with sufficient space for everyone to unwind. Its not crowded either. With lovely resorts in the background adding to its charm. The undercurrent is strong, so not for swimmers. Maintenance however could be better and some garbage can be seen around. Still its a piece of sheer beauty."
2010TheGoodLife,"Union City, CA",Dec 2014,"Good beach however hard to access as the beach is covered with hotels and restaurants that require you to access the beach by having to go through the restaurant. Vendors selling sunglasses, hats, necklaces, etc. on the beach along with a couple shops for surfboard rentals. "
IAN K,40 contributions,Oct 2014,"Lots of people go for the sunset so can get quite busy, food and drink stalls available. Bars close by become busier after sunset and many require a reservation."
Santeena D,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Getting toward the end of my holiday I booked into a hotel close to the beach.Walking along the beach in the morning staff set up umbrella's and lounge chairs, so colour full and people soon gathered.I walked  up the beach Ifound many bars/restaurants, all offering breakfast at good prices.People watching was fantastic, travelling alone it's amazing what you notice. around 5.30 I found myself down there for sunset.Staff had changed the lounge sun beds foe bright coloured bean bags, flage and lots of lighting was getting put up. I choose a spot and relaxed, great people all around, so much happening, dinner was great, picked a different one each night, same same but different ...  I would walk back up to my hotel maybe 10min and always felt safe. watching a sunset there at Seminyak beach I felt truly Blessed..."
sidakumar,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2014,"This is not a swimming beach. the surf in late november was rough and everywhere you see warning signs. not a chill-on-a-recliner, get drunk and take a dip kind of beach."
Amanda N,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,I have just returned from staying at Double-Six Hotel and I must say that I was so impressed that the beach had been cleaned up and free of all the rubbish that flooded it last year.  The restaurants are yummy and clean and the Bintag's always cold!  
Fran R,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"Beach was clean and easy to get 2,the traffic was some what scary when trying to cross road.The shops on eat street were amazing,so you always spent time checking out what was in store."
Di P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"You can't beat this place for sunset drinks, the staff are always helpful and the cocktails are yummy."
SharonChong,"Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia",Nov 2014,"i llove the view, and i love the dogs around there. It make it a most beautiful picture after all............................."
Mshohoho,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,Liked how it wasn't crowded at all on the weekdays. We had space to ourselves and it was peaceful. Sand was fine and water clear. Disliked how we had to pay to use a beach chair to park our things. Travel light. Bring a beach mat of your own.
B4r4cud4,"Clonakilty, Ireland",Oct 2014,"very nice beach tidy and big waves..nice food in a local beach restaurant..you can have a bed there for 50 000 Rp/day (3,5 euro) near the local famous bar."
DanJAie,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"Very nice beach, much much cleaner than Kuta, more peaceful established crowd and less pesky vendors"
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Plenty of water activities.  Bars and restaurants close by.  Clean, organised beach.The usual beach hawkers but they don't hassle you.  A polite no with a smile is all you need."
HaDWill,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Much better than the over rated Jurian Bay, Loved the laid back and relaxed vibe, great fun with kids"
Ella Dvornik,"London, UK",Nov 2014,Really pretty beach lots of bars and restaurants around...the sea is warm and sand I lovely. Lots of waves rolling in distance and amazing sunset. What can I say except heaven on earth... Sometimes ruined by screaming Australians.
Vicky S,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,They are grading the beach each day so was nice and clean.  They had flags to swim between if you are not a strong swimmer and the water was nice and clear.  The sand is a little grey but not unpleasant.
Channii,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Sep 2014,Nothing great was just like any other beach lots of people hassling you to come have a look at their stuff to buy
expat_brit_9,"Blairgowrie, UK",Nov 2014,"The surf here was good and safe for body boarding. The beach was clean and you could rent sun loungers off the local people for a reasonable price. They also rent boards and you buy extremely cheap beer from them. There are lots of sellers of sarongs, hats, watches etc, but most of them were not pushy!"
Alilen,"Damascus, Oregon",Nov 2014,"Warm gorgeous blue water. Shallow a long way out. While not the worst we've seen in our travels it is sad to see such a lovely beach with so much plastic and litter. ""Hawkers"" selling trinkets, ice cream, fruit etc were overall friendly. If you were not interested a simple but firm ""no thank you"" was sufficient. On average about 50,000 reps for beach chairs for 2 for two people the day. "
Maureen S,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"The beach was lovely but nothing out of the ordinary when compared to Australian beaches.  It was lovely to sit in the restaurant and watch the sunset, but would not go out of my way to swim there."
Nmdtech,Canada,Aug 2014,Plenty of space to walk and relax. beware of the waves though.at night the beach becomes a lounge. You'll see.
Chantal M,"Bangkok, Thailand",Nov 2014,"Great spot for sunsets, but not ideal for swimming, strong current. There are many hotels you can go sit and enjoy the view along the walk or street vendors have set up lounges for you to lie on for a price."
ClaireT410,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2014,"The beach has a breathtaking view of the sunset. It is a great place to relax. There are a lot of vendors approaching you trying to sell stuff, but they dont tag along once you refuse politely. A lot of restaurants along the beach are quite nice."
Achmad Maulana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"the seminyak as many people know as the luxury villa located close to the beach, offered luxury items sell along the street, as the place as well location  for many famous restaurant and resort, however many of the guest di di not know that the seminyak is the place for turtle sanctuary as the black sandy beach there are the home for green turtle nesting and sanctuary as well as laying their eggs"
Steve P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Wide expanses, great view and a few people but not much.. Hit the beach bars with music, bean bags and Bintang. Great service - you still get the odd sales person but who doesnt need a massage and hair braids"
Marty0010,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"Hot, like everywhere. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy the heat if you are a sun lover. Beautiful sunset.  Then nightlife on the beach. Is a must- live duet and beanbags, toes in soft sand.  Love it!"
dg3225,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2014,"The beach is honky tonky but you know that if you are coming to this beach.  Lots of massage, and vendors always on top of you pushing their stuff.  Great food, night life is good and people are in great spirits here.  Just a fun place."
Ramburgers,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Nov 2014,All brown and yukky..didn't even go swimming...there were ppl annoying you to buy things everywhere and no signs or anything to show you where to exit the beach. Not good for kids at all.
Pamela J,"Durham, England, United Kingdom",Nov 2014,Beach was very clean and able to walk miles along the beach. Need shoes or flip flops as the sand gets red hot. Surfers paradise but difficult if you are not a good swimmer. The hotel has a life guard on duty and warning flags are displayed on the beach
Ben P,"Fishkill, NY",Jun 2014,"Basically there is Kuta to the south, Legian in the middle, and Seminyak beach to the north. Seminyak beach is the quiet one, although quiet is relative because in July/August it is also full of tourists. If you don't like crowded beach I suggest to visit in June like me, or September."
Barry A,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Nov 2014,"Good beach with lots of good quality cafes nearby for a snack or meal,  and great spot to watch the sunset and have a quiet drink. Locals seem to like it too."
Balloot,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,"Nice clean beach close to the major hotels/villas in Seminyak. Also, there are a fair number of dining options nearby. Chairs can be expensive, so make sure to negotiate them down, don't take the first offer. Surf is rough, but there is a lifeguard. There were lots of people in the water, but should be careful with children or inexperienced swimmers.Overall very good, but not the most picturesque beach, hence only 4 stars."
thedoctor4646,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,It was alot cooler on the beach and its nice to see families playing here and the sunset was lovely however its dirty and the water is unclean . We walked along the beach to get to Ku de Ta and had to walk across 2 wide creeks that reaked of effluent.
imgod2,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,"The Seafood is average tasting, nothing fantastic about it. Wear sandals and use a decent toilet before going there."
Blue_Man_Alejandro,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,The locals advised that Seminyak beach is a great place to catch the Bali sunset as compared to Kuta beach (if you have kids). It's just far less crowded and rowdy in Seminyak as compared to in Kuta. We went to Potato Head without reservations and couldn't get a table in time for the sunset so we gave that a miss and went to the beach instead. 
Ameniavella,Malta,Oct 2014,"It was beautiful, clean and the bars and restaurants scattered around contribute to the lovely atmosphere there!"
925archer,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"Beaches on the west coast tend to be quite rough and many had flags out saying swimming prohibited.  Lots of daybeds with umbrellas around to hire (about $2 or $3 AUS per day).  Beach sands were mainly volcanic, nice and dark."
EllenAndySoo,"Singapore River, Singapore",Oct 2014,Love to watch the sunset there!!! Indeed beautiful!!! And also can watch big waves!!! CAn go for surf!!!
Katerina K,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,"Beach is nice. The only thing I didn't like was the locals trying to sell u products. However, if you step on the green grass where the hotels are, they are not permitted to follow"
Jane B,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2014,Lovely looking out at the beach from local restaurants. Not too good for swimming due to strong rip.
monalizzahl,The Netherlands,Apr 2014,"I love Seminyak Beach <3. come often here just to watch the sunset, walking along the beach watching people riding horse (if ure lucky ;)). i love to spend my evening time in Seminyak beach and double six beach.."
Kazipooz,Benalla,Nov 2014,very nice to watch the sunset and have a few drinks in the bean bags. We just had pizza and drinks on the bean bags - service was excellent and didn't get bothered to much by sellers.
Sav01,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Nov 2014,Must have dinner on the beach in the bean bags for the sunset here and the locals don't bug you like they used to 
Trequier,"Hobart, Australia",Oct 2014,"We had a fantastic view to watch the sun setting from Chez Gado Gado, while enjoying a couple of cocktails and snacks.  We then walked along the beach and it was such a lovely spot, to see everyone was having a good time. "
Barneswallisred,"North Yorkshire, UK",Nov 2014,"To many dogs running around doing their business. Even witnessed a guy taking a dump on the beach!!! Broken glasses, broken bottles a plenty. Maybe somebody should invest some of the money taken on entry and get those beaches cleaned up."
adelaidegrega,"Richmond, Australia",Oct 2014,Had a great walk along the beach at sunset it was very romantic with my wife felt like we were 18 all over again.    ps (58)
milk77,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,"Used to stay at kuta area for 3-4times. It was my ist time staying near Seminyak area, beach was dirty and not many people. Guess i still prefer to stay at kuta area more fun."
barrywhitford,brighton england,Nov 2014,"go for sunset its amazing,The tide is quite strong at times and alot of surfers there,Many beach stalls for a cold beer"
Nick B,"Baltimore, MD",Oct 2014,Great to walk the beach day or night.....  Sand as far as you could walk...afternoon would get calm and you could swim comfortably.
Jade-cha,"Berlin, Germany",Nov 2014,"I have very fond memories of the place at night when my bf proposed to me there. Bali is beautiful, the people are nice and the beach adds a wonderful combination to it all."
Grant P,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2014,So much nicer than being hassled in Kuta on the beach front. Cleaner and better managed. Highly recommend
varun_ajmer,"Ajmer, India",Oct 2014,"great relaxing experience , not too touristy  but neither secluded.strong waves ( be ware of red flags)we enjoyed takings evening strolls there"
miu100,UK,Oct 2014,Beaches aren't very clean in Bali. This was the best I saw in a month of travel. Nice bars and beach clubs. 
mxdad026,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,Laid back communal beach that comes alive just before sunset when the warungs set up for the sunset.Casual seating with groovy background music.
Daonnydarwin,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2014,"We love to walk on the beach and we did everyday but the open drains spoil the walk, the smell is just a total turn off and we did not swim at all."
Foodie8668,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,Like the beach at Seminyak.  It is much lesser tourists and not as crowded as beach in Kuta for example!It is also clean and have a good stretch of nice beach with beautiful sand!  Love it!
Travel4yoga,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Apr 2014,The beach is crowded and a little dirty here. Don't leave items unattended. The hotels along the beach take care os their own beachfront - pay a little more to stay in one of these.
fionaclarew,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,The beach is NOT the highlight of Semiyak unless you enjoy raw sewage. There are a few activities and places to sunbathe but it is not an especially nice area-there are plenty of better beaches in Bali to visit. 
Fabster74,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2014,"Liked the sunsets, length of the beach. Disliked looking at the brown water and waste washing up! Also disliked the tenacious vendors trying to sell sarongs and sunglasses, but given how much the locals have to live on, it is understandable. "
torbstra,"Altona, Hamburg, Germany",Oct 2014,A really wonderful beach with white sand and very clean. A lot of beachbars around with good food and cold drinks. A paradise for surfer because great waves...i love it
Bruce,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2014,The hawkers get at you but that's ok. It's just not the nicest beach in Bali. Certainly not safe for younger children.
Jackie D,"Whakatane, New Zealand",Oct 2014,Walked along this beach and it was beautiful! Watch for areas that are used I believe for spiritual purposes and where swimming is not allowed! 
Kirk66,"Pakenham, Australia",Oct 2014,Great beach for a early morning walk or watching the sunset with a cocktail. A lot cleaner than I thought it would be. Great for surfing as well
Normac44,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,Long white sandy beach  and hot. standing on the beach you can see right back to the airport.Not so many beach vendors trying to sell stuff to you all the time.
Barbie B,"South Australia, Australia",Oct 2014,Loved this beach for the safe spot to swim and the amazing sunsets! Also convenient to walk to from our hotel in Seminyak!
cherylross2014,"Sydney, Australia",May 2014,"Ate at beachfront restaurants - superb seafood,  excellent Italian, and local specialties were far & away the most surprising thing about Bali"
Debra W,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,Loved walking along the beach in the mornings and viewing the sunset over the beach.Golf carts go between Double Six and The Breezes resort so good to use during the hot hours of the day.
davyb57,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Just returned from Seminyak and visited the beach on a few occasions. We found it very nice and great for a relaxing drink at sunset.Previous posters have commented that it was dirty. Yes the sand is sort of black but maybe that is it's natural hue. Dirty?......I'm not sure of that.In saying that, we were only there from sunset for a few hours, and found it lively and very relaxing."
John L,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Unclean, noisy, not what we would normally choose.  The surrounding establishments were very crowded and noisy."
DownunderLynn,26 contributions,Oct 2014,"Going to Bali was expecting a bit of paradise, didn't like the beach in Seminyak but had our own villa so bonus"
judithkendall1,kent,Oct 2014,We like to walk along the beach & paddle and this more than satisfied us.....places to stop for a drink...large waves so not for swimming but a few people surfing!
pandt2013,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach is dirty. Near black sand and brown water. We didn't go in the water for fear of getting sick. Beach is polluted with rubbish.  Not the White sand and clear water that we enjoy.  Make sure your accommodation has a good pool instead.  Or do a day trip to nusa dua or even better Dreamland.
BelMac,"Mount Macedon, Australia",Oct 2014,The beaches along the coast of Seminyak are between Legian and Canggu. They are wide with great surf and mostly whitish sand. Not much in comparison with Australian beaches but great for a walk. Be careful with swimming outside a patrolled area as the rips can be deadly. There are many beach merchants so be prepared. Also there are some Warungs further up the beach that provide cheap Balinese meals in a great atmosphere.  
Anabell,"Kastrup, Denmark",Oct 2014,I entered near the W hotel. I must admit I didn't go very far. To me it was not a beach where you lay down and sunbathe so was quickly of again
KMarth90,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"Great beach with lots of things to do and restaurants to eat at. It's also a bit quieter than Kuta. There are people constantly trying to sell you things, which can get annoying, but that's to be expected on a public beach. At night the beach side restaurants set up tables and bean bag chairs and there's also live music, it was great! "
abbottpotter,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Oct 2014,"Compared to the crowded Kuta beach, this beach is much better. The beach is quite peaceful, a nice place to stroll around or walk your dog. Might be a little crowded on the weekend since this is everyone's favorite place for jogging."
itefoster,"Rotherham, UK",Oct 2014,A lovely clean sandy beach that stretches for miles. If you love surfing then this is the beach fro you.
timfennis,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2014,"obviously a nice beach with plenty of places to chill, eat drink etc. Only thing that annoyed was the horrible 'pop/house' music that was played by every other beach venue. especially when having a hangover."
Brian108_11,"Belfast, UK",Oct 2014,Most of the best hotels and Restaurants back on to the beach which is really fantastic. They are clean with plenty of access points. You can access the beech from most of the hotels as the security officers don't mind
Hugo F,15 contributions,Sep 2014,"However the atmosphere is nice, nice hotels and restaurants, most private.  on Sundays afernoons is full os local people in a festive mood.  From time to time, if you are lucky you will see somehindu rituals by the beach."
Skye84,"Gosford, Australia",Oct 2014,"Love Seminyak beach for its sunsets, long walks, bean bag restaurants and merchants selling their wares. "
SweetKat,"Sitges, Spain",Oct 2014,"Good beach for surfing, not so much to swim. It is good if you're in a club as well KuD√©Ta enjoying the view and enjoying the sound of the sea. Good beach for walking."
HolidayHot,Melbourne Australia,Oct 2014,"Never ever have we seen so many empty toothpaste tubes (???!!!) on the beach... Surf was beautiful but makes the swimming difficult, best swimming in pools. One of the destinations were there is no boulevard along the beaches, from where to admire the sea view."
Cris H,2 contributions,Oct 2014,"I only gave three stars to the sea swimming in Seminyak beach as the waves are very powerful and the currents are extremely strong. They have flags to mark the ""safe"" swimming areas although there's no life guard in sight, and given the ferocity of the sea currents, you get easily dragged out to the unsafe areas. I'd suggest, no swimming at all or keep at the shallow area- and if you still want to go deeper anyway, be VERY careful, unless you are at very good swimmer. "
Hildyblues,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2014,"I was here mostly at the end of the day just before sunset and the first day the Red Flag was up for the rough seas.  The next day the sea was calmer but still if with children it is not really a calm sea for them to paddle in.  The ambience is really great at the sun sets, with all the restaurants setting out pouffs and sofas on the sand and as the sun sets, lanterns are lit and some restaurants haves plastic tables that illuminated and change colours, quite quirky but all setting a nice atmosphere.  Musicians perform at different restaurants and their songs mingle with the sound of the surf and carries along the beach.  Vendors of patios, bracelets, kites, shish as walk the beach but do not annoy you, when you refuse to buy.  The lights of the line of the coast can be seen and makes for a memorising evening."
skyhoosier,"Naples, FL",Sep 2014,"A beautiful wide beach down to the sea.  It's great for walking, catching some sun, or splashing through the water.  Not too many hawkers and they are generally well behaved. The water can be rough with some undertow, so one has to be careful, and pay attention to beach advisories."
MaseandLinke M,20 contributions,Oct 2014,"This beach is so much better than Kuta. Less beach hawkers and better bars/restaurants. Watching sunset, drink in hand, sitting in a bean bag whilst listening to music is just heaven."
England B,Singapore,Oct 2014,"Visited the beach around midday after deciding to walk down to Kuta. As we walked to the beach there were a number of open sewers running along the side of the back streets and when we got onto the beach one of them was running down the beach to the sea giving off an unbearable smell. We preserve only to find another runoff just 50m up the beach, again given a terrible smell. After that we gave up and decided it wasn't worth it. When you have such amazing beaches over at Sanur, why both with this one at all??That said, the place looked like it had great surf and apparently the sunset is good so on that basis I have to assume its worth a couple of stars, otherwise I'd have given it zero as the competition is much better"
pandainsingers,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,One of the longest and cleanest beaches we have seen. Big surf. Unspoilt. Not busy. Great fun. Saw a number of people jogging which made us feel very lazy!
Sophia S,2 contributions,Sep 2014,"Nice beach for walk, sunbathing and sunset with a glass of cocktail. It's not like Kuta beach, this beach is quite."
diamonds48,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,This is one of the best beaches to walk along enjoing the sea and to experience the beautiful sunset go and enjoy
Christopher S,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"The beach was a quick walk from our villa, we arrived around 4.30 and grabbed a seat to watch the sunset and have an early dinner. Plenty of places to eat and so so cheap. You will get bugged by people selling kites and watches."
Macy_love,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,"very busy at times but amazing sunsets, beautiful for a morning run, such a fun atmosphere and really good for swimming :)"
Patricia L,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach was less crowded than near Legian and Kuta. We slowly walked at the water's edge for under an hour to get to some restaurants in Legian. There were some good restaurants in Seminyak but we have our favourite in Legian.
Yasmina_a678,"Baku, Azerbaijan",Oct 2014,"Very nice but for surfer , very crowded but easy to find place Clean Dislike a lot of seller and nagging "
Devashish P,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,Average Beach close to seminyak square a good shopping area with good Restaurants and Bars.Try Kuta beach for more Fun.
FledgeColac,"Glen Iris, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach is great to walk along but in most places the undertow is too strong for safe swimming. Although they clean the beach every morning there still seems to be a fair amount of rubbish.
Cruiserchick2248,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Oct 2014,"Not the best beach I have been but it is a patrolled beach with lifesavers, lots of bars and restaurants, the usual touts selling their wares, massages etc. go just before sunset for spectacular sunset photos."
ClaireF2239,"Chesterfield, UK",Sep 2014,"There are several smelly sewerage inlets into the sea which you have to paddle through as you walk down the beach. Beach sellers are persistent.Plenty of paid sun beds to use, clean sand, plenty of snack bars. Lots of places not suitable for swimming due to red flags."
Olly,"London, UK",Sep 2014,"While the sunsets are beautiful and the range of beach front bars and restaurants are great, the grey sand and violent waves (meaning swimming was prohibited while I was there) mean this is a fairly average beach for this part of the world. I have to add that I didn't see any of the litter many others had reported."
Russell4157,"Hervey Bay, Australia",Oct 2014,"Coming from Australia, the beach is ordinary at best.  The sand is coarse and the water a little turbid.  Have seen better in other countries."
Smeli_Meli,"Hobart, Australia",Sep 2014,"Many venues overlook seminyak beach allowing you a view to sunset from a location ideal to your tastes, be they food, wine, resort or night club."
LuisTacon,"Portonovo, Spain",Sep 2014,Very nice beach for tourists. You have many activities to do on the beach.Also the umbrellas and bed are cheap for the day.
knucklehead,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2014,This beautiful beach is less busy than Kuta or Legian beach. Great place for sunset. Surf and swim can be dangerous sometimes. Scary waves when I went there. Bargain for benches and massages!
DPrakoso,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2014,Way better and cleaner than Kuta. You will see the most attractive Indonesian girl here. You can lie down the air-sofa and enjoy your beer or coconut water. This is called a life.
Chris R,"London, UK",Sep 2014,"Not the most beautiful beach in the region, but a fantastic sea for surfers and larking about. A fair number of touts too."
ChrisPrice12345,"Karuizawa-machi, Japan",Mar 2014,"Don't get stressed by people selling things, they are just trying to make a living, massages are good.  Enjoy the buzz and people watching. Negotiate hard, but in the end, dont worry about it. Have fun. La Plancha is esp[ecially good in the evenings.  Obey the lifeguards / signs - the surf can be dangerous. Our neighbour died (drowned) off The Legion hotel beach"
KBattaloo,"Clarens, South Africa",Sep 2014,If you go to Seminyak you just have to experience a sunset on the beach and sit on the bean bags that go all along the beach. I had the best cocktails on the beach here. And could have sat there for hours!
carly g,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,This beach is beautiful if you want go on a quiet peaceful stroll. Go to kudeta and enjoy a cocktail watching the beautiful sunset. Absolutely amazing sunset.
Joanne F,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2014,Water was quite turbulent when we visited so I'm sure it looks prettier at other times. Hawkers parade in front of the beach bars selling their goods. Several good looking bars/restaurants offering good views.
rob b,"London, UK",Sep 2014,The beach was so lovely surfers paradise never felt pressed to buy the local goods but they are very lovely peopleWe saw many weddings and the security is very good
sozo12,"Los Angeles, CA",Sep 2014,"real beach scenenoisy, crowdedperfect for young at hearthard to walk abouttransportation system needs thinkingbit too chaotic"
Marmifero,"Lisbon, Portugal",Sep 2014,"Very nice smooth shelf great for walking and dwelling, but pollution everywhere from urban wastewater drainages across it extension. If you‚Äôre too much in the water you‚Äôll get an ear infection or worse, which is a shame. It‚Äôs with a bitter taste that we realize how superb environments in Bali like Seminyak, especially in Southern areas, have been destroyed by pollution. Something definitely needs to be done to recover these areas."
Ian B,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"Potato Head is one ...Ku De Ta is another place that is a must, especially at sunset, to eat, drink and take in a beautiful Bali sunset..."
Debbie4591,29 contributions,Jun 2014,"I love this beach! So clean and the sand is soft so I didn't have to worry about stepping on stones or broken shells. If you want to have a swim go there by 3 pm that way you get some sun cause once it is dark you won't be able to swim. The current is strong so be careful. After swimming you can go to any of the shacks on the beach. There's a whole strip of places to choose from. Seafood is really good. Each place has its own band and vibes so just walk around and see which you like best before selecting. We enjoyed 'Chiringuito'.There are a lot of hawkers that will sell you sarongs, bracelets etc. They are a bit annoying cause they come to you as soon as you sit at one of the shacks. Although they do have lovely stuff but you can get the same at a way cheaper rate in Padang Padang beach.Its more of a younger crowd at the beach and a few kids. Great place to chill and end your night."
Stephen O,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,"You cant go past this as a fantastic part of the beach to relax and enjoy the sun, the sunset or an evening meal.   Restaurants that sprawl out onto the sand with bean bags to match make an evening drink and a bite to eat a memorable experience.   This is what tropical holidays are supposed to be like ..."
mjck1945,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Sep 2014,The chairs are involved for relaxingThe chairs for comfort and looking at the hot chicks despite my ageGood reasonable surf  but beware if women selling
Laura A,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2014,"Seminyak beach is a really long stretch of dark sand, so don't expect the postcard white sands.... It is a lovely place to visit, however, even without the white sands. Head to the part further south in the direction of legian (but try to avoid legian itself if you can) near to the royal beach resort.. Then hire a beach bed for around 15000 and relax- the day we went there were plenty of interesting people heading back and forth along the front but it wasn't busy, just right... In the evening there are pleasant enough bars set on the front if you fancy that too."
Sindy B,"Albuquerque, NM",Sep 2014,There are so many places to eat and sit and watch the sun set. No charge to use them just order food/drinks and they are cool. Colorful bean bags and umbrella chaise line the beach. Surf schools available right on site. 
fnqfamily,Australia,Sep 2014,"Make sure you hit the beach before sunset, they are amazing. We enjoyed watching the waves crashing and the odd surfer too. Beach front bars were very popular at that time of day."
Mark A,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,Not a great swimming beach. Seminak sewage flows down hill to the beach. I didn't see anyone in the water (except someone with Bali Belly). Also the main beach is a religious area that forbits swimming.
Kylie T,"Doncaster, Australia",Sep 2014,"Great waves, felt save. Lots of families. Food in Seminyak is generally terrific. We ate a lot! Missed the massages due to lack of time but will return to do it again for sure"
CarolinaBetancur,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2013,Seminyak beach is one of the most popular beaches in Bali. I loved the sunset there!! The nice atmosphere and the local food is good.
Anji J,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2014,"There are alot of little bars run by locals along the beach but look out for ""Molly's Bar' (almost directly infront of the Hard Rock Cafe), Molly is a dog the bar is named after - great owners! Very Friendly"
Lucas D,"England, UK",Jul 2014,"I like the beach since not to many person come to theis beach area, you still may jow the view, have fun with friends, playing the sand and look the beautiful wave at the ocean."
Mary_AnnC_11,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jun 2014,Relaxed fresh food with the company of locals who aim to please time to relax and spend a dollar or two with the beach traders
Sally H,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Sep 2014,the hawkers were polite and not too in your face.  The kids got their henna tattoos and hair braided and the people that did it were lovely.  loved watching the sunset on the beach
dicknick22,"Cathedral City, CA",Sep 2014,"great beach but bargin for chairs w umbrella.. I paid 80,000 they started at 200,000. gado gado restaurant is at the beach ..great but expensive."
DebbieGeelong,"Geelong, Australia",Jun 2014,Great place for the wedding photos whilst the sun was setting. We all gathered here to watch all the activities happening on the beach  and to revel in the tranquility of the waves rolling in. At that time it wasn't too crowded. 
Robost,"Prague, Czech Republic",Jul 2014,"the best here is to walk, relax, enjoy. and you may find a lot of interesting places from the beach: temples, beach clubs like Potato Head or KuDeTa, restaurants. the stilish side of Bali"
Brian W,"Loxton, Australia",Oct 2013,just the peaceful atmosphere and friendly locals and how close to the hotel was just a few steps away 
Maggie H,Sydney,Sep 2014,"For Aussies, Bali beaches are pretty mediocre. Costs a small fortune to sit on a recliner and constantly harrassed by the poor sarong ladies."
Easygoingtrev,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,Was great to have locals looking after tourists bringing out drinks making sure your enjoying yourselves.
Susan R,6 contributions,Sep 2014,Lots of smelly sections to Seminyak beach so choose which place you sit carefully so you are sunbaking under the waft of sewerage
Morganleee,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Oct 2013,"the beaches in siminyak were amazing!, i absolutly loved them!,the only down side of the beaches is the beggers and the people trying to sell you items when you trying to relax and eat your meal!, but other then that, its was a beauty to our trip."
Bogwog68,"Arthurs Seat, Australia",Sep 2014,"Head down an hour or so before sunset and enjoy the show. Head down to the right find a bean bag, order a drink and some snacks and the rest is easy. "
smartcookie50,"surrey, england",Sep 2014,Ocean was great for surfing market hawkers abound but you to need to barter to get a bargain. Grab a bed and relax
William C,5 contributions,Sep 2014,"Good waves, beach kind to your feet not loike in Europe, water temp good.  Not too cold.  Water not as clear as I like but waves consistent and good.Plenty of eating houses and you can buy just about anything on the beach.Great spot to visit...."
MargetBrisbane,Brisbane,Sep 2014,Quite a few hawkers which was off putting. Darker sand not so nice and the beach was pretty crowded.
Traceeey,"Wellington, New Zealand",Sep 2014,too many people trying to sell you things and too many stray dogs. Its a beautiful beach but these things put us off
Scott Berry,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,Nice place to relax on a deck chair and have on of the beach boys look after all your needs and get you beers as well.
Kevin M,3 contributions,Sep 2014,"Couldn't figure out why so many foreigners (mostly Aussies) flocked to a beach so dirty and stinky.  Yes, there was surfing waves, but it wasn't of any quality."
erbr63,"Rapperswil, Switzerland",Sep 2014,"We were walking up and down the beach several times with great joy during our 2 week vacation. With high tide and low tide.  Great spot for sunsets, but not ideal for swimming, strong current. great for surfing, has plenty of bars and coffee shops for resting along the beach and lovely in the evening too.  Prices for beach chair ridiculous...  Beach was reasonably clean."
wobbly2014,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,No tide and flat for walking also good surfing. If your fit you can walk from double six to potatoe head and kuta along beach
Henrique G,"Lisbon, Portugal",Oct 2013,"Gente people, Nice restaurants,good shopping. Confortable villas and spas. Easy and unexpensive transportation"

Kate S,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2014,Always packed with people and sand is black and dirty. No direction as to which part of the beach belongs to the hotel as the private beach is not easy to identify 
Kirsty W,"Canberra, Australia",Sep 2014,"The beach was pretty, had black sand mixed in with the white, was pretty clean. I only saw two pieces of rubbish among the half a km I walked. You can't sun bake in certain areas because they are sacred so look for the signs. There are many hotels you can go sit and enjoy the view along the walk or street venders have set up lounges for you to lie on for a price. You do get hassled by the locals a fair bit to buy their wares but they aren't too pushy. The water however was rough as guts, as an experienced swimmer I had difficulty going out further than my waist the waves were strong and they were churning up a lot of sand. The beach is patrolled by lifeguards."
Mandzolive,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Seminyak's beach has black sand, its quite rough so not good for people who aren't confident swimmers.Kuta beach is better for swimming and spending the day."
Katie F,"New York City, NY",Sep 2014,"The sand and beach aren't the best in Bali, but the sunsets are best and it's easy to learn to surf. Recommend paying for the chair/umbrella for the day and/or hanging out at one of the many beach bars to watch the sunset. Also, many options for surfing rentals and lessons. "
susiebeer,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"The music the restaurants  the water, the bean bags  the sun going down.Food quite good few people selling stuff  nice watching the surfers and big waves."
Sez0816,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Aug 2014,"Well, I love beaches so it's hard to disappoint.  Very nice beach - you can rent a lounge chair for pretty cheap and truly enjoy the crashing waves.  Various restaurants scattered along the shore to enjoy a drink or food as well."
Mark S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,great water but watch the waves as they can be very roughnice to walk along in morning and eveningwater is clean and warm
Joe L,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Seminyak beach, is not very good for swimming due to the large waves rolling in, however great for surfing, and the sand is course and brown."

ASparrow,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"We did a little of wave chasing and kite flying during the sunset and that was just awesome!I was in awe of the gorgeous sunset, the black sand and the gigantic waves.During our stay in Seminyak Beach Resort, there was a rare occasion of releasing the baby turtles. That was one of our trip highlights and once in a lifetime experience."
maguscanook,"Toronto, Canada",Sep 2014,"Walking hand in hand with a loved one on this clean, wide beach are treasured moments for sure. We stayed at the Seminyak so it was easy to stroll down after breakfast and work off some of those calories! Sunsets are the reason to rave over this view/location though. Spectacular!!"
Herza,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,20 min walk to seminyak beach from Seminyak Square.Better than Kuta Beach but lack of restaurant/cafe
wayne d,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,"i understand the need for money but every 5-10 minutes people touching you trying to give massage or sell something you can never relax you have to say no several times,no good for relaxing or privacy"
Mala4050,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,first of all I don't like dark sand as it looks dirty but here it didn't help that it smelled badly as well 
JMF62,"Albury, Australia",Sep 2014,"The bars are relaxed and sitting on a bean bag or day bed having a cocktail a the Bali sunsets is amazing. Cool music and DJ's v casual and friendly, Be nice and firm with the sellers and they'll show you respect and leave you in peace or engage with them and shop as you sit and relax, either way great fun."
Xquisiterequisite,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2014,Beautiful beach with huge waves. We loved walking along this beach everyday during our trip.When the tide gets low the sand has a reflective glow and it is quite an amazing sight to behold. The sunsets were beautiful too. Most importantly there aren't any annoyingly persistent touts and vendors like what I've experienced in Kuta before. 
Rudi H,19 contributions,Oct 2013,"We are a family who loving to visit Bali. We have visited Bali for three times. The reason why my family love Bali because Bali has many interesting beaches such as Kuta, Legian, Dream land, Sanur and Seminyak. Beaches at south Bali have location are not far from the airport. Seminyak beach has amazing view especially when sunset moment."
everwindingroad,"Oakland, CA",Jun 2014,"I loved the mix of soft beige sand, with the soft black ash‚Ä¶ it created what I am calling tiger sand.  The beach is lined up with lounge chairs that you rent from the locals.  We found a spot in front of a cafe with awesome coffee, liquor selections, and smoothies so we were set for a whole day of relaxing at the beach.  Even better, this cafe had Wi-Fi, so we could be sending photos to friends and making everyone jealous.  We tried to get in some surf classes, but the swells were pretty high and we were beginners, so we sat on the loungers all day.  Vendors are non-stop bombarding you with wares that they sell to tourists for a high price. Knowing this, I still ended up buying something for more than normal because he made me feel like I would bring him some luck for the day.  We did walk the beach at a certain point after getting board of sitting out.  Beware of the streams of water flowing out to the ocean, I don' know what it is, but I don't trust it.  Also, be aware some beach area is on temple grounds so no one can lay out on it- its pretty obvious where those areas are."
siamsabu2014,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,Liked this beach but prefer double six..beware of people selling their wares as they tend to be very pushy but just let them politely know you're not interested and they'll usually leave you be..
Peter R,"Bangkok, Thailand",Sep 2014,Surf can be a bit dangerous & sand is a bit dirty however there are a lot of places that have deck chairs bean bags etc  & food & beverages can be ordered wilst lapping up the sun
Dan_S,"London, UK",Mar 2014,"Very strong waves meaning unable to swim freely. The beach itself was quite vast but fairly littered with debris (although in fairness, the locals made constant efforts to remove the washed up rubbish). A quiet beach though with sufficient peace to relax."
Joy S,"Lincoln, UK",Aug 2014,"Coming from England but living in Australia, this beach fits somewhere in the middle.The sand is not white but more grey, and there didn't seem to be much ""dry sand"".There was plenty of sunbed (for a fee) and lots and lots of balinese people trying to sell you things. They can be pushy and annoying, but all you have to do is say no. We noticed one guy making fresh cocktails for people so maybe you wouldn't want to turn this one down!The most beautiful thing about this beach were the waves, i've never seen anything like it before. Waves starting from so far back, it was so mesmerizing to watch."
Helena R,London,Aug 2014,Not good for sunbathing in tranquility but big open beach and great for beach combing and fantastic for sunset
Excursionista14,Philippines,Aug 2014,"Seminyak Beach is a wide stretch of beach, and is not as crowded as, say, Kuta Beach.There's also plenty of restaurants by the beach - perfect for sunset viewing."
ggabi,Romania,Aug 2014,"There is nothing wrong to this beach, but my expectations were much higher. I found a regular beach with nothing that really impressed me."
Edward I,"Edinburgh, UK",Aug 2014,Very clean and not as busy as nearby Kuta.  There is a strong current and big waves which are ideal for surfers but maybe keep your eye on kids or those who are not strong swimmers
Gartigot,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2014,"I have to say that surfing there is awesome, as the breaks are big and you have a great time. Also the bars and cafes around are allright. on the other hand, the beach sometimes smells bad and there is some garbage around, homeless dogs also wonder around. If you are looking for good surf that's the place, but don't expect crystaline water and sand."
Diana J,Sydney,Aug 2014,"Like most beaches in Bali, it's dirty. Sand is black and full of rubbish and the water is the same. Didn't swim, only went in the water at our villa"
Johnypappa,2 contributions,Aug 2014,"bustling beach with loads of shacks and restaurants to choose from, sit and relax. Great food and loved Bintang beer.Mostly clean beach considering the foot fall. "
Somyakh,"London, UK",Oct 2013,"Good to spend some time. We saw lot of activities going around, lot of families playing together. It was good to see so much happening, with the cool wind at the sunset. Though we found some places with litter. But this beach is busy with many shops, many hotels and restaurant by its sides. In short, I would love to go again. The feel of the place is amazing."
Cubix F,"Bridgend, UK",Aug 2014,Long long long beach. Great sand. We found it very clean. The waves are big so pay attention to the flags and guards. There are sellers on the beach but there are all over the world and they are no problem.
Lisa O,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2014,"Endless white sand,great surf.hawkers and sellers are very annoying.dogs allowed on beach and poo in the sand.my husband put his elbow in some,yuk.rips very strong so be very careful.not suitable for kids un acompanied."
kawuwung,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2013,Waves up on the beach. Nice to play water with family. Surrounding many stores which selling clothes - beach clothing and souvenirs of Bali. Many expensive or cheap hotel near the beach.
PLC,"Purley, UK",Aug 2014,"If entering by the temple, then choose the path by the square, not the alleyway, as there is waste water being drained from the hotel(?) straight onto the beach and into the sea water and you will have to walk through it to get to the quieter part of the beach.  If entering by the square, take a left when you reach the beach as you will not experience the pungent smells from the waste water being blown in the wrong direction.If hiring a lounge, don't pay more than 20000rph per person for a few hours.Stay until sunset - worth waiting for!"
KezOz,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Such a wonderful area to spend a couple of hours enjoying the sunset and a few drinks, sitting on bean bags under beach umbrellas.  Loved the experience"
Suzie H,10 contributions,Aug 2014,"The beach was very nice,just to get away from The hotel pool. Lots of people wanting to sell u goods,if u dont want to buy just tell them ur not interested. Lots of bargains if u like haggling "
Steve V,"London, United Kingdom",Aug 2014,"A massive stretch of sand with a gentle gradient into the sea, lots of people surfing but not great for a swim.  The hawkers on the beach become very wearing after a while as can't read a book or relax without someone trying to sell you something for more than about 10 minutes.  Great place for a sunset but as are the number of bars and restaurants which overlook the beach and you can get a drink in these and not be hassled.  A bit of little but seen much worse!"
SurbhiGoyal,10 contributions,Jul 2014,"This is a good beach for surf boarding and boogie boarding. Waves are high and give good momentum for a nice surf boarding experience. You will find many expert surfers riding on the waves. You will need to rent boards and seats. We had paid 100,000 rupiah for 2 hours for 2 boogie boards and 2 seats (got this rate after a bit of negotiation). Also, if you come by bike, make sure to park your bike near to the area where beach is flatter and people are surfing. We had parked our bike closer to the area where resorts are located and beaches are steeper. And it was a long walk back (especially tiresome after the surf boarding session). Don't forget to carry a sunscreen!"
Dheatherh,"Lakewood, New Jersey",Feb 2014,Cannot visit Seminyak without going down to the beach to watch the fantastic sunset andEnjoy food from one of the many venders.  A most enjoyable experience.
andreaSlovenia,slovenia,Jun 2014,"Our first beach in Bali, we loved its relaxed atmosphere, especially late afternoon. We enjoyed having a drink in beach warungs, laying in beanbags, watching people, sunset, the waves... our little daughter was running around, playing with other kids, enjoying the sand. It was perfect for the three of us. During the day was good ok, but a little difficult for small kids being in big waves."
Procidani,Melbourne,Aug 2014,"Come to Seminyak beach for a sunset.  Get here before 5pm and choose one of the many beach bars to plonk yourself down on one of the colorful beanbags, order some tapas and a Bintang and listen to trendy music while the sun goes down.  Bali sunsets never fail to disappoint."
Gerard Payne,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Loved the beach warungs cold beer at sunset , disliked the drunk Aussies drinking longnecks . 5,000 , maybe 10,000 people stretching from nth seminyak to kuta , watching the sun drop over the ocean with warm breezes , beats winter in Sydney ."
PortLincolnYHA,"Port Lincoln, Australia",Aug 2014,We walked along the beach to Legian everyday was great! We did not swim in the sea as it was a bit rough.
Will B,"San Rafael, CA",May 2014,"Went specifically for the sunset - and it was spectacular!  While the beach and bars were pretty packed, it still felt like fun!"
Milleben,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jul 2014,"it's a wild beautiful beach, we went there every night just to se the beautiful sunset. it's also a good place to surf :) (and to learn have to surf)"
IreneHorne,"Kangaroo Island, Australia",Aug 2014,Great place to unwind in the many resorts along the beachUnfortunately cant swim there as beach is rather dirty
Zachary Parore,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2014,"I was disappointed by the beach at Seminyak.  Strong rip tide, Trash and an Algae bloom at the shoreline didn't make for good swimming or an enjoyable time at the beach.  Coarse grey sand isn't really my thing either. I do recommend visiting any number of the beach clubs along the beach such as Ku De Ta and Potato Head. There are a lot of nice resorts on the waterfront, but I cannot recommend that you spent too much time on the beach itself.The area of Seminyak was a great place to stay, and I would stay there again.  Having been to so many other beaches in South East Asia, I was disappointed - my expectations were unrealistic.If you like white Sandy beaches, try out Nusa Dua, or even the pristine ones out by Jimbaran or Ungasan."
glenn t,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,just a beach with surf breaks. the sand is a dirty brown color not white or golden.. also come when the currents are running the wrong way and you may as well try swimming at the local tip
Graciousme29,21 contributions,Aug 2014,I will not return to this beach. If it weren't for the accommodation I would have left earlier.The beach is covered in litter. The noise from the big bars is annoying and I could not enjoy my walk because I just saw one after the other white fat burnt tourist bargaining over $1.00 for sarongs and other cheap & nasty tourist crap. Then there is the ever present G4S security circling the bars making me feel unsafe. Never again.
chelsren18,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2014,"Average type beach, Personally i would perfer Kuat beach although Seminyak is alot quieter it is alot dirtier with rubbish and broken glass frequently seen along the beach/waters edge. So manhy rips formed it was unsafe to swim the whole time we were there (1 week) Make the effort and vsiit nusa dua beach if your looking for the 5 star beaches in bali or always try Kuta beach and find a qutei becach bar top enjoy a few cold bevys."
Coenen H,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"Very excellent beach with white sands, clean and only 30 minutes from Kuta. Location always be traffic jam on midday.All expensive in Seminyak. We rent 4 beach seats for 400K IDR with hard bargain to local man but he's very take care of us. Many small restaurants and bars surrounding beach, also hotels, shopping centres and spa services.Really made us relax for sleeping and swimming on Seminyak beach."
Edmond C,"Bellagio, Italy",Aug 2014,"We love the soft sand and long beach. Walking along it feels great. If you get a spot in front of happening clubs, you can enjoy great music with sea breeze"
Tracy C,"London, UK",Aug 2014,"Just had two weeks here. Great for couples, it's quiet and has a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach. Strong waves on seminyak beach so great for body boarding and surfing. Or watching those who do. Really pays to get a beach view room and certainly the room we had was very beautiful. The staff above all make this place, they could not be warmer, friendlier or more professional. The location close to the 'Oberoi strip' made this perfect for us. Just a quick walk and you are in the melee of every possible restaurant, bar and shops. Very busy but a nice contrast to the calmness of the hotel. Try to avoid rooms close to Ku De Ta next door as they do have very loud DJ parties. Our only surprise was a lack of a bar to go to in the evening. Sometimes we wanted to come back to the hotel in the evening and have a drink. Really surprised they don't have one. They do put on nice dinner evenings but they seemed to be not overly patronised. Their food is very good though,excellent chefs, even for the poolside snacks. However, for a quiet, romantic couples hotel (this was our honeymoon), we absolutely loved our stay and would definitely recommend "
Jenny M,2 contributions,Aug 2014,"great beach, lots of seating and good bars close by...................................................."
Steve G,"Camberley, UK",Aug 2014,Much quieter and more relaxing than Legian's beach and a million times better than Kuta's. Sanur is still the best unless you can afford the scary prices of Nusa Dua hotels.
sightseeoz,australia,Aug 2014,I live in a part of the world with the best beaches and found the dark gritty sand plus the fact I was unable to avoid walking through drain muck I found vey  unappealling in Seminyak. Getting to the beach was  difficult as they have used every bit of the prime real estate to build on. Suggest going to Potatoe Head with infinity pool overlooking ocean. If you don't mind the music.
Owen R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Clean beach and great for a morning swim before most of the tourists are awake.  Plenty of bars to check-out for sunset drinks too.  Short walk north to Potato Head Beach Club, Ku De Ta, and beachfront hotels."
J S,23 contributions,Aug 2014,"Of course this place is not a secluded beach in the middle of nowhere but one of the busiest beaches in Bali. However, it is still clean and good for swimming, surfing, tanning and watching the sun set."
Lauren S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2014,Grab a lounger for a fee or put your towel on the sand for free.  Beach is nice and wide and not crowded compared to European beaches (although those of us from NZ or Aus might find it a bit busier than we prefer!).  Beware of strong undercurrents and keep within your depth - there are lifeguards but not everywhere.  Good beginner surfing waves
greentravelwriter,"Paris, France",Aug 2014,"Come here for the experience of watching the sunset on colorful bean bags with hundreds of other people, and for some decent swimming when conditions are not too rough. However the beach can be pretty annoying too with a lot of commercialization and pollution ... "
Paul Douglass,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,I was disappointed with the quality of the beach after hearing so much about it‚Ä¶if you can overlook the countless stray dogs and plastic bags and the ungodly odour then I guess you could say its okay. Personally the black volcanic sands don't sit well‚Ä¶nor does the effluent running into the swimming water‚Ä¶needless to say i didn't go for a swim at this beach this trip.
123eaze,"Berkeley, California",Aug 2014,"The beach in Seminyak tended to be crowded in spots, but it is a nice beach for walking and for dipping into the water.  One really can't swim there because of dangerous rip tides.  I was surprised that the supposedly white sand was the color of dirt and not the white sand I have found at other beaches.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed being on the beach. "
fanny t,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"beautiful sunset from here. litle bit dirty, sunbed is bit expensive. to many dogs and dogs owner never pick up the poo"
1979Ian,"Burntisland, UK",Sep 2013,"Shame you can't really swim in the sea but we spent so much time here, it was beautiful and with plenty of little bars to enjoy a drink and some food in."
Mariezee68,"Ocean Grove, Australia",Aug 2014,"Hire a bed and stay for the day. If you don't want to buy, be firm and say ' no thankyou' don't show any interest or be prepared they will all flock, so decide what you want to buy and stick to it! "
dinda_brygitta,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"if you have a plan to visiting Bali with a child. dont forget to cek evebabycare.com they rent baby equipment such us; stroller or pram, car seat, high chair, baby cot or portacot. they deliver to your hotel or villa. many brand to chosen. all equipment is good condition and clean."
Stephen C,"Victoria, Australia",Jul 2014,cleanliness the team on beach selling lounges and umbrellas very polite felt safe on the beach with lifeguards
Ibadanboy,"Nairobi, Kenya",Aug 2014,"Seminyak Beach is a very nice beach in Bali. Great to walk along - you can walk down to Kuta and for stunning sunsets since it is on the West side of the island. Housing many numerous hotels, restaurants and bars, Seminyak is somewhat more sophisticated than its sister Kuta. It has a decent stretch of whitish sand, and the water is okay. Currents could also be strong so be careful when you swim in here and respect all instructions from lifeguards and the hotel staff. Cool beach to hang out on and watch the surfers do  their thing."
Supacarl,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2014,"There is a sewerage outlet lagoon at the beach which smells really bad at this point, the rest is what you would expect from an ordinary beach anywhere else in the world."
Martin S,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Aug 2014,The beach stretch about 3 miles with soft dark sand. Its very crowded because we came in holiday season. There is many cafe along the beach.
MFPaulina,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"The wave in the morning is awesome, suitable for kids to learn to surf. The sunset view is good from the here. "
kate a,Spain,Jul 2014,Me and my wife after touring stop at Seminyak beach to see the sunset.a very memorable time with my friends enjoying the sunset view on the beach of Seminyak.
Anish G,"Doha, Qatar",Jul 2014,"As we came into the beach area, we could see red flags i.e. strong current signs at various intervals...it was 9am in morning and there was a good cool breeze and chilly water...Beach was fabulous and the strong waves encouraged me to try Surfing for the first time. I couldn't balance much in 2-3 hrs of time, but really enjoyed the strong waves and fabulous surfing type experience...My son, was engrossed all time with the waves and dark sand mountains...If you are not in surfing, just relax, enjoy the quiteness and view one of the strong wave beaches in Bali..the strong Indian ocean wavesHighly recommended if you are in Kuta areaJust take care when you rent a seat / place to sit...check that the person has water supply working...else you will feel a shock with salty water sticking your body and far away places to wash it down ..."
Annyta P,"Corrigin, Australia",Feb 2014,"It was really windy the day we went there, there had also been big event of some sort. I found the beach to be pretty dirty looking and  the water the same. I would not have swam in it."
kaiki83,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2014,"I liked how it had less people but the beach was still pretty much lie Kuta, the floor of the beach is quite high so even non-swimmers can enjoy the waves."
Jayantk_12,"Pune, India",Jul 2014,"can watch a beautiful sun-set. You can have a long walk and go to Petitengate temple. their you can have a peaceful time, see local people pray the god along with their family and friends."

Keisha2075,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2014,Had lots of fun on Seminyak beach .. good place to hang out .. beautiful sunset .. but sometimes rubbish can be a problem ...
FoodieSingapore,Singapore,Jul 2014,"Good surf beach,perfect for sunbathing but watch out for the current and the waves.  Lots of loungers with parasols available for a price, haggle to get a good hourly or daily rate - not much shade otherwise."
mmhsydney,sydney,Jul 2014,"Ate at the Seminyak Beach hotel for dinner, We were the only diners at the restaurant which we thought was interesting as service was slow. Food was fresh and nicely presented "
Paul L,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2014,"This is a surfing beach with big waves, but for those that don't surf it's a gray beach to play in the waves"
helenford,"Auckland, New Zealand",Dec 2013,We chose Seminyak as we read it was a more upmarket area than Kuta etcHowever we didn't think much of the beachA few mangy dogs and no one around muchIn fact Seminyak didn't impress We loved our Resort but the infrastructure was worse than Kuta - broken paths - open drains etcWe wouldn't choose Seminyak again
Steven W,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"The beach is an open expanse of water, running many kilometres in each direction.  Care must be taken as there are sand bars close to the beach causing rips and second waves which casual swimmers will find hard.The surf is close to the beach, forming and closing only 50 metres from the water edge, yet allows the wave to run all the way to the sand.  So allows beginner surfers some opportunity to catch smaller sets to get on board and enjoy."
Teresa S,"Hervey Bay, Australia",Jul 2014,Always busy but always nice sometimes too many hawkers they get tiresome but it's bali so what to expect 
rudy_setiawan,"Batam Center, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"much better beach compare to Kuta, Sanur and Nusa Dua.. it has a beautiful sunset and brownie sands.. it feel much relax here compare to other beach. Recommended to visit"
eztraveller73,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,This is by far the best beach we saw in Bali. The beach is clean and you can see people enjoying walks and the health conscious ones running along the long stretch of white sand. The shacks/restaurants all have beanbags with umbrellas setup for their patrons to enjoy the beautiful sunset while sipping on a Bintang or a fancy cocktail.  Plenty of live music choices and some had DJs playing a good mix of old skool music and todays tunes.
NosfromMaroubra,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,"I guess like other Australians, you just can't compare this beach to the beautiful beaches in Aus. Its fine for a jog or walk in the morning on the dark grey sand but I didn't want to swim here due to all the rubbish washed up each morning and the smelly lines of drains washing into the sea every so often.  I kept to Hotel pools."
Morris120,"Chaiyaphum, Thailand",Jul 2014,Relaxing water and laid back feeling. Not many shopping areas along the beach. Very good place to chill at night. Worth to visit in Bali if you're around.
gdbalidriver,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"This beach is located on the north beach of Kuta. From Kuta, Legian and Seminyak you can reach on foot. Its atmosphere is almost the same as Kuta, except for its location a bit far from the bustle of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak beach visitors not as much as the beach of Kuta. You can also do the activity that goes on Kuta beach. Swimming, sun bathing on white sand, surfing, playing football on the coast, also enjoy the panoramic view at sunset.Interestingly, in all the way to the coast line stand Seminyak restaurant that offers dishes that tastes so Yummy, from low price to expensive price and also there are a plenty of luxury beach club, of the traditional dishes to international cuisine. That why the street called eating street."
Mayberries,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,"Being from Australia it's hard to find better beaches elsewhere, but rubbish on the beach is just a big no! If you want to swim in a clean ocean or lie on a lovely sandy beach I wouldn't recommend Bali. "
szkut,"Kincumber, Australia",Jul 2014,"Found this to be the best beach around the Kuta area, although always busy. Our 1st day was perfect, great waves for body surfing. But then our next 3 visits it was way to rough and rips everywhere, I would have to say if in Australia the beach would have been closed.But all in all if you are staying in the area it is a good option. We personally liked the more southern beaches which did have white sand, here the sand is a grey colour."
mitch507,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"You could get four couches for 50,000 per hour for the four, if you shop aroundGood fun trying surfingBeer o'clock lots of nice places after three hours in surf and sun"
sasiki1,"Steamboat Springs, CO",Jun 2014,"like it was so close, but I wouldn't say its the greatest looking beach. But store and other things for shopping is a plus if you want to fall for overpriced trinkets. Beach also has restaurants along the beach where you can watch the sunset with a drink, meal, and music in the breeze. "
montygulati27,"New Delhi, India",May 2014,"I beg to differ here from FLORANE C that no body disturbs you there are vendors selling so many things on this beach and other beaches in Bali ... jewellery , hair braiding , popcorn , tatoos etc but nonetheless , the beaches are clean and quiet.food options are limited as the restaurants are a bit far away but you can have a chilled bintang and enjoy."
ChilliKoala,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2014,"waves are too big for swimming, but great if you are not an expert surfer and would like to try body surfing or boogie boarding. Beach and waters are clean, and not as crowded as Kuta tend to be."
Frolane C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2013,You can stroll along the beach. It's clean. There are some wooden sofa for sunbathing. You can stay as long as you like. Nobody will disturb you. 
berti26,nottingham,Jun 2014,"better beaches in other parts of the island, but you can book a taxi for the day cheap, big W and rock bar and potato head good for sunset cocktails and music"
Amelia B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,The sand is black but that's not a major problem because you can hire a sun lounge for cheap. It's a bit difficult to relax because you are constantly being bugged by people wanting you to buy stuff although it's not as bad as Legian & Kuta.
wieke r,23 contributions,Jul 2014,"My kids love this beach because they can learn how to surf and in the afternoon walking around the beach watching ppl playing soccer, jogs, flying kites...then watching sundown sitting on a puff at the restaurant in front of the beach :) "
Kerrienat,"Mackay, Australia",Jul 2014,"Seminyak beach was a lovely way to spend the evening, great food, music, fun and relaxation. A variety of eating places offering a great variety of foodstuff at reasonable prices. Wonderful grilled fish."
Richard C,25 contributions,May 2014,"No better place to walk and watch the sunset.Try  Walking  from La Lucciola towards Kuta for an hour around 4pm, turn around and head back to La Luche for a refreshing Bintang and Mango Daquari and watch the sunset. What cold be nicer, oh yes, a refill"
sarahluni,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jun 2014,the beach of seminyak is surprisingly clean. i loved it there since there arent as many tourist and local people there as in Kuta. I was less bothered here by locals trying to sell stuff. I took surfing classes and succeded quiet well. I guess everywhere in the South of Bali you will find really good surfing teachers.
Naomi D,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,The seminyak beach area was smellier with a lot more rubbish. We walked along further towards legion and the beach was cleaner with less sewage flow onto the sand.
Ann W,"Doonan, Australia",May 2014,"Get down there early or you wont get the best spot... the sunsets are amazing to see.. and there are many different places to park your bum, the bean bags are comfortable and the sellers are cheaper then you get on the street."
WorldTravellerPerth,Perth,Jul 2014,"This main stretch of beach running across Seminyak-proper is home to dark sand and a considerable amount of rubbish. Unfortunately there are a number of creeks and storm-water drains that empty onto this vast area, meaning refuse, pollutants and excrement flood onto the sand in places.While there are [visibly] some good waves on offer, and there are a few restaurants/bars/clubs opening onto the beach, this would be one to be avoided. There are many options available on the island, and - coupled with the persistent 'salespeople' offering a variety of beach-side up-sells (e.g. board-hire, sun-bed hire, trinkets) - this is not a good one."
Yiya68,"Darwin, Australia",Jun 2014,"I have been to Bali a few times and this is the bets that I have seen Seminyak Beach.  It was mostly clean and overall a nice experience.  Love the bars by the beach, I reccomend Ku De Ta.  The beach sellers can be a bit pushy and the banana lounge prices can have a big range in price so shop around and bargain with them.  No toilets unless  you go to a bar."
Michael R,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,"Along the 2km stretch of beach at Seminyak, there are about 5 or 6 storm water / creeks that flow into the ocean. They are all polluted with rubbish and raw sewage. the stench is disgusting and the unless you're a surfer on a board and can paddle out, swimming in that is asking for dysentery. The council / government really needs to invest in proper sewerage treatment otherwise tourists are just not going to come back. Go to south to Balantan or much further north to swim in the brochure / website photos or swim in your own villa's pool."
SandeepKale,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2014,"Visited this beach during sunset. Nice beach to spend some time in the evening. There is live music, it wasn‚Äôt much crowed."
MMichels,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jul 2014,I was totally disappointed when arrived at Seminyak beach. The sand was filthy and smelt bad. I spend just some minutes there and decided to go back to hotel. 
Jackie H,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,There's heaps of great beach bars along this strip.Lots to look at but way to many blokes handing out those stupid cards. grrrr.
Edyta R,"Gouda, The Netherlands",Jun 2014,"Another disappointment in Bali... Don't bother to come over, stinky, poor surroundings, a lot of dogs (make sure you walk around with shoes on!)."
Pasbuc,"Basel, Switzerland",Jun 2014,"Seminyak Beach has a few nice little restaurants right on the beach. Even though it is a bit touristy...the food is good and the price value ratio is also good. Had some fantastic fresh red snapper for dinner and the atmosphere around the restaurants was quite chilled out! When the sunset is happening quite a lot people sit around, eat and drink something and are watching the sunset - not bad at all! "
Alex B,"Island of Malta, Malta",Apr 2014,"Not a fan of this beach to be honest. It wasn't crowded when I went which was a plus, but it isnt as appealing as other beaches.Fee to use the sun loungers but  this is pretty standard."
Champersmk,"Melton Mowbray, UK",Jun 2014,"Watching the crashing waves, lounging on sunbeds, sipping ice-cold sodas. Clear blue water, friendly people and soft sand"
haminchung,"Seoul, Seoul, South Korea",Jun 2014,"But maybe the worst place if you plan a swimming or snorkelling.At sunset, you can take a arcane photos"
vee_vita,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"At a very busy season like the end of June to August, Seminyak beach is still better than Kuta as it's lee crowded. You can find many sun beds by the beach with paying 50k for a pair of them. Many sellers (accessories to masseuse) will prob come over to where you sit to offer their stuffs. You can avoid this in the evening (about 4 pm and after) when the cafes by the beach are open, you can sit in the bean bag for free (just order some drinks or food, ofc). The beach itself, you can deft learn to surf there as it is flat and good for beginner. The sand - unlike the description here in TA - is black sparkling volcanic sand instead of white. Sunset is quite nice here."
Les M,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,dissapointed with this. Overcrowded noisy and not value for money or particularly nice. Save your money for other places
nogenmania,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2014,in bali you can find so many beautiful beaches. Every beach had their own speciality.You can enjoy sunset here. Fantastic!
CarrieAnnBurgess,"Buderim, Australia",Jun 2014,Loved the ability to get away from the peddlers (if you want) after strolling around town and just relax sipping on a nice Bintang at the great resting point of Ku De Ta!
Matty T,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2014,The sunset here is breathtaking and there are many places along the way you can see it. Staying away from the stalls on the beach is highly recommended. There are many very famous bars along the beach which have great food and music. But be aware some require men to wear t-shirts and not singlets.
Arrael H,"New York City, NY",Jun 2014,"Easy to get to, goes for miles and there's restaurants/bars every few feet to dip into when you need a bite to eat or drink. Renting an umbrella and a chair is a must. Be warned, you will be harassed by locals selling goods all day. "
Emilia_L86,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"So my friend and I explored seminyak, nusa dua, jimbaran beaches... And we concluded seminyak was the best, the waters were the cleanest and clearest, and with the restaurants by the beaches to chill out to it was the best. The others were dirty with litter and part of isolated and boring areas. "
Vasantha,27 contributions,Jun 2014,"As we stayed in Seminyak the beach was just a 5 minute walk from our hotel. We decided to go there to catch the sunset. And on the day we went, it was a beautiful low tide with the sunset reflecting on the wet sand. it was the most beautiful scenery i ever captured! And as most of the tourists were at the beachside bars and restaurants it was not crowded at the water at all. Probably it wasnt safe too. But i just wanted to wet my feet by the shore and i could do that for a short while before the waves got a bit wild and i moved out! Best place to go to if you want to capture some nice sunset."
YC74,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2014," Relaxing and beautiful scenery. Great for surfing and sun bathing. Beautiful long sandy beach, Fresh air and can be romantic place and Scenery for honeymooners :) great place to visit "
whisker11,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Seminyak beach is a surfer's beach and not really for swimming. The waves can be huge and the undercurrent strong. During low tide, you can probably walk out quite far in waist deep water although the waves might still knock you off your feet.  There are a number of peddlers but this is no where near as annoying as the ones you find in Samui or Phuket. The great thing about the beach is there are no parasailing or jet ski operators spoiling the beach with noise and gasoline. You could just lay a beach towel on the sand, or pay private operators to rent a padded lounge chair and umbrella which is what we did in the end. It's a lot more comfortable for a few dollars an hour. "
Australiantraveller7,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,"there are many places to eat, have drinks, view the sunset and have a massage. You do get asked to buy on the beach but it's not intrusive and will leave you alone if you say no. Everyone's really so friendly"
Georgia,"Manchester, UK",Jun 2014,Spent majority of our time in Seminyak on this beach.. Perfect place to grab breakfast at one of the beach bars watching the sea/surfers.. Then sunbathe on a bed which is next to nothing in cost.. The option of surfing is there but if you don't want to you can go in the sea without being bothered by surfers.. At about 5pm all the large bean bags come out and umbrellas with lights ready for sunset with a couple of bars playing music. It was perfect to grab a couple of drinks and some tapas on the bean bags watching the sun go down..

Micachou,"Austin, TX",Jun 2014,"Now I have read some reviews about this beach being dirty and seen the pictures too.  It really has to so with timing your visit. Apparently, in the winter the currents bring tones of trash that has been churning across the sea and dumps it on the beaches in large quantities.  When I visited in June, the beaches were very clean.  From the end of May until November, I am told, is the best time to visit.  Even so, I witnessed beach cleaners through out the day, cleaning the sand of things not just washed up, but things left by beach goers.  We have to be responsible visitors, too.  There was very little litter, that I could see and I spent two entire days there. There are people trying to sell you things, but hey, it's a living.  You can say no, put on head phones, stick your head in your book, or juts ignore them.  I rented a chair for the day, and had a great time.  If I wanted fresh pineapple, a cool drink or a sarong, someone would be by to offer one for sale.  I would recommend giving it a try.  "
claguey1,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2014,"wide open beach, however open sewer nearby which flows straight into the sea, so you MUST swim upstream. Usual litter prevails, not so blighted by hawkers"
Macarena G,"Santiago, Chile",Jun 2014,"When the tide is up, there is no beach sand to stay so you HAVE to rent chairs or beds, there is also too many people trying to sale fake goods, bracelets and more."
JEC306,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,"The restaurant with bean bags on the sand had great food and for $3 per bag, you can stay all day.  The surf is good, if a little dangerous.  So many Aussies, thought we were at Lorne!!"
HdC1006,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,Not a very clean beach with broken glass and many dogs running along in groups.  Also does not look too safe in the ocean.  I would not recommend thinking this will be a beach holiday.  Unless you are looking at it from a poolside seat in one of the hotels opposite!
Jo T,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,"Loved sitting in the bean bags on the beach, sipping cocktails and watching the sunset - great atmosphere :) "
1800hammer,"Central Coast, NSW, Australia",May 2014,"I have to say, I wasn't impressed with Seminyak Beach. I just can't put my finger on it. Was it the putrid sand, the litter strewn from one end to the other, the broken glass? I even saw a guy with a dog throwing a light bulb into the ocean for the dog to retrieve, yep - a lightbulb!. Of course on one toss it broke and sunk for some unsuspecting person to cut their foot open on.It's not even pretty to look at, and doesn't compare to the thousands of golden beaches we have here in Oz."
angiegala24,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,We sat here about 3 times- just outside KUDeTA.  The life guards were never watching the water - probably because the flags were never up thus  we weren't allowed to swim here.  The people with the chairs and drinks stand were horrible- prices changing daily and they constantly wanted to know when you would be moving on.    Kudeta is great  therefore we started sitting on the lounges and ordering our drinks- much better than sitting on the beach.  Better service and environment 
Sean E,7 contributions,May 2014,"Nearest to the hotel so I went there.. Relaxing water and laid back feeling.. Not many shopping areas along the beach, have to go to the Seminyak street to do it"
Russell087,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2014,"People were swimming in this not very clean, black sandy beach but I'd prefer not too. there are dangerous rips and undertows as well - better swimming elsewhere."
Angela L,222 contributions,Jun 2014,"The endless shoreline, the great sunset and the amazing waves.Surfer not not, you will enjoy this beach. Stroll along the beach with its soft sand, waves, or go for a run. "
Theresia S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2014,"i love seminyak better than kuta beach. because it's not as crowded as kuta. it was breezy and calm. i spent my entire evening here, from 3 to 7 PM. i cant swim, so the red signage flags--that given warn about swimming prohibited area--didn't affect me at all :D they rent the chair (and the umbrella) for approximately IDR 50.000 - IDR 70.000. and it was sooo cozy. imo, truly a perfect place to see sunset."
rageshree,"New Delhi, India",May 2014,"The seminyak beach is  much better than kuta (not overly crowded) just relax, sip coconut water...dont fall for the massages they offer at the beach. try bakso...it's great. the sunset is also beautiful.  "
A F,45 contributions,May 2014,"Red flags mark areas off- limits to swimmers because of dangerous tides.  We also were concerned by polluted water flowing into the ocean at several points.  One must cross through these foul smelling streams to keep walking along the beach.  otherwise, great for surfers.  Best to go to beach clubs along the water."
Hakim H,15 contributions,Nov 2013,It was breezy and just wonderful. Very good place to chill at night. The waves are just awesome. Worth to visit in Bali if you're around. 
BJohnC,"Stroud, UK",May 2014,"A lovely flat beach several kilometres long to amble along, in early morning or late afternoon you'll see the beautifully styles fishing boats being pushed out into the waves - quite a sight.  In the evening restaurants spread accross the beach, fish is really good.  Make sure you haggle, if in a group a plate of various fish and shell fish is good value and they'll usually discount. Use anti-bug spray on legs and ankles to avoid bites - not a huge problem but common on sand.  "
Kavita,"Mumbai, India",May 2014,"Very few vendors chewing your brains trying to sell beads, massages or kites and stuff...deck chairs at IDR 50,000 for 2 for 2hours, brilliant waves for surfing with a few good looking men doing so, clean beach with black sand....we will be back"
Annie Gan,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2013,"Nice beach but bit crowded in high season. There is massage, water sport and small stall seliing pario, food, drinks and etc"
willpickford,"London, UK",May 2014,"Part of the huge stretch of sand that hugs the south western side of the island, Seminyak beach is far nicer - and less developed -that Legion and Kuta further south. Head here for a quieter - and more sophisticated experience."
Hazcom,10 contributions,Mar 2014,"not my type of Bali, very fake, upperclass want to be's, I love seminyak , lived there for 3 years but too many people thinking they pay too much so they must own the place and the locals, locals get treated like underpaid slaves here in their own country"
Excalibur340,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,The beach itself......so many bar by the beach.....love the idea of watching sunset on a beanbag with ur favorite drink or cocktail and not forgetting the music.....it's just drive u....
nicklamport,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2014,"I guess coming from Australia it's hard to find good beaches compared to what we have back home, however I was truly shocked at the state of Seminyak Beach. The rubbish was piled up on the beach, mostly plastic bottles. The water was filthy as well with rubbish in it. I couldn't believe people were actually swimming and sunbathing on the beach. I will not be returning, there are much better beaches, cleaner beached around Asia."
AngAmanda,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2014,"This is a very clean beach and great for just lying down to tan, surfing, or even renting a beach chair with umbrella. The downside would be hawkers trying to sell various things (shades, shawls etc.) to you while you're lying on the beach. There are little bars selling food like sandwiches, desserts and drinks along the beach too."
Kaz S,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2014,I did love this beach while I was there. I've been to a few in Kuta but this one is quieter and I felt a lot more relaxed there
Jana S,"London, UK",May 2014,"Great, clean and long beach for lovely walk. Lots of locals trying to sell all sort of stuff, but one ""no"" takes care of them. They don't keep harassing. Lots of fancy bars along the beach. Sea can bit little rough at times"
flyrobfly,"Leeds, UK",May 2014,"This was actually my favourite beach in Bali (including Lombok and Gillis). It is wide and long, beautiful views. You can sunbath anywhere you fancy or hire a sun lounger for 100,000 for the full day. Lots of nice cafes and it is hive of activity in the evening with many many nice restaurants. Also worthy of note is that it is an excellent surfer beach, for beginners or professionals! The waves break quite far out giving you a really long surf back in."
piyuko,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Dec 2013,"Unfortunately saw this beach on our last day stay in bali and got very less to enjoy there.But truely, its beautiful and very clean.You feel so relaxed."
LynetteAnne M,6 contributions,May 2014,Waves crashing beautiful scenery. Lots of people and friendly. Very clean and seating provided was adequate. White waves and we could see the storm coming in to cool down our day. It rained very heavy two nights in a row. It definitely cooled down when rain came. Lots of people swimming at the beach. Some fishing in the evening.
Celinechan,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",May 2014,"This is a much better beach than Kuta Beach. Its much cleaner and bigger. Loads of lounge chairs and surf boards for rent. The beach sand is quite dark compared to Thai beaches. As for the waves, i'm not brave enough to go near them."
Lombok Friendly,"Lombok, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"This is maybe not the best beach in Bali, but it is the best place to watch the sunset. I spend every weekend either swimming or just watch the beautiful sunset."
Pankaj7269,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2014,"Seminyak beaches are quiet but not very clean, I would say, but less crowded, less shops around but great beach side dining area, offers lovely music & soothing experience."
Tsj A,"Toronto, Canada",Mar 2014,"We know Bali is not about beaches only, but we found Seminyak Beach very average. We have been to many more scenic beaches in many different countries. But if you want a place to sit at a beach side caf√© and relax for a few hours, it does the trick. I would not recommend going in the water, though."
bonjourajat,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2013,i liked the privacy and cleanliness of beach with a less curvy surface compared to kuta beach. You can really have a relaxed time here in lesser crowd and more beautiful view than kuta
Laura,London,Apr 2014,"Chill out down the end at the beach bars, bean bag hop along and listen to live music.  We watched a wedding too, great spot for people watching :-)"
Bungchow,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2014,"The day we went the beach was quite clean, there hadnt been any rain the week we were there so i guess we were lucky. This definately isnt a white sand beach, its the regular black/brown sand you find in legian/kuta as well. There is plenty of places to eat along the beach and plenty of sun lounges to rent, we paid 10k for two for the day. The water is nice, there are plenty of waves, but its not a real good place for kids or the inexperienced to swim, there are several big rips and a strong current. While we were there 2 guys got pulled out the back behind the waves while everyone sat around and watched, there are no lifesavers here, eventually someone swam out to help them swim back in. You dont get hassled as much here as you do in Kuta but there are still plenty of hawkers walking the beach, but its bali and u come to expect that. Overall its an ok beach for a days swimming and people watching but i wouldnt recommend it for young kids or inexperienced swimmers, stick to sand castles"
wtnewell,"seattle, wa",Jun 2013,"The water is a little murky, and the sand is a dirty brown, but the waves are nice and this is a fun for playing in the water."
Rodney P,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2014,"The dirty beach in colour and with rubbish as well as filthy deck chairs, although the little bars sell cold bitang beer and are cheaper than in town "
pbuzzoni,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco",Jan 2014,"Let me say that I am still impressed for the beaches of Bali, but in the unbelievable way.Nobody from the western world could ever imagine the images you are about to see.Folks, just check the pictures..."
Nicole C,"Zurich, Switzerland",Mar 2014,"the beach and the ocean where so dirty, you literally swim through plastic. they are trying to clean the beach up, but there's so much rubbish, that it looks the same every morning :-( rather take the time and drive half an hour up north or south... its clean and beautiful"
Michelle,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2014,"So much better than kuta beach - much cleaner, better surf and less crowed - another bonus is less people trying to sell you useless things "
Tangmaster,"Lancelin, Australia",Mar 2014,"Seminyak is the only location with a number of bars right on the beach, providing bean bags/umbrellas, food, cold drinks & evening music to go along with the sensational sunsets. Try the Champlung Bar amongst others for a great early evening treat."
richardsmyname,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2014,"The beach has pretty strong waves and with the dark looking sand, just isn't that inviting to lay on. There are areas where the beach looks quite dirty and littered with garbage. We intended to spend some time on the beach in Seminyak, but after looking at it, decided not to. "
Jocaloda,"Geneva, Switzerland",Apr 2014,"Already reviewed this in my hotel review. Flagged off zones for swimming but no lifeguards in those areas. No hawkers as all the roaming sellers were pleasant. Nice sand, no coral,or rocks under a raging but fun sea. Bodyboarding and surfing great fun."
Jay M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,I'm always disappointed by Seminyak beach. It's not always clean.  Sometimes the hawkers get really annoying. 
Reb2908,Mauritius,Apr 2014,Clean and wonderful waves crashing us back on the shore. Really nice sand and awesome sunset view. Availability of beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach itself for a good price. amazing experience.
Weechi89,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Apr 2014,Having beers along the beach.quite good but people keep on selling thingsoffering good masssage but it actually need to negotiate with them. coz i was offered with 50k for neck massage only.
Pravin T,Darjeeling,Apr 2014,Clean and neat beach with restaurants all around. Amazing sunset and view. Having dinner on the beach was an incredible experience.
Maxwellk24,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2014,"As with all the beaches north of Kuta,forget about golden sands,forget about clean beaches forget about clean swimming.Unless you are staying at a top hotel,the condition of the beach is totally reliant on the previous high tide.The beach will either be spotlessly clean or littered with so much rubbish you would be inclined to think you are wallowing in a rubbish tip.And the ocean at times is not fit for swimming with oil slicks polluting the water and the sand.Given all that negativity,to walk in the sort of serenity that a sunset beach provides is more than relaxing and the sunsets can be awesome."
John H,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2014,"Very wide and clean and the water nice and warm, with very few local sellers, not that it was a problem, nice people"
raya1303,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Mar 2014,Like an idiot I got up and went to the beach only to realize that its not the best place to expect sunrise!!! lolz. But it was nice and calm. 
WorldboyMarco,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",Apr 2014,"So if you like strolling on the beach at sunset, or enjoying extended beachside lunches, Seminayak is the place to be. The beach is wide and the surf is good if you have the skills. Swimmers are advised to only swim between the red and yellow flags, not where there are red flags, due to the rips or large waves. There is a good choice of beach bars, clubs and restaurants for day or night-time entertainment. Good for people watching. Can be windy though."
Guinness1961,"Shenyang, China",Apr 2014,"We spent late afternoon and early evening at this beach. Mixed feelings. The water and sunset were stunning. The view of the beach was very disappointing. There was garbage all along the beach. What a shame, this is such a beautiful area and should be more cared for by everyone. We had to watch where we were walking to avoid the mess. We got some great pictures of the sunset."
Lisa S,Gold Coast,Apr 2014,Beautiful place to go on sunset- We sat on bean bags and sipped cocktails and had dinner there. They also play live music.highly recommend it!
Donna D,"Mudgee, Australia",Apr 2014,"The sunset was beautiful, beach had a fair bit of rubbish on it. So different to Aussie beaches. I did not swim just went for a walk up the beach so did 300 other people to watch the sunset."
KennyYVR,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2014,"This probably isn't a well warranted review, based on experience, but here goes!  We walked to Seminyak Beach from our villa in the Jalan Kunti 1 area (near to Bali Deli), the first night we arrived to Bali.  We've been here a month - give or take - and I have not returned.  Early evening, and it's about a 20 minute, winding walk through the streets of Grosinyak to get there.  We arrive to find, not so much a beach, but more akin to a newly started landfill.  Plastic, garbage, washed up debris of all sorts, littering the beach and floating in the water.  Not exactly a Kodak moment!  And yet - swimmers, surfers and sun worshipers galore!  I guess it's that ""when in Rome"" mentality?  (I'd rather just go to Rome!)  Oh wait!  I lie!  We did walk the beach a second time during a pouring rain storm, which was a million times better as there were only a handful of folks around, and clean-up crews were hard at work which was great to see, but limited to the beach-fronts of the fancy hotels.  My concern on that day - what the hell is hiding in that grey water that flows from the klongs - directly in to the sea???  Shameful!"
Jialong,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2014,"I have been to many beaches all over the world, and this one is pretty special in its own way. Although the sand are pretty dark and looks like mud when its wet, but the reflections at about 6 to 7pm were beautiful! You can see your own reflections or even those of the clouds when the tide is low. Probably one of the more beautiful beaches in the world (when there's not too many people)."
Belinda H,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,Went for long walks and beach runs. Can't say I was crazy for the beach. Get quite irritated if I just want to sit down and have a glass of wine and hawkers are constantly there trying to sell you their wares. Plenty of places to sit down and enjoy a meal or drink. 
Valerie B,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Mar 2014,A lovely wide beach with rolling surf. Good to see graders out each morning cleaning up the beachfront. Many cafes nearby. Lovely breezes as you walk.
anna318,"serangoon gardens,s'pore",Mar 2014,We reached the beach before sunset so we somewhat avoided the crowd but reached in time to catch the sunset. BEAUTIFUL
Renilicious,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2014,Visited this beach one time only during our recent stay a few hundred metres up the road. Terrible experience.Upon approaching the beach we were instantly bombarded by local women trying to braid our hair and sell clothing etc. They were extremely pushy and would not take no for an answer and grabbed my daughters hair and started to braid it expecting to be paid. And they were way over priced. But get sucked in. The beach was dirty and not a pleasant place at all. I definately would not swim in the water.
Geraldine P,"Ipswich, UK",Mar 2014,Althought there is an attempt to clean the beach everyday the sea is full of rubbish and it is deposited every high tide.  Walking in the sea is not pleasant as rubbish wraps itself around your legs
chmeee5,"Blackburn, Australia",Mar 2014,"The beach itself was really great; beautiful sand, good looking surf and excellent views around the bay. The environs however, left much to be desired. There is rubbish/garbage everywhere along the beach-side streets and around the vendor areas just onto the beach.It's such a shame really because once away from that area it really is beautiful."
Debbiea21,"Niddrie, Australia",Mar 2014,"Really clean beach, fantastic to just stroll along and wet your feet. Many caf√©s to stop along the way for a quick drink or a bit to eat."
AlexGourmetraveller,"Athens, Greece",Jan 2014,"The beach is full of toxic garbage coming from the city with the rain flow. Others say that they come from the ocean from the fishing boats. No matter how they come its a terrible view (see 2 pics attached), people come with trucks and clean it every afternoon but they are so many that they can t do anything about it‚Ä¶ or many they can? educate their people not tho throw garbage anywhere? of course this takes decades, meantime enjoy the little bar/restaurants on the beach which some of them have gray food!"
Ailmarsh,"East Kilbride, UK",Mar 2014,Ate good quality 'tapas' in Bar La Plancha. ........we live in Spain & didn't expect Spanish style food on a beach in Bali!
GrandmaFunk,"Holsworthy, UK",Mar 2014,"I can't believe how much crap there is on this beach - mostly plastics. Sometimes you'd see people scraping it up, but not enough to make much of a difference. Having stayed in Sanur a couple of times previously, where the beaches are pretty immaculate, this came as a nasty shock. Also, not good for swimming as the currents are strong. Good for surfers though - nice breaks."
butterbeat,Singapore,Mar 2014,Sand was grey and the water had millions of small plastic bits floating around in it. The foam was actually yellow! Will never come back nor recommend.
Eddie D,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"We came here around 10 am, which is pretty hot around that time. We cant buy anything because there was no street vendor yet. The beach little bit dirty, but still nice place to hang out."
Jazzventures,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2013,We didnt stay here for even 5mins we got turned off from all the rubbish on the beach and it was upsetting to see it the way it was
sammiejoe89,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2014,"I didn't even want to swim because of the garbage floating everywhere! The waves were huge though so pretty good for surfing as long as you don't mind landing in a load of floating wrappers etc! if you just want to chill with a beer on the sand this is pretty standard, you can get a cheap bintang from a few vendors instead of paying extra at the bars."
Adam C,7 contributions,Jul 2013,It's just another awesome beach to kick off your shoes and find somewhere to stop for lunch or dinner. 
Pamela A,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2014,"The beach is not for swimming just walk along the beach, dog walking or just pick a spot to sit and watch the sunset!"
Shasharina,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Mar 2014,"As lovely as the weather was in Bali last week, the one thing I just could not stay silent about is how dirty the beach was. There were rubbish that formed a tide line here on Seminyak, and also along Kuta. It was such an eye sore. And worse, true to its name, there were oil slicks coming in with the waves. Seminyak in bahasa means ""one oil"". I guess Bali really didnt want to disappoint. If you want the beach, go elsewhere. Heard Sanur is far better...or even Nusa Dua....or anywhere else, but...But if you dont want the beach, then why even go to Bali? I just had the misfortune of not doing enough research about the island. Probably deluded by the many glorified romantic tales - blame eat pray love for that! But if you seek to just chill and unwind, then, this island is ideal. And this part of Kuta (contrary to popular belief, Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is in reality ONE area) is the quieter portion. Food wise? For Asians, it's not really value for money at all. Drinks are rather pricey too. Shopping for the ladies? Sure...Bangkok's cheaper. Heck, even KL is far cheaper. Nightlife? In Seminyak? They only have 2 options, apart from dinner. One is the high end restaurants-turn-club-after-dinner, the other...well, if you dont swing the other way, and do not like diva shows, then hail a cab and hit Jalan Legian, Kuta instead.But the one thing I enjoyed Seminyak for was the hospitality at the hotel and restaurants I went to. But probably an advantage that I can speak Indonesian."
Hal E,"Chicago, IL",Mar 2014,"The beach is wide and flat and the water is warm. The sand can get hot, however. On this side of Bali the rip current (undertow) is quite strong so be very careful when swimming."
Maria P,"Perm, Russia",Mar 2014,Nice long beautiful beach!I highly recommend to go to La plancha beach bar for the sunset!Sunsets are just incredible on bali!
Simon M,"London, UK",Mar 2014,"A tide line of rubbish stretching from Seminyak to Kuta with dogs fouling on top of the trash. When it gets windy more rubbish blows in from Java, which covers the beach in bottles and plastic."
sisca h,"Pulau Ubin, Singapore",Aug 2013,very beautiful beach we could enjoy the sunset while enjoying a cup of tea in the cafe. Only five minutes from our hotel stay.
Cruisin57,"Perth, Australia",May 2013,Please be very careful swimming at this beach very strong rips.  We were there on the Saturday and a girl nearly drowned the lifesavers did not spot her straight away however another surf board rider came to her rescue they had to resuscitate her and then off to the hospital she was not looking very good.  Another man went in after her and he had to be helped back in from the Lifesavers as well if not for their efforts I feel both would have drowned - well done to those who helped.
EDEN_BALI,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2013,Its simply the best beach along Seminyak and Petitenget temple.. we have so many option to go dining there.. the beach is very clean and Lots of Ceremonial event Happen there at all week..Reccommended....
fachroudane,"Kediri, Jawa Timur, Indonesia",Apr 2013,"sunset on the beach of Seminyak is charming, the people are very friendly and does not cost much to do this tour"
AngelinaK656,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2013,"we greatly enjoyed the time with our family at the beach. and we stopped at one of the cafe's in seminyak  while looking at the beautiful sunset. It was late, we continue to shop in the area seminyak. A very impressive."
kormensandiego,"Manila, Philippines",Mar 2013,"The views are great here, you can have a quiet stroll without bumping into too many people like Kuta for example.  The only thing I disliked was that even in this part of the beach, which is supposedly the most upscale, there are still small patches of garbage seen on the sides.Nice place to catch a beach offering ceremony in the morning, with local men and women coming from the nearby Pura Petitenget."
Daryllee84,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2013,Nothing special about the beach to be honest... many people were there but it wasn't really clean or pretty to begin with. The nearby areas are very crowded. 
BenAlana2013,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2013,"Beautiful and peaceful, the beach is clean...with one of Bali's best restaurants located right there - La Lucciola!! Absolutely wonderful!"
Geetika T,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2013,"Very clean beach , not very crowded i think thats what makes it different ...had an amazing time there ."
GRT7V,"Cottingham, UK",Jan 2013,Worse beaches I have ever winessed and I have visited more than 70 countries. Paradise Bali is not! Rubbish is all over the beach. Some of it piled up for the tide to take it out and hey presto...bring it in again.
Globegallop,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",Dec 2012,"Beautiful position and setting, We go there every time we are in Bali and have not been disappointed yet.An oldie but a goodie!"
Alejandra C,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",Jan 2013,"The beach was clean and the water was nice although compared to other beaches in Bali it wasn¬¥t as clear, but it could have been the tide. There where a lot of people there when we went, so it wasn¬¥t as enjoyable as it could have been. "
kk506,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2012,go there sit down and take in the view of the sun setting down. worth it. make sure you're there by 06:30 PM
TheAussieExplorers,"Albury, Australia",Nov 2012,A must for a romantic dinner in seminyak! Great food and service overlooking the beach! Highly recommended!
WouterBaliIndonesia,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Aug 2012,Great beach but with one of the polluted rivers ending here and the growing amount of people simply no good for me.
Rors47,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2012,"The beach is great place just to laze around, it is really quite clean probably due to the Seminyak area. There are only a few people trying to sell their goods and they are respectful leaving you once you have said ""no thank you""."
William50H,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Sep 2012,"Went there in the evening, great view of the sunset, nice breeze as you see couples and families enjoying themselves, plus it a 10 mins walk away to Ku De Ta!"
sakticleaver,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2011,"Unlike the kuta beach which is dirty and crowded most of the time, you can expect a peaceful, clean and quite beach. A good place for a walk and some self-serenity. Definitely worth the visit if you need some relaxation"
ShishaLady,Singapore,Jul 2012,"Reasonably clean. Nice to walk along this beach. When tired, you can stop at any of the cafes lining the beach. Especially like sunsets at La Lucciola Restaurant"
C L,Bandar Seri Begawan,Jul 2012,"Quieter clean end of the waterfront, but be prepared to be hassled by vendors selling you all sorts of knick-knacks.  Stay firm, they'll go away after 15 mins!  "
Manager_Janet,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2012,Sad to say the beaches along Seminyak are looking more polluted than ever with what appears to be human waste in the water.La Lucciola has a nice location but when you arrive at Seminyak's main beach opposite Cocoon you can see a big brown tide of sludge in the already brown water.The storm water drainage at many points along Seminyak's beaches into the ocean looks as though you may contract something if you come in contact with it.
