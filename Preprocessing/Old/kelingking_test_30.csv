Jun 2017,"Kelingking Beach is about 30 mins from Crystal Beach by scooter. The middle part of the journey is quite bumpy due to the notoriously pothole-filled roads, which get better closer to the destination. Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat). I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled). Both the descent and ascent are quite laborious, and the pocari sweat back up top was welcomed gladly. This experience was unbelievable. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Sep 2019,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn.

Apr 2018,"Overall, it is a pain in the butt for a modest pay-off. The infrastructure on Nusa Penida is over-run with tourists. 8 of 10 vehicles that are beating the roads into a bombed-out wasteland are tourist vans, vying to keep two wheels on the pavement and hopefully two wheels on the shoulder.

From the top you can see amazing views of the beach and you can even spot manta ray fish, we could see at least 4. Then we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so we can swim in beautiful turquoise sea and play in the white soft sand. However, there was almost no stairs, it was more similar to climbing a rocky mountain, it was very steep, long, and challenging. Wearing a shoe for this hike is a must. The first half of the broken stairs was fine but the other half was definitely harder, no stairs, only broken rocks to step on. I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs. After finally reaching the bottom, it was all still beautiful, but the sea was also rough, high waves and strong tide, so it was hard to relax in the sea. In the beach there was only one small place selling some drinks and snacks. Overall, it was definitely very beautiful, the view and scene was amazing.

Oct 2018,"Obviously I saw a photo of Kelingking Beach on Instagram about 2 years ago, and ever since then I knew I had to go see it. Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able.

May 2019,"Kelingking Beach is a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island. You can enjoy one of the most breath-taking views over the hills and small strip of white sand from atop a hill of the same name. The sight features a limestone headland covered in green, against the deep blue waters of the open Indian Ocean. This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‘T-Rex Bay’. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it’s during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you’ve reached the sand, you’ll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated. You can combine your visit to Kelingking Beach with a visit to an interesting temple nearby. Pura Paluang Temple is a couple of minutes’ ride east by motorbike, and features shrines in the shape of cars!",kelingking hidden village bunga mekar southwestern coast nusa penida island enjoy one breathtaking view hill small strip white sand atop hill name sight feature limestone headland cover green deep blue water open indian ocean unique formation reminiscent tyrannosaurus rex head nickname trex bay seclude rugged 400m cliffside hike recommend fit adventurousenjoying scenic seascape take photos selfies sufficient enjoy sweep view purposebuilt platform border bamboo fence dare challenge trek make sure low tide section path steep require bit rock climb especially way back local put rock bamboo aid visitor year youve reach sand youll time depend tide condition water swimmable note undercurrent strong remote site lifeguard around besides camera good pair shoe sure bring drink water descent keep hydrate combine visit kelingking visit interesting temple nearby pura paluang temple couple minute ride east motorbike feature shrine shape car,"{'neg': 0.013, 'neu': 0.793, 'pos': 0.194, 'compound': 0.9756}",0.9756,positive

I put stairs quotations because it is in fact a narrow, steep, and uneven pathway made of jagged rocks and a hand-fashioned bamboo rail. The descent and climb back to the top were quite taxing and I would not encourage it for anyone with poor physical health.Unfortunately the beach is very wavy with strong currents so you are unable to fully get in to the water at the beach.

There were lot of tourists on top of the beack too, but not so many that you couldn't just take in the views and enjoy.There are some scams (at least they feel like scams) on the beach by locals, so be aware. Our guide actually adviced us couple of times to climb ladders into this little wooden thing, where you could take selfies with a better view. So we did althought the wooden thing didn't look so special. When we came down, the local lady was asking us for 5 k per person. It was written with a shaky handwriting on a very little sign next to the ladders. We paid, as it isn't that much, but I just felt fooled. I feel like this kind of ""take a picture here and pay 5/10 k"" are just one big scam. Entrance fees are okay if the proceeds go into the maintenance/property management, but otherwise...
