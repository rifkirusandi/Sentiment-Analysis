Jun 2019,Visited this beach after enduring a boat ride that had to be boarded on the beach. With the waves pounding the beach it was quite a scary encounter to get on board. To get to the beach we had a driver who took us over some horrendous roads that caused me to have a sore back for several weeks. When we got there to view the beach it was loverly but as usual crowded with lots of people. I definitely wouldn’t be going back. I felt sorry for the people who hired scooters. The roads were bad enough in the car.  The roads were horrendous all over the island. Not what I would call a pleasant visit. The boat trip going back we had to get off the boat at the beach with the same difficulty. ,visit endure boat ride board wave pound quite scary encounter board driver take u horrendous road cause sore back several week get view loverly usual crowd lots people definitely wouldnt go back felt sorry people hire scooter road bad enough car road horrendous island call pleasant visit boat trip go back boat difficulty,"{'neg': 0.286, 'neu': 0.579, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': -0.8748}",-0.8748,negative

Oct 2018,"Obviously I saw a photo of Kelingking Beach on Instagram about 2 years ago, and ever since then I knew I had to go see it. Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able. I could have done it in flip flops, but I didn't want to ditch my husband lol.Beyond the actual views, there are a bunch of warungs where you can get food and drink, fresh coconut, etc. We did have to pay a small fee (15,000? 11,000 IDR?) to park our motorbike there as well, which was fine. The road to the actual beach is not paved and needs some serious work -- the east side of the island, in comparison, is *much* nicer in that regard.

There are monkeys here too so if you’re scared get someone to shoe them away for you.  There’s plenty of warungs to eat or drink at.

May 2019,"Kelingking Beach is a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island. You can enjoy one of the most breath-taking views over the hills and small strip of white sand from atop a hill of the same name. The sight features a limestone headland covered in green, against the deep blue waters of the open Indian Ocean. This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‘T-Rex Bay’. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it’s during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you’ve reached the sand, you’ll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated. You can combine your visit to Kelingking Beach with a visit to an interesting temple nearby.

The big waves and white sands are mind blowing.As the waves were big i didn't dive into but my husband went for swim. Unfortunately i was just standing nearby and feeling the waves touching my feets, suddenly a very stong wave came and just made me fall down. I was not able to getup and within a fraction of second it took me away deep.I thought i was dead. My husband came to fetch me but along with me he was also drowning. Thanks to the other foreign visitors those helped both of us from being drowned. 4 of them dragged both of us simultaneously. It was so dangerous and i was very scared. I'll never forget this accident.

Feb 2019,"The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. Kelingking beach is located on Nusa Penida, with is a separate island located about 30 minutes by boat from Sanur, Bali. Nusa Penida is still undeveloped, and I would recommend spending a few nights here to really enjoy the island. Another option would be staying on Nusa Lembongan which is only a 5 minute boat ride away from Penida, it has more accommodation options available (in total their are 3 Nusa Islands all located next to each other). Note: It's takes about 30 minutes to get down to the actual beach at Kelingking, but around 1-1.5 hrs to climb back up. The stairs are steep and rocky, not the easiest climb. Their are hand rails most of the way, would not recommend the climb for anyone with mobility or endurance issues. Many people simply come and take pictures from the top without ever climbing down to the water. And that works fine for all fitness/mobility levels. It's a very popular spot, get there early if you can to avoid the crowds. Nusa Penida is amazing, this isn't a spot to rush through in one day. They have tons of great beaches (like crystal bay), great snorkeling, and landmarks like angels billabong, broken beach, etc. The roads to get around the island are in pretty bad shape. Tons of potholes and rubble. It takes a long time to travel around the island because of the bad conditions. If you are renting a scooter be very careful on the roads.

Lot of vloggers have posted their videos online on the same topic and there are conflicting views on it. For me it was the trek which made all the difference. I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 9:30 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly. Every 5 minutes take a pause and just look around the surroundings , then you will realise why I am asking you to trek down. Once you reach down then you will see an absolutely gorgeous beach with so strong waves . This is what I am talking about. ..

Oct 2018,"It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida. It requires good physical condition to go up, down and up again, especially under the tropical sun. It's located quite far, 1,5 hour approximately from Sampalan, the main port to reach Nusa Penida from Sanur. Because of its popularity, to avoid the crowd, I suggest you to be here around 8 am. The earliest fast boat leaves Sanur at 7.30 with 45 minutes travel duration. So people start coming from Bali main island from 10 am approx. It'd be ideal if you spend a night in Nusa Penida and arrive early in Kelingking beach. So you can enjoy the white sandy, secluded beach on your own for some time. You take steepy stairs to go down that only fit for one person. In the busy hours, people make quite long queue waiting to go up or down in turns, one by one. The shower room isn't available on the beach, it's on the cliff. You should pay 5000 IDR to use the shower room/toilet.I wonder how grand the view would be during sunset time.

Jan 2018,"We visited Kelingking in January, the off season and most quiet time of year for tourism, expecting to get there and find it largely empty.  After negotiating the treacherous roads by scooter (and I mean treacherous- we witnessed a bad accident only the day after), we arrived to find about 30/40 other tourists there, which is a lot given the limited amount of cliff space.  Lots had arrived in the people-carriers from resorts, which make it easy to navigate the dangerous roads and get to all of the places on the island that, otherwise, are hard to reach.  The beach is utterly stunning and completely beautiful, but be prepared to find it crowded, especially if you visit in the off-season.  There's also a very dangerous ledge that tourists were dangling off for photos!  Also, when we visited, there was a sign next to the path down to the beach warning against going down.  We ummed and ahhed about whether to risk it, but fortunately chose not to, and after doing another walk down the cliffs, I'm so glad we chose not to!

The roads are in terrible conditions at some points so I wouldn't recommend going this way unless you experienced riding. We reached Kelingking took a couple photos and without hesitation made our way down towards the beach. Let's just say going down was the easy part, The mountain is extremely steep with only some bamboo tied together with some rope to 'stop' you from falling off the edge. It is also extremely hot so take a lot of water, but don't pack too much as the climb back up the mountain can become extremely difficult if you have a lot to carry. Once you do get down to the bottom you can not enter the water, as it is dangerously rough, the waves are huge and crash right on the shore with that much power that even standing meters away you are almost swept off your feet. We were also lucky enough to be able to purchase some water and beers down the bottom as well. We made the silly mistake of drinking a beer before the climb back up which we both regretted as the climb is so hard and with a beer in your belly you do not feel good. The climb back up was exhausting, and we almost passed out from the heat a couple of times because there is absolutely no relief from the sun and we started the climb back up at 12:30 - 1:00 pm.

Dec 2017,"If you have time to spend in Bali, please pay a visit to Nusa Penida. This island is just amazingly stunning. It has multiple beaches with jaw-dropping views, totally worth to visit. One of the great options is Kelingking Beach, or the locals used to call it as Karang Dewa. It is only 45 minutes from the Nusa Penida pier by a motorbike. You can easily rent a motorbike, or hire a cab there. Totally easy.The view was completely amazing, as you can see from many pictures here. However, do not go down to the beach if you are not feeling well. It was noon (around 1 am), when I decided to go down to the beach. Actually, the locals put a warning there to not go down because the track was very steep (yeah, 90-degree cliff) it was just like a wall-climbing without any safety rope, and without any safety guards. Going down is totally at your own risk. Also, consider the time to go down and back up. When I went down it was 1 pm and it was extremely hot and even my sunblock couldn’t prevent me from sunburn. The beach itself was actually very nice, and you can swim and enjoy the view for hours. Don’t forget to bring drinks and foods because there is no food stall down there. But please, I repeat, please bring back your trash up there. If you could, please also bring some other trash there. Unfortunately, there were so many trash on the beach.

Jul 2018,"Kelingking beach is just something you have to see to believe, it is amazing. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the manta rays swimming around at the beach below. A few things to note:The road out to Kelingking is rough, if you decide to do it on a scooter you should be careful as there are a lot of bumps, rocks, soft sand and taxis to contend with. I have heard that the taxi/tour van ride out is quite rough also but if you aren't confident on a scooter then I suggest taking a tour or taxi.This is the number one attraction on Nusa Penida so it gets very busy, if you stay on the island I recommend going early before the boats bring in day tourists.The best view is from the top, but you can hike down to the beach but be warned that it is not an easy one, I recommend wearing sneakers/runners for extra grip and just for feet protection.Areas of the hike down are super steep and quite difficult to negotiate so take your time. Plenty of people do this hike so there are sections where you will have to stop and wait to let people pass you. Be considerate of others and lend them a hand when it's safe to do so. This is a cliffs side you are climbing down which has little shade and sometimes no wind so it gets very hot. Once you make it down to the beach, there is one person who is selling some drinks and snacks but don't expect to have a wide variety and you will pay slightly more then you would normally. It would be wise to take some water and snacks with you. The beach is not necessarily a swim friendly beach, no life guards patrol the beach, the waves can be quite big and come from different directions. If you aren't a strong swimmer I highly advise you don't go in very deep. I swam out into the water and got to swim with some rays which was awesome. It was hard to get in and out safely and I am a strong swimmer.This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so if you do decide to do it.

The tide is very strong but there is also a life guard pointing out the less dangerous sections.

Mar 2018,"I had been wanting to visit Nusa Penida after seeing the beautiful pictures everywhere and realizing it was just 30 minutes from Bali where I was going on vacation this past week. The reviews are accurate - this isn't an easy place to get to, and the climb is not easy either - but the view is worth it. I have never seen a place like this in my life and it IS breathtaking. We booked a tour which included a fast boat from Sanur beach to Nusa Penida and then a driver picked us up and drove us there. We could have rented motorbikes or just a taxi, but we weren't sure and were limited on time so we just got a tour guide. The fast boat was about 45 minutes, and once we arrived our tour guide immediately picked us up and started driving up Nusa Penida to the beach, which was about a 45 minute drive through long, winding, and needless to say bumpy roads. Once we arrived the views were incredible and it wasn't too touristy which was great. We decided to start the trek down, and about halfway we stopped to turn back around. To be completely honest, my legs still hurt 3 days later from the hike (and I didn't even go all the way). The hike down is not paved and has rocks and some wood to help guide you, but it's definitely scary and treacherous. I do regret not going all the way down, so if you have time - I would recommend trying it if you are fit and in shape. For me, it was about 90 degrees and I was absolutely exhausted, so I was scared about going all the way down and turned around even though I wish I hadn't.

Holding on for dear life on the floppy bamboo fencing, and gripping on the rocking sandy path. We spoke to many people on the way about it they said it was definitely an adventure. They were right. It was the most memorable adventure of Nusa Penida. It took about an hour for a group of 7 girls to get down. Once reaching the bottom the sizes of the waves become huge to you and you realise that all the hard effort you put into getting down can not be rewarded with a swim, but just a dipping of the feet. Many girls getting knocked over by the force of the waves. After a nice relaxing lie down and looking up and around what you just conquered it's time to head back up. Going barefoot up and down was what we did. And I must say with a little help from upper body strength going up was a lot easier.

Hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. 🙏🏻Besides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited.

Mar 2019,"First of all, don’t do the day trip. You must stay on this beautiful untouched island for a few days to really appreciate Nusa Penida. We came to Kelingking twice - once around 8am to take photos from the top and fly the drone. A good time to get here before the cars full of tourists turn up (usually between 830-9) From this we then planned to walk all the way down to the beach a few mornings later and we started our walk at 7am. I’d advise getting there as early as this or even earlier to firstly hike in the cooler weather before it gets too hot and secondly so you can have the whole beach to yourself! Truly amazing.The hike itself is tough. We are both athleticly for and found it a challenge. It’s mostly rock climbing and if the weather has been raining the night before it’s very slippery. Make sure you wear trainers and sensible clothes. The halfway point hike isn’t too bad but to carry on after this and go to the beach is where it gets hard.

Sep 2019,"Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins) and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot... This is dingy with rats on the rafters and you can select from 2 meals being the cheapest on the menu... This part was private as it was just me and my mum with our driver. Please take travel sickness tablets with you!!! The roads are next level horrible... I've travelled a fair bit and I have never seen roads this bad... I got car sickness in about 15 minutes... And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us. It seems noones safety is considered on this trip and in this day and age it's disappointing that so many people's life's at put at risk to make some money.",let start say truely something behold gorgeous real life noone prepare trip feel im public service provide experience nothing prepare people really happen magnificent place feel prepared experience leave sour taste mouth firstly book company find trip advisor research well nothing leave think bad excite trip tell private trip arrive fast ferry port clear wasnt private imagine maneuver rock wall 10ft high sharp wobbly extremely unsafe mum wear thong lose balance trouble pack fast ferry clearly enough life jacket everyone full people get give stool sit middle walk way ferry ride 20mins load bunch people hold sign find gentleman hold escort u another bunch people load onto another boat hand snorkel equipment private one bunch people hoard cattle snorkelling include day trip chance swim manta ray bucket list excite dont tell jump boat open ocean water right near rock face current wave huge experience swimmer felt overwhelm amount people water condition way go see manta ray rip next take another snorkel spot one protect actually quite nice use opportunity really swim enjoy take back island meet allocate driver take lunch spot dingy rat rafter select 2 meal cheapest menu part private mum driver please take travel sickness tablet roads next level horrible ive travel fair bit never see road bad get car sickness 15 minute location roughly 45 minute alot drive reach kelingking driver escort u thing hop walk short treacherous bring runner grippy shoe safetyhere see lovely now guide tell u walk take 1 hour take double walk back super tempt view gorgeous adventurer want badly try prepared water appropriate shoe swimmer towel bloody head nice miss opportunity u dont wrong driver try super helpful wasnt fault company fill u now patience wear thin guy tree try take picture sting tourist shot come now tell another hour next spot im sure handle another hour god awful road carsick jump suck next spot angel billabong break essentially walk distance shoe nice thong appropriate take shot head back point request go back port im do ready go home wait port hour next ferry notice people every minute seem many suspect absolutely jam pack ferry brim take 3 small boat ride ferry passenger board little boat verge sink due weight finally fast ferry stick back ferry stand 4 big propeller get soak giant wave whole way back fear safety way back top wade thigh high water scale dangerous rock wall top want people know get go unlike u properly prepare hopefully good experience u seem noones safety consider trip day age disappoint many people lifes put risk make money,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969,positive

Perfect white sand flecked with pieces of coral, a massive cavern on one side of the beach, and the T-Rex cliff on the other. The waves are big, strong, shore breakers and there is a fairly hefty rip current.

The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help.

Jun 2018,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here.

Nov 2018,"Stunning view from up top of the dinosaur rock. Can get really pretty views at sunset. That hike down. Oh wow, that was very very hard. It’s extremely slippery going down. I have size 14 feet which made it very difficult for me to find footing to place my feet. I hike quite often back home in Western Canada, so I felt pretty confident doing it until I slipped and fell and cut up my elbows. Then entire way down, shaking legs and thoughts of “oh god I’m going to die here.” I advice anyone doing this hike: if you struggled in the first half of the hike which is until the dinosaur’s back and then u turn towards the beach and start going down to do other half. TURN back! So can get some very pretty pictures from there because the second half down is soooo much worse and extremely steep with very tight spacing which makes it very tricky when ur going down and ppl are coming up. Some ppl were doing the hike bare feet to get better grip which might be an idea worth trying?!?Once you get down to the beach, it is pure paradise. Can’t swim in it but the massive waves are beautiful to see and there is a tiny stand down there serving drinks which is cool. Can’t believe they go up/down that hike every day with merchandise. Hike back up was fine for me because I have strong upper body and it requires lots of pulling yourself up holding onto support branches that are places along hike.

Oct 2017,"Worth the (rather rocky) journey to Kelingking Beach. Apparently it will take years before they can upgrade the gravel roads to tar ones. While it is possible to rent mopeds to get around simply anywhere in Nusa Penida, personally I won't recommend them!

And its is impossible if you are going with a half day private tour. Another beautiful spot is at the ""neck"" of the island. Taking photo from above is also a bit scary..

Members of our group weren't keen on walking all the way down to the beach but I did go some of the way down and deeply regret not going all the way. I think it is something extremely worthwhile and doesn't seem very treacherous to do.

Feb 2019,"Even though I went to Bali for scuba diving, I had to spend one day visiting the west part of Nusa Penida which I believe is more famous and appealing than the east part.My first stop was the Kelingking beach which I absolutely loved. Many people complained about the crowd, but if you visit it before 11AM like I did, you won't see a lot of people until you go back to the top.The view from the top is breathtaking, and you can fully admire the T-Rex shape that everyone talks about. However, there is more to it. If you take your courage in both hands, and make it all the way down to the beach, you will not regret it. Though be warned than it's rather tricky to reach to the beach, and I strongly recommend you to wear a good pair of shoes over sandals, but you will want to wear the latter once you reach the beach. A woman twisted her ankle on the way down, and I have absolutely no idea how she made it back to the top so please be careful if you wish to go to the beach.Once you are at the beach, simply enjoy. The waves crushing on the beach make it a very relaxing place, and the view is also quite amazing. That said, if you wish to swim, you might be disappointed as the currents are quite strong, and only experienced swimmers should enjoy.Again, if you want to fully enjoy this place, go early in the day. There were six or seven people on the beach when I went in the morning, but close to a hundred when I went back up early in the afternoon.Enjoy :)",even though go bali scuba dive spend one day visit west part nusa penida believe famous appeal east partmy first stop kelingking absolutely love many people complain crowd visit 11am wont see lot people go back topthe view top breathtaking fully admire trex shape everyone talk take courage hand make way will regret though warned rather tricky reach strongly recommend wear good pair shoe sandal will want wear latter reach woman twist ankle way absolutely idea make back top please careful wish go beachonce simply enjoy wave crush make relaxing place view quite amaze say wish swim might disappoint current quite strong experienced swimmer enjoyagain want fully enjoy place go early day six seven people go morning close hundred go back early afternoonenjoy,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.554, 'pos': 0.354, 'compound': 0.9906}",0.9906,positive

Dec 2017,"Arrived here via moped on the horrendous roads but worth every massive bump along the way. Spectacular views the rock formation, which looks like a dinosaurs head. The sea is clear blue, with white sands. There are various spots you can view it from and have your photo taken. On a personal note I suffer badly from a fear of heights so unlike most wasn't keen on getting too close to the edge due to the very steep drop. There are 'steps' made from bamboo and tree roots that lead down the steep ascent to the beach but there is a sign suggesting it is dangerous so not to go down. I certainly wouldn't attempt this in flipflops or if like me you have a fear of heights. I tried to go a short way down (after some encouragement) for a photo but couldn't make it as I was too worked up but many others found it fine to reach the photo point. I only saw 1-2 people who went all the way down to the beach. It looks amazing but not for the faint hearted by any means.There are a few shops and restaurants around at teh top which are nice to sit in and enjoy the view.
