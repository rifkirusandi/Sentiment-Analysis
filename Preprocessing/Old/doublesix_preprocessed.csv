Jun 2019,"A NEW NAME AND APPEARANCE FOR AN OLD SPOT….­I first visited in the early 80s – stayed here in 2015 – and checked it out annually since.A NEW NAME - this 500m section of the 9km KUTA to CANGGU beach strip has only been referred to as DOUBLE SIX BEACH these past few years.Prior, it was simply that section where LEGIAN BCH changes to SEMINYAK BCH – abt 3km from the KUTA end. Makes sense: the huge DOUBLE SIX RESORT was not opened until AUG. ‘14.A NEW APPEARANCE – I used to cycle KUTA-CANGGU beach in the 80s. Back then, the busy hotel strip would start to peter out in LEGIAN – by the time I got to the D6 area there was nothing much in back of the beach – just the occasional resort accessed by tracks down from JL LEGIAN inland. How things have changed – continuous resorts now extend past D6 to north of SEMINYAK.So D6 BEACH has changed, but what is it like? Well it’s one of the more popular stretches of sand along this busy strip - because of GOOD ACCESS (Jalan  Arjuna hits the beach here from inland LEGIAN/STH SEMINYAK which have dozens of resorts covering all budgets - and the FABULOUS BEACH CLUBS with their on-sand soft cushions and little tables mentioned in many other reviews. The place is certainly attractive, with lotsa sunlounges for rent and those multi-coloured umbrellas. South of the beach clubs are a host of those local guys selling beer – buy from them and you get the plastic chair and table, usually an umbrella and are their friend for life. They often rent sunlounges, surfboards etcMY RATING Normally I would rate D6 Beach ABOVE AVERAGE but for one demerit – the open drain that runs below JL ARJUNA exits across the beach: dry season sees just a trickle but wet season can be a torrent.TIPS – wet season is not the best time to visit the whole extended beach – lotsa rubbish and storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).- those beach clubs: at least 3 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw the northern-most with at least 1000 people on the sand! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value but too many people for me – I went back to the beer guys.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems mid-range to high end. Dozens of places covering all budgets within a 10 min stroll inland via JL ARJUNA.- JL ARJUNA and others similarly have dozens of restaurants from sub-budget up. Wandering food halwkers on the sand can provide some inexpensive yummy stuff as does the guy doing roasted corn foot of ARJUNA.- no shortage of RETAIL THERAPY on ARJUNA and along JL LEGIAN 800M inland (latter has some of BALI’s better boutiques and furniture/art)- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.SUM UP – definitely worth a visit but overall no better than half a dozen other locations along the long extended beach",new name appearance old spoti first visit early 80 stayed 2015 check annually sincea new name 500m section 9km kuta canggu strip refer double six past yearsprior simply section legian bch change seminyak bch abt 3km kuta end make sense huge double six resort open aug 14a new appearance use cycle kutacanggu 80 back busy hotel strip start peter legian time get d6 area nothing much back occasional resort access track jl legian inland thing change continuous resort now extend past d6 north seminyakso d6 change well one popular stretch sand along busy strip good access jalan arjuna hit inland legiansth seminyak dozen resort cover budget fabulous club onsand soft cushion little table mention many review place certainly attractive lotsa sunlounges rent multicoloured umbrellas south club host local guy sell beer buy plastic chair table usually umbrella friend life often rent sunlounges surfboard etcmy rating normally rate d6 average one demerit open drain run jl arjuna exit across dry season see trickle wet season torrenttips wet season best time visit whole extend lotsa rubbish storm runoff ocean onshore blustery wave create dangerous swim condition periodic stormdrains creeks gush across sand make lateral progress difficult many still holiday although sanur side island much nicer well shelter condition btw still plenty sunshine wet season usually club least 3 start d6 resort 2019s visit saw northernmost least 1000 people sand seem indonesian idul fitri holiday period indos holiday mode good value many people go back beer guy beachfront accommodation day seem midrange high end dozen place cover budget within 10 min stroll inland via jl arjuna jl arjuna others similarly dozens restaurant subbudget wander food halwkers sand provide inexpensive yummy stuff guy roast corn foot arjuna shortage retail therapy arjuna along jl legian 800m inland latter bali well boutique furnitureart football fan will usually find several game open section sand outsider welcomesum definitely worth visit overall well half dozen location along long extend,"{'neg': 0.021, 'neu': 0.783, 'pos': 0.197, 'compound': 0.9953}",0.9953,positive

Nov 2018,"The beach at double six is not a place to relax, although the sunset here is pretty. (Provided there are no clouds in the pm) but be prepared to be hassled by peddlers trying to sell you sarongs, watches, paintings, kites & jewellery. This might be acceptable if it were only a few of them, but the days I went to double six I was hassled every five minutes by so many of them it became very annoying. I hired a sun lounge, to relax but every few minutes a peddler came. They do not care for your peace & quiet. Even when you say no, the lady peddlers grab your feet and say “foot massage ?” Several times despite you declining. No personal boundaries. You have to be rude to get them to leave. So for 2 hours I hired a lounge and had no break from them. I don’t think they understand how many of them come at you. It’s too much !!! Even when you go to the beach cafes at double six they are allowed in the restaurant while your eating .....to hassle you to buy. Even when your about to take a mouthful of food they come right up. I was trying to be polite ,but it was just too much for me to enjoy my time there.  The food is very average, but the sunsets are lovely. The ocean isn’t always clean and some plastic and packaging floated past as I swam. There are many surf schools at double six beach but no designated area for them so wherever you swim be prepared for learner surfers to come crashing toward you. Ha ha . Better to go to less popular beaches. Or better still the islands are much nicer.

The bathroom with a tv attached right in front of the bath tub. The shower in both forms shower head and over head tropical fall. The staff so pleasant and ok its part of the job but it just felt more organic than forced. We were late to the pool a few mornings and worried about no sun lounges but the pool and lagoon staff always found room for us. This was a big plus for my new wife as she loves the sun. It would be a disservice to name individuals because every one made the stay so pleasant for us. We dine on the rooftop on day one and the view is something to behold, the view especially at sunset is magical. Plus the food was really good and reasonable compared to irish prices anyway. On our last night we visited the plantation grill bar in the hotel, we stepped in the elevator and stepped out in 1922 New York. It was like the old time Jazz Bars from New York movies. The ambiance, the food, the music, the conpany and the drinks were all top class 5 star rating. A little pricey but well worth the quality. I must mention ""Koma"" our waiter , smiling from ear to ear and when he heard it was our honeymoon well he brought out a plate with happy honeymoon and some specialist chocolates, classy touch.

Prices for the drinks were also reasonable and if you ordered if while lying on your sunbed via the boys who were serving it was tax free and no service charge payable.Cold Fresh Coconut were excellent and so was the local Bintang beer.

Jun 2017,"This is a nice wide open beach with minimal sunbeds, so no to overcrowdrd. There are a lot of sellers on the beach and you be repeatedly hassled by them to buy some of their rubbish or even worse allow them to massage your legs and feet. They can and do get annoyed if you don't support them by buying something.The sunbeds were $10 for 2 beds but this was dependant on how long you wanted it, what time of day and who the boy was selling the idea to you.

Aug 2016,"What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple. On this occasion, there are a few kids or all ages, but mostly coupes and small groups of men and women is their early 30's. It's quiet, classy and relaxed with EVERYTHING you could ever want at your fingertips.  10/10 for Double Six.

Oct 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable.",time manage stretch normal weekend best possible extent bali tripwe want go south bali last trip part asia serene mountainsvolcanic lake monkey forestsouth bali fabulous beach start seminyaklegian way south kutawe choose stay pearl hotel double six road hardly 10 minute walk distance happen place south baliwe take early flight friday afternoon reach eveninganthonywho owner pearl hotel make arrangement pick airportit take 30 min reach boutique hotel dump bags hotel room head double six beachthere plenty shack live music bean bag sand little colourful umbrellasthe sand beautiful set right local band playingwe enjoy good nacho satay along free flow drink music balinese jennifer lopeznight well spent retire hotelthis place quiet nice pool midst private room amenitiesafter breakfast saturday morning back strollingwalking past huge surf wave create misty environmentthere couch one rent 10 per hourwe treat double couch enjoy breeze facesbeautiful view amy tan save fish drowningwe lazy lay back lunch hotel oberoi trendy dj play delicious cocktail taste life relentless wave continue crush create beautiful rhythm sit sip refresh cocktail fresh thin crust wooden pizzathe even well spent watch beautiful sunset experiencedhopping cafesfloating paper lanterns watch fire dance beachwe explore laplancha sand timenow entire sunday spent per whim spent bit differently pamper authentic balinese massage follow lunch famous mehraputti happen street semninyak one cant resist shopping walk past best shopping boutiqueswatched breathtaking sunset hotel oberoi loungeone make advance book place becomes crowd sun set beach legian view cherish lifefinally head potato head poolside dinnerboth potato head mehraputti exquisite din experience one must south baliwe morning flight catch monday thus end plan one best backpacker tour indonesianot forget pearl arrange taxi right time wee hour even though reception close professionalism much appreciate make stay smooth memorable,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.9968}",0.9968,positive

Jul 2015,I recently stayed at a hotel close to the beach and went to the beach each day.The beach had swimming flags which a lot of swimmers swan between.The problem was that lots of surfers also kept moving into the area making it very unsafe for the swimmers due to the surf boards frequently nearly hitting the swimmers.After seeing many near misses I approached the surf life savers they said the current was pulling the surfers along the beach so there is nothing they could do. I pointed out that the flags are there for swimmer safety and the surfers should not be in the area under any circumstances and besides they had all of the rest of the beach to surf. The life savers answer was to remove the swimming flags and put up no swimming signs - not a satisfactory outcome.  For the rest of my stay (9 days) the flags were not put back out. It seems that the surfers have all the rights and to bad for swimmers.I love the Bali beaches its just a pity safety isn't taken a little more seriously but I suppose that's Bali for you.,recently stay hotel close go daythe swimming flag lot swimmer swan betweenthe problem lot surfer keep move area make unsafe swimmer due surf board frequently nearly hit swimmersafter see many near miss approach surf life saver say current pulling surfer along nothing point flag swimmer safety surfer area circumstance besides rest surf life saver answer remove swimming flag put swim sign satisfactory outcome rest stay 9 day flag put back seem surfer right bad swimmersi love bali beach pity safety isnt take little seriously suppose thats bali,"{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.5575}",0.5575,positive

One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable.",time manage stretch normal weekend best possible extent bali tripwe want go south bali last trip part asia serene mountainsvolcanic lake monkey forestsouth bali fabulous beach start seminyaklegian way south kutawe choose stay pearl hotel double six road hardly 10 minute walk distance happen place south baliwe take early flight friday afternoon reach eveninganthonywho owner pearl hotel make arrangement pick airportit take 30 min reach boutique hotel dump bags hotel room head double six beachthere plenty shack live music bean bag sand little colourful umbrellasthe sand beautiful set right local band playingwe enjoy good nacho satay along free flow drink music balinese jennifer lopeznight well spent retire hotelthis place quiet nice pool midst private room amenitiesafter breakfast saturday morning back strollingwalking past huge surf wave create misty environmentthere couch one rent 10 per hourwe treat double couch enjoy breeze facesbeautiful view amy tan save fish drowningwe lazy lay back lunch hotel oberoi trendy dj play delicious cocktail taste life relentless wave continue crush create beautiful rhythm sit sip refresh cocktail fresh thin crust wooden pizzathe even well spent watch beautiful sunset experiencedhopping cafesfloating paper lanterns watch fire dance beachwe explore laplancha sand timenow entire sunday spent per whim spent bit differently pamper authentic balinese massage follow lunch famous mehraputti happen street semninyak one cant resist shopping walk past best shopping boutiqueswatched breathtaking sunset hotel oberoi loungeone make advance book place becomes crowd sun set beach legian view cherish lifefinally head potato head poolside dinnerboth potato head mehraputti exquisite din experience one must south baliwe morning flight catch monday thus end plan one best backpacker tour indonesianot forget pearl arrange taxi right time wee hour even though reception close professionalism much appreciate make stay smooth memorable,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.9968}",0.9968,positive

Mar 2015,"I quite liked Double Six Beach. It was a bit grubby with a bit of litter around etc but still a nice place to hang out, particularly at night. I hired an umbrella lounge for $5 and was soon approached by one of the many massage ladies who sell along the beach. They sell bracelets, sarongs, do manicures, massages, you name it, they do it. I had a great massage by a lovely older lady. She was very nice and it was a good massage. I paid about $13 Australian i guess which is probably more than the going rate for a beach massage, but i thought she was worth it. Bit annoying to have other ladies come and try to sell you things when you clearly have your eyes closed in the middle of a massage, i just tried to ignore them without being rude. Often they would go and get a little child to come back with them to see if that improved their sales tactics. If there was something i wanted to buy i would not have minded but how many sarongs and bracelets can you buy in bali??? This beach cafes etc were not really open during the lead up to Nyepi Day so we only got to go down there our last night. La Plancha was very popular with all the umbrellas and bean bags on the beach. We decided to go to the little place one up from them, i think it was called the Juice Park or something like that. Bean bags, not as busy and cheap drinks, we were very happy to hang out there and would certainly go back. Much quieter than La Plancha and we even had a foot massage on the bean bags, how cool is that. We stayed at the gorgeous Double Six Resort but next time would not waste my time drinking at their rooftop bar or their expensive pool area. At $16 for a very average cocktail i would rather drink cheap drinks on a bean bag on the beach any time. Especially with someone massaging my feet! Doesnt get any better than that in Bali!

If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourist come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are pristine paradise.p so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc.  I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer.  This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built  over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person.  All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left.

Mar 2013,"Legian Beach, where Double Six Beach is, is actually a middle point between Kuta Beach and Seminyak Beach.  Double Six is just near the edge of Legian and start of Seminyak.In terms of crowd, you can see less of a crowd here than Kuta Beach, although you can still see lots of umbrella lounges for you to sit and enjoy the beach.  There are quite a number of surf schools here, so you can see some beginners trying to learn to surf.  This area is definitely not for swimming as the waves are strong.  But it's a nice place to stroll around the beach and hear the waves.There are some warungs around the area too, where you can get some food.  And there are a couple of bars just off the street parallel to the beach, if you dig the night life.You can see locals selling their wares, but they are not pushy as I've read about.  They sell jewelries, watches, kites.  The kites were actually quite nice and intricate, I saw one they were flying which was a pirate ship with many sails.  Actually I was just walking along, they offered 200,000 at first then even without any reaction from me except a smile, they lowered it to 100,000.  I figured I could get it for 50,000 if I haggled, haha!  But I didn't intend to buy it since it was too difficult to bring home anyway.The sand is ok, but it's brown.  There are also some garbage along the beach, plus patches of them along the sides, which is really a waste of the beauty of the beach.  I don't mind the brown/black sand as long as the beach is clean.  My friend told me Kuta Beach is even worse.In the evening, you can see a lot of local folks who have come to enjoy the beach.I was excited to see the sunset, unfortunately, it was raining that day, so I missed it.
