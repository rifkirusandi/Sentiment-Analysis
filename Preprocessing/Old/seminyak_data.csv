MADHURKJAIN,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2019,Pristine white sandy beach. Ideal place to relax or swim. Located in the vicinity of a chain of high end hotels. Amazing sunset views
ind,"England, UK",Sep 2019,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha."
PrestonGuild,United Kingdom,Jul 2019,"Once you go past Legian beach you are on Seminyak Beach.There are also some high end hotels on the vicinity and I noted that it was less busier here.A nice place to have a stroll, popular with surfers and it was relatively clean."
Aslam_Sherif,"London, UK",Aug 2019,Seminyak beach is nice and clean. I found it some parts is is very busy and loud and other parts it is very quiet.I had an ocean view room at the hotel I was staying and the view was very relaxing.
Sandy Ta,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"Purposely chose Seminyak beach of all places in Bali for my trip as I wanted to learn surfing (first timer) and heard the food/drinks options are great. It was the right decisions. The beach was beautiful, lively but not so crowded. Many drink stalls along the main stretch of the beach (near La Plancha) which also rented out beach chairs for you to sit down and the staff were always ready to tell a tales or two to entertain you. The surfing booths were everywhere but not all of them are reputable so do your research before hand. Swimming is possible but try to void those places with warning flag and those with a lot of surfers."
Mansi Reddy,"Chennai (Madras), India",Oct 2019,"We stayed at the W Bali and had easy access to the beach. We absolutely loved this beach, lots of lovely beach bars with very comfortable loungers, amazing sunsets and a fabulous party vibe at night."
Aloysius170,"Sumba, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"I have been living in Seminyak village for 10 years in 1976, Although I love walking on the beach I heard many time people drawned here because the undercurrent is very strong. It is a black sand beach and when clear it is great for sunset photoes"
Flare,"Helsinki, Finland",Mar 2019,"Dissapointment after Nusa Dua quiet beaches. This beach was a party beach, noicy, grouded and parties all night long."
BA2727,"Guildford, UK",Dec 2019,"Flat busy beach, dark dirty sand.  Just didnt like it.  Water cleanliness quality is meant to be an issue to."
Rie06,"Chicago, IL",Aug 2019,"Very nice beach. I went in the late afternoon, and it wasn’t very crowded. The beach is very clean, and the water was clear. Nice, relaxing experience. Know that you pay to use the loungers, and there are people selling things like sunglasses and bracelets."
vanessasmith75,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,"Love staying at the beach for just relaxing or chit chat with family and friends. Beside double six area, sometimes i go to seminyak beach to spend time with family or friends. Not really clean beach but is ok. "
2TravellingGeordies,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Dec 2019,Stayed in Seminyak for 5 days. Visited the beach three times and very disappointed with the amount of plastics on the beach..never been anywhere and seen such an amount of plastics from high to low water. Tourists actually walking along picking up all the debris. There are tractors on the beach raking the sand but not picking up and debris. Find it hard to believe that the tourist board/government allow tourists to swim and paddle  amongst this filth. The amount tourism brings to Bali then take some of your tourists money and pay local people to pick up the rubbish... the amount of rubbish on the beach depends upon rainfall flooding the rivers and taking it down to settle on the beaches. Anyone going in the sea comes face to face with the rubbish pity help any other unseen nasties are in the water...... expect a tourism tax to be incurred if action taken to clean up.
Akshat G,273 contributions,Dec 2019,Supposed to be one of the best beaches in Bali - this beach let us down a bit. Water was rough and beach wasn’t very scenic 
Craig C,"Ashford, UK",Dec 2019,"Not the best beach however well used by tourist and locals, they are making an effort to clean it daily but could be better... many activities available for people to try..."
CopperBeauty,30 contributions,Dec 2019,"The beach wasn’t too crowded, considering the large volume of people in the area for the new year celebration. Lots of space to spread out with a beach chair and enjoy the gorgeous water and a fancy cocktail."
Catherine Liew,40 contributions,Dec 2019,Went for a walk at the beach to catch the sunset. Don't expect a white sandy beach. It is black sand here. Dissapointed with how dirty the beach was with lots of plastic floating around. 
Stephen C,"1,055 contributions",Dec 2019,Came here to watch the sunset. Camped ourselves at the Potato Head and strolled onto the beach to catch the beautiful endless rolling waves.The volcanic ash sand is very good on the eyes and nice to tread on. The beach was also very clean. The wide open sea was therefore very inviting and it is hard to see why so many enjoy taking a dip in the waters here.Personally I find the beach here to be nicer than the ones in Nusa Day.
P S,"Tulum, Mexico",Nov 2019,There was litter everywhere and hardly any restaurants that were open. Overall not the best beach that we visited during our visit.
Jaya K,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2019,Our visits to Seminyak beach was good. Pleasant and clean beach. It was extremely hot at the time we visited.  
William A,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2019,Great beach to walk and find a cool bar and restuarant. Local shops along the beach with small vendors. Can rent body boards or surfboards all over. Waves are decent and water is nice and warm. Rent a chair on the beach and relax along side the kids selling bracelets to you.
Sara Alure,5 contributions,Dec 2019,better than Canggu. nicer friendly vibes. many nice places around good food good yoga good massage and good accommodations around here 
DJM,9 contributions,Aug 2019,"Seminyak beach is always a fun place to stroll along with friends and family during june to october. We could experience The sun but at the same time the cool breeze from the winter in Australia will blow to the whole of bali, making the weather perfect!! You would also see people run and walk with their dogs. Others would just enjoy the sound of wave with a glass of wine or beer or wiskey. Amazing."
Ross G,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2019,"beers on the beach under a beachbar umbrella, watching the surfers and beach walkers.experiencing the magical sunset.beautiful experiences"
smithtan,12 contributions,Dec 2019,"It's superb with beautiful sunset, it's magical black sand beach. Recommended to you once you visit seminyak bali."
Haileymarit,"Kodiak Island, AK",Dec 2019,"The beach was okay. Stays shallow for awhile but has a big break , so not good for swimming. It was also very dirty in the water and beach. Farther up “north” of Seminyak beach google pin is the only section we saw that wasn’t dirty or littered. Farther down towards Kuta was so cluttered with litter it wasn’t even enjoyable to walk on the beach. Also a pretty windy beach. Definitely not a picture perfect “Bali” beach , but enjoyable and you can have a great beach day if you make the most of it. "
Tris,5 contributions,Dec 2019,"Stay in seminyak, don't forget to visit this beautiful beach with alot entertains in surrounding. Best recommended beach in Bali"
René de Beer,5 contributions,Dec 2019,We loved this beach.. Best for body surfing. 6-8 foot waves so not for little kids.. The water was refreshing. The best sunset every evening.
Angelo G,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,The beach was not that packed however it is sad to see the amount of plastic pollution on the shore.  The seating area is adorned with faded Air Asia beach umbrellas and the odd dog or two.  More reason to be careful about where you step.  
Bryan O,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2019,"Seminyak is a niece clean beach, with some good ammenities. You can rent sun beds which are very comfortable all be it a little pricey at AU$10 each but if you were to stay for a day , it’s good value. The water is good but a fair bit of plastic debris. Watch out getting taxis from here as they try and extract as much as they can. Either insist on the meter or barter the price beforehand."
WorldTravellerOz,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,This is not the cleanest beach in the world but it has an appeal especially at sunset.Lovely walk along the beach here.
Suzenne,14 contributions,Dec 2019,Took a short stroll from our hotel at Courtyard by Marriott Seminyak to catch the beautiful sunset. We didn’t manage to catch the sunrise or chill in the afternoon there but overall is Nice beach with fine sand. 
4Boys,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2019,Love this spot. Great for a night relaxing on the beach laying on a bean bag with music and food readily available 
Jackiefm,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2019,Nothing is better then hiring a sunbed for the day ($5) and taking in the sun and surf. Of course people watching is at its prime!!
Stephen B,"Manchester, UK",Dec 2019,"Beautiful beech with lots of bars, the prices for places to eat and drink were about normal for most places in Bali so no opportunity to snag a deal but none the less well worth going "
kkulasingamk,7 contributions,Dec 2019,Nice wide beach. Can hire deck chairs to sunbathe. Soft drinks & beers may be ordered and served at your chair. Rolling waves. Great for surfing beginners. Clean & cool seawater. Very invigorating.
lily w,Singapore,Dec 2019,"Sunset in Bali is beautiful, sunset view from Seminyak beach is breathtaking! It is one of the must go and see places every time I have a visitor in town, it’s a signature snapshot of the amazing Bali!"
Kristin S.,"Silverthorne, CO",Nov 2019,Fun to watch turtle release in the morning on the beach!!  We enjoyed renting beach chairs fronting the ocean watching the surf lessons and ability to walk up to grab a water or a cocktail!
Clare S,"Coventry, UK",Nov 2019,A variety of eating places with a mix of street food and table service. The beach is clean and the sea clear.Hot during the day but plenty of beds and umbrellas to hire. 
Davy Boy,4 contributions,Nov 2019,"Shopping in Seminyak I was sweating majorly , wandered down to Seminyak beach and wow how refreshing.  Clean water, nice size surf. The best."
Susan B,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2019,"We spent a few afternoons and evenings down at the beach.  We sat in the beanbags on the beach, ordered some beers and watched amazing sunsets.  We live in Perth and see the sun setting over the ocean often, but this was different.  It was just beautiful.The beach had a great vibe. Loved it."
AndyTen,Germany,Nov 2019,"The beach for me is close to perfect when it comes for a beach vacation.The water is cleaner than at other spots few hundred meters North or South. Good for swimming (look for the red/yellow flags) and surfing.However do not expect paradise beach, higher waves mean water not so clear and water not Caribbean azure.In the evenings there are plenty of beach bars where you can sit with feet in the sand watching the ocean - for every budget you will find something that suits your pocket, style and taste."
Marc W,"Austin, TX",Nov 2019,"We were staying close so hot this beach several times. Nice sand, plenty of chairs and a great sunset. The guys that rented our chairs also had cheap beer, bonus. The water itself was nothing spectacular, big waves so no real swimming just wading. Surfing if your into it.lots of restaurants along the beach too."
Flaves73,"Bendigo, Australia",Nov 2019,"Seminyak beach is the best place to experience a breath taking Bali sunset. The beach comes to life as the sun goes down with live music, bars and seating."
Jignakp,"London, UK",Nov 2019,"Lovely clear water. Very busy beach, so best to go early in the morning,  the water is not too cold. Very popular surfing location to. This beach is not rocky like dreamland beach further south"
fredamy65,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019,Plenty of space with minimal to nil hawkersRecommend if you are learning to surf. Predictable waves and not too big
Andrew O,"San Remo, Australia",Nov 2019,"Went to the beach club to have a couple of drinks to watch an amazing sunset , need to spend $50 Australian to have a day bed which is basically 4 mixed drinks Definitely a must to experience "
Rachael Colette,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"My husband and I strolled along the beach from 4.45pm till sunset at about 6pm. It was amazing! However, we noticed that dirty water flowed into the sea at certain parts along the beach. Although it is only natural, seeing and smelling it turned us off and we did not want to play in the water. Be vigilant to watch where you are walking as well because we found broken beer bottles shards in the sand. Overall, it was a beautiful beach and watching cute dogs run around the beach was a bonus. "
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2019,"Coming here my whole life, it’s a great beach and it’s clean. Lots of hotels etc around aswel as beach bars and little warungs. Great for all and also for having a walk with your dog ."
Empressb,3 contributions,Nov 2019,Lovely friendly beach with lots of colourful beanbags in my opinion its more of a evening beach hangout
Paul M,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2019,End the day watching the sun drop into the ocean. Sip on a cocktail spread out on the beanbags. Must do on your Bali itinerary.
Dave s,"Deal, United Kingdom",Nov 2019,"Quiet beach superb for surfing and lazing around,spectacular sunsets and great bars and music.sunbeds a must as its hot!"
Agnes Perez,"Manila, Philippines",Nov 2019,Most stylish and upscale beach resort! We enjoyed the vies and the water! We will come back for sure!
iamkayoh,472 contributions,Nov 2019,Beach is pretty clean except for occasional bits of drink bottles left on the beach. Nice place to sunbathe with a ice cold Bintang or coconut! Beware of stalls charging overpriced drinks though. Check the price before ordering and sitting down at the beach chairs. One of them charged me IDR200K for a coconut!Do look out!
gypsygirl52,"Busselton, Australia",Nov 2019,Staying in Seminyak only 3 Nights so.plenty to see and do.We did manage to get to see the Beach a shirt walk from  Seminyak Square.We did not hire Sun beds could have got them for 7000 each with a little bartering. The Beach was clean not much Surf that day.Lots of places to grab a bite to eat and a lovely place to watch the Sun Set.
Meg,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2019,"The beach had soft sand and lots of beach chairs. There are heaps of restaurants, bars and surf schools along the beach here. The sand gets very hot in the sun, so we went at 8am to swim before it gets unbearable. Lots of street dogs, but they mostly leave you alone.Beautiful sunsets after 6pm, reccomend arriving around 5:30pm to take it all in."
Mark B,"Mosman, Australia",Nov 2019,"I visited Seminyak Beach because it was close to our Villa - but what a horrible beach. Black sand, dogs defecating and urinating everywhere. Rubbish blowing all over the place. I wouldn't go back."
Sanku,"Waidhan, India",Nov 2019,Beautiful beach. One of the Best Sunset View point. Clean beach & Good place to dive in. Lots of beach side Cafe & Pubs are there. These are one of the best Beach Clubs of Bali. Must visit place. 
Darlene K,"Colorado Springs, CO",Nov 2019,"Many beachfront restaurants to choose from  to enjoy watching the beautiful sunset while you eat dinner. It is popular, so you will be in the company of many who are in celebratory moods. In contrast, early morning walks on this same beach are quiet and peaceful."
Elyze,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2019,"We are here to watch the sunset. A lot of restaurants by the beach and a lot of locals trying to sell you things. Nevertheless, it is still a good place to chill and have a long romantic walk with your loved ones."
Palesa,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2019,"Loved it. Absolutely... little to no waves, I’m happy with the small restaurant there, great service and very friendly"
stephanie C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2019,"We ended up having an evening stroll along the beach around sunset which we thorougly enjoyed.Had we wanted an evening meal,there were numerous well patronised  restaurants from which we could have chosen. The beach was clean and others like us, both locals and tourists were taking advantage of using this lovely spot for recreational purposes."
Max H,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Nov 2019,"Reality sinks in on this beach. Plastic, garbage,netting, fisherman's wires and litter everywhere. Dead fish line the beach as well. Very sad to see. Sand is very dark so water seems very dark- barely able to see my feet while swimming next to ramen noodle packets. Sunset is lovely, as it is worldwide. Nice to see the million yoga poses and selfies being made next to the litter. "
Emma W,8 contributions,Nov 2019,Great beach with sun beds these cost approx 100 rupees to hire for as long as you want.   Water is warm but quite rough to swim in.  But an ideal place to spend the day being lazy.   Also ideal place to watch the famous sunsets
Dan A,"Donnybrook, Australia",Nov 2019,"A wonderful place to sit back relax and watch the sun set while listening to great live music.Jus sit back in your bean bag, enjoy a drink, meal or even a massage. Fantastic spot."
MPAINTAL,"Panjim, India",Nov 2019,Beautiful beach clean and lovely water. Nice ambience...then just like all Bali beaches well maintained and managed and peaceful.  
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Nov 2019,"Seminyak Beach is relatively quiet during the day. It's cool, sunny and breezy ambience provides a great place for hanging out, sunbathing and swimming. Surfing is allowed in certain areas of the beach. There are plenty of restaurants/bars nearby so you can relax, have a drink and meals while enjoying people watching or the sunset. "
lucasi1911,19 contributions,Nov 2019,"The only nice thing about this beach is the sunset. Full of rubbish and plastic bottles. In the evening all the beach clubs put on the beach a lot of bean bags, all broken. You can see a million pieces of polystyrene beads flying around and so many cigarettes butts. It’s really sad as they all end up in the sea..."
Matt B G,"Auckland, New Zealand",Nov 2019,"Great beach at sunset, or any time of the day. There is some litter but they are trying to sort the issue. The biggest issue for us was the shear quantity of hawkers. At one stage whilst trying to see the sunset we had 3 bothering us and whilst they aren't threatening they are persistent.There were signs warning about rips so we didn't swim but it isn't really a swimming beach as there are big waves."
CCarlos75,"Sacramento, CA",Oct 2019,My Villa was a 5 minute walk from Seminyak Beach and I enjoyed jogging early in the morning during sunrise...when the temperature was perfect and beach wasn't crowded. Very clean beach
Regina M,53 contributions,Nov 2019,"Wake up at 5am and walk by Seminyak beach was my ritual during vacation. It was beautiful, only 2/3 people showed up during that time. As the sun goes up, people started showing up for jogging, walking the dog or just hanging out enjoying the beach."
Michael v,"Redland City, Australia",Oct 2019,Beautiful spot to enjoy the sunset on a beanbag with a bevy and some nibblies. Just don’t use the beach toilet you have to pay to use. Disgusting.
pmickey,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2019,"The beach is very clean , we where here in oct November the flags most days where red and yellow, good to play in the water near shore line , or surf , but not great for swimming, could have been this time of year, but it was really nice sand , and clean and not many vendors asking you to buy something, "
N2N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2019,We just took a walk along the beach and enjoyed the sunset. Definitely great beach to visiting whilst in Seminyak.
Pedro L,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Oct 2019,"Expensive umbrella/chair rentals and signs say swimming is prohibited, although people ignored that restriction.  Still, it was nice scenery."
Tracey R,31 contributions,Oct 2019,beach was beautiful nice breeze from see all day clean and tidy. only pitiful is the the people who sell on the beach dont listen when you tell them no. other than that beautiful clean beach
nonina70,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Nov 2019,You can enjoy by staying at places that have condition minimum order start from 100k..the difference only the place higher because they give more exclusive place
colleen t,"Winchelsea, Australia",Oct 2019,Last time I was in Seminyak was four years ago and I can’t believe the change in the condition of the beach.Clean and uncluttered!!!Great work to all
John C,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"Great beach, great sun beds  Some surf schools and beach side massage During the day it is quite as the sun sets the place gets busy with some music But the Sunset is spectacular "
Stan S,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,Came here to see the sun set. Beautiful white sandy beach with clear waters. Lovely view of sun-set. There is a swing with the words Petitenget ideal for Instagram. No drinks stalls or cushions littering the beach like Kuta. Less commercialized. One word - beautiful.
jane s,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2019,Nothing better than spending a sunset at the beach. Grab a beanbag a cocktail menu and your in for a great time with friends 
Rodney J,"Neutral Bay, Australia",Oct 2019,"Just beautiful, better than I could of imgined. A great way to walk from the many resorts and beachfront restaurants."
Pathfinder221035,2 contributions,Oct 2019,"Not many beach bed options, but it was quiet when we were there. The current is strong and would not be suitable for young children."
G & H Travel,"Essex, UK",Oct 2019,"The beach itself is okay, the sunbeds are really comfy and you can get two sunbeds for 3 hours for 150k. There are a few nice restaurants. The sunset is amazing though and this is why you come here. It is however quite touristy and the sea is quite rough so be careful."
Anne T,3 contributions,Oct 2019,This beach is not the golden sand with palm trees I was expecting. The sand is fine but the sea is dangerous. The waves and current are deceiving. There are red flags saying do not swim between and the life guards are constantly blowing their whistles to get you out of the water. The waves are  reminiscent of the Posiden Adventure!!!!
PhoenixT,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Oct 2019,"The beach is not ideal for swimming and current is strong and waves can be high plus I believe is not very clean either. But great for sunsets and the atmosphere at that time is so good with bars and beach huts are filled with people and singers, highly recommended for this experience."
Wayne,3 contributions,Oct 2019,Awesome beach. Great to see the beach is swept of litter each morningWould recommend too all. Night music/entertainment and plenty of bean bags to lounge on.
Lorie R,20 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing, vast beach.  Great for a walk, at times the surf is quite high.  Have to get used to the ladies and gentlemen peddling their wares on the beach. "
Lata P,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2019,The beach is crowded but nothing like seeing the sun set in the ocean. Yes of course you will have better choices to see the beach at Gili islands or in uluwatu. But the beach wasn't dirty just crowded.
Frank M,"Glasgow, UK",Oct 2019,The most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen. Sit and relax with a cold drink. It’s awesome you can hire a decked seat or just layOn the beach. Lots of surfers to watch.
Prof. Andrew John y Fernandes,"Valenzuela, Philippines",Oct 2019,"The usual Asian beach with grey sand, warm waters and features a longer sand base. Sadly, quite dirty"
danielle166,"Medan, Indonesia",Aug 2019,It's must to watch sunset here.Sandy beach with whole lot crowd but it's still has its own beauty. Go around 5 p.m. you should go earlier though to avoid traffic jam.You'll see one of the most amazing sunset here.
Jacqui S,"London, UK",Oct 2019,"This is an absolutely beautiful beach to go to and see an amazing sunset, one of the best yet , we even sent friends there and they had the same experience as us, and you also have to try the roast corn on the cob on the beach. Wow"
Barrie Rogers,59 contributions,Sep 2019,"Great place to sit back in a bean chair, take in the sunset and enjoy a cold beverage at the end of the day"
EucalyptDrive,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,"We wanted experience the amazing sunset along the beach, we were not disappointed.People all over the place enjoying the sunset, bring a camera as the shots are amazing. "
David V,"Baton Rouge, LA",Oct 2019,"We just took a walk along the beach.  Was a very gradual slope to the water.  Pretty big waves, surfers there. Chairs and umbrellas to sit on."
cantleyblade,Doncaster,Oct 2019,"Lengthy, clean, plenty of sun beds, umbrellas, beanbags, drinks facilities, surfing facilities.Waves can be very strong, so beware. Invariably breezy, so perfect to get a great tan."

Gary B,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,Lovely Seminyak beach with lots of great bars / restaurants to choose from.Within walking distance of Seminyak Square.
RayMads,"South Morang, Australia",Oct 2019,We visited the beach the afternoon of our departure back home. It was nice to just wander and soak in the beauty
James,"Kuta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,Locals so happy and helpful felt very safe for the cost of little money for a cool coconut drink and a Bintang we got to sit in the shade and watch the beach life and shopping close by for bargains ..... so good recommend ..... lots of private cars and taxes to get you back to your accommodation 
Chris G,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2019,One of the nicest beaches you will ever walk upon and the sunset is beautiful to watch from here. Definitely a beach worth visiting whilst in Bali.
sasidar30,"Coimbatore, India",Oct 2019,I guess it’s the most busiest beaches in Bali... I see a lot of local connect like the Sanur and unlike the nusa dua beach..It’s pretty hot in October.. so you have to carry what ever is necessary 
Rod W,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"The reality is that it is extremely hotThere's no white sand, it's grey gravel and no real surf.Hence no one is there.Plus the rubbish, everywhere "
Geordie K,"Cavite City, Philippines",Oct 2019,The beach is very popular and a great place to watch the sunset. Lots of surfing going on and you must stay within the flags to avoid the rip currents but it is very safe and plenty of food and drinking available all along the beach 
Gus Dark,Indonesia,Aug 2019,"Geez, they should build big parking building, a Multistorey car park on the empty land near the beach otherwise sooner or later people will come with bad atmosphere, which make the awesome sunset beach fullfilled with negative atmosphere caused by bad traffic around the area. Stop build Hotels or beach clubs here, all stackholders in this areas should re-think again about where Seminyak going in the near future."
Amit Agarwal,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2019,"This is the best I found in Bali, have many restaurants with shisha / Liquor and lovely food.One should try it"
luxurytraveller1964,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,The beach was clean and safe.  Lots of tourists and a wonderful way to enjoy the Bali culture.  Not too many locals looking to sell their wares makes this a relaxing location and perfect for watch the sun set each evening.
ozsarah,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2019,Fantastic beach and a great place to watch the surfers. Great beach lounges so you don’t have to be on the sand. 
Graham Dinwoodie,"Glasgow, UK",Sep 2019,Stunning beach very clean not to busy plenty to do from surfing to scuba diving and just having a beer and watching what has got to be the most romantic sunset to watch with your wife 
Eka A,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"This part of the beach is flat and long beach. You can do pretty much many activities, surf, soccer, swimming in the ocean, ride, kite flying, etc, etcBefore Sunset, many hotels and restaurants will put a bean bag along the beach and pumping with music. Love it Love it"
Dharmadji5,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"Could not sleep so I decide to take an early walk and catch a sunrise. To my wonderful surprise how fresh air and sandy beach while waiting for sunrise can be rejuvenated myself! There weren’t many people, but jogger and Jetleg tourist w their selfie mode were a few. Walked for an hour and finally watched the sun cracking the horizon to begin the new day. It’s plain beautiful thing to start your day in Bali. Perfecto"
Diane K,4 contributions,Oct 2019,Went for the sunset and it did not disappoint! You can grab a bean bag and a drink while you are there too. 
Shanster,"Auckland, New Zealand",Oct 2019,"Wonderful way to spend the day. We had a separate part of the beach due to the Marriott so no crowding, friendly attendant. Free water, lounges, towels, and wifi. Top notch."
MoreChill132,5 contributions,Sep 2019,"Big beach, full of people and buzzing atmosphere. Not gonna lie the sand looked a bit dirty and almost looked like a black sand beach."
al22tecc,Philippines,Aug 2019,"Very long and very wide beach, we strolled along the shoreline and eventually found ourselves where a lot of beach bean bags were placed in front of several restaurant/bars, for the purpose of watching the sunset.  It was very very crowded, and it will take some patience to get an available space.We eventually stayed and ordered dinner which was right after the sunset and it was still a relaxing moment.  After an hour or so, we slowly walked back to our villa hotel somewhere in Seminyak."
"Armando M. frm: Manila, Phil's.","Manila, Philippines",Oct 2019,I can say is this beach is typical Balinese beach. All beaches are similar and good for swimming. A place good for family. 
NZNicky,"Matamata, New Zealand",Sep 2019,"We are staying at the Furamaxclusive right on the beach at Seminyak & today my daughter & myself went for a swim at the beach & both of us were surprised how clean & clear the water was.. in fact my daughter said that’s the best beach she has ever swam at ( & there are some awesome beaches in NZ)!!Everyone on the beach is so friendly .. yes the hawkers do bother you but that’s all part of the Bali fun!!Sunset time is just the best!! You can hire sun loungers or bean bags to sit , relax drink a few cold Bintangs & just enjoy a spectacular sunset. This time has made up a very special part of our holiday. This beach is awesome!!"
Lou P,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,you cannot swim here as the sewer outlets are all nearby. also the shape of the bay does not allow the pollution in the water to disperse into the ocean. this is a swim at your very own risk.
Yanis L,3 contributions,Sep 2019,"Very popular beach, full of bars and restaurants, very lively, and not too tacky even if it is far from being an exclusive and stylish place."
Martyn J,"London, UK",Sep 2019,"Very long beach can walk for hours if you are feeling fit. Fine sand all the way.Beds are 100k IDR (£6), and bed guys also sell ife cold beers and waters 10k.Yes you get the locals trying to sell you bits and pieces but they never hassle. Just walk away as soon as you say no thank you.With this in mind it's one of the safest beaches I've sunbathe on. We walked for an hour and left our bags, also went for lunch and nothing was touched. Even felt comfortable leaving the misses while I popped back to the hotel. The waves are stunning, especially at high tide. No rocks in the water just lush sand. This beach made our holiday."
Taylor Breaux (Mrs.),"Eugene, OR",Sep 2019,Beautiful beach that is surrounded with pleasant restaurants and nice shopping nearby at Seminyak Square. 
Lesha G,"Durban, South Africa",Sep 2019,Beautiful shoreline. Amazing sunset. You do not have to drive all the way to Jimbaran for a stunning sunset. 
Александр Ф,"Moscow, Russia",Sep 2019,"TL;DR: Hands down the best beach in Bali.Okay, the situation is a bit silly. We came to the Seminyak from the airport at night, didn’t like the traffic and decided to see all the best beaches first before deciding where to live.So the next day at the early morning we started to explore them (not seeing Seminyak beach first!).Canggu, Munggu, Jimbaran, Dreamland, Melasti, Padang-Padang, Sanur (and some other places along the way) - whole day drive.Came back frustrated at night, no amazing beaches, if you were in Philippines, Thailand, Goa etc you understand, Bali beaches are average at best. Yeah, Melasti wedding pictures are nice, but it’s not for swimming, living and relaxing.Next day we saw Seminyak beach 100m from our hotel (right at the Ku De Ta).Ocean waves, tender and smooth light yellow sand, wide and bright beach kilometers long.It’s perfect.Seminyak is the most expensive place for a reason."
Siska B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,If you can learn to say no to the people selling you things while you lay on your subbed you paid $10 for with umbrella for the whole day you will love the beach in seminyak. Restaurants near buy who will deliver to your  day bed ! In all t yhe photos o had seen thought it would be a dirty beach but was lovely even the water was amazing. 
Irena N,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"We stayed at the Anantara hotel. It was fabulous - for service, pools, Buffet breakfast dinner experiences rooftop bar and restaurant. The staff could not have been more helpful or polite or just genuinely friendly and concerned for our enjoyment. "
Asenster,"Burgas, Bulgaria",Sep 2019,"It is very nice wide beach. It is perfect to drink cocktails, watch sunsets, listening live music, sunbathing, eat!"
Farkwad,"Agnes Water, Australia",Sep 2019,Awesome western sunsets into the Water with well priced beers sun beds and restaurants. Great swimming and fun for the whole family. 
Benholhar,"Penarth, UK",Sep 2019,Lovely setting to watch sunset on beach with a cocktail or two. Plenty of choice for drinks and views gets busy around 5pm so find a seat early 
Nick9289,"Castle Donington, UK",Sep 2019,Great time to walk on the beach just before sunset. It is very clean with very nice views to look at. 
Arun714,"Hokkaido, Japan",Sep 2019,"Great beach for sunsets, walks, kiteflying, playing in the sand relaxing on deckchairs and learning how to surf. Not good for swimming."
Louise P,"Cabarita Beach, Australia",Sep 2019,We loved Seminyak Beach! It’s clean and the water is beautiful. It’s busy at sunset everyday but there’s plenty of room to spread out and countless beach clubs to sit and watch the sunset from. It’s way better than the pictures you see on the internet. Seminyak is a great place in Bali to visit ❣️
KGinBris,"Ipswich, Australia",Sep 2019,"Awesome, affordable. You will soon get over the hawkers. Kick back, fall on a bean bag, apply some sunscreen, get yourself a lemon beer, laugh and talk and eat and drink and watch the sunset. You will only be slightly poorer but also a hell of a lot richer. Trust me."
Dennis P,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,The beach is very long  with good waves adequate for both swimmers and surfing.Small sections  are patrolled and while we were there large areas were closed to swimmers due to dangerous ripsSand near edges rather on the heavy and on the slightly dirty side. Sun lounges etc available for hire at reasonable prices. Without these there is little or no shade
MrOyvind,"Newport, Australia",Sep 2019,"This is a tough one.  The black volcanic sand and crashing waves on a beach fronted by fancy beach clubs and posh hotels make you think this is one of those wow exotic beaches.But the water is horrible.  Litter of all kinds (I’m talking nappies and toothbrushes) are sadly all too easy to find.  The daily raking by tractor does a great job clearing the sand, but does little for the water.Bali is on a long and excellent journey to be plastic free.  Hopefully with that comes a cleaner overall environment that we are all responsible for."
Sheep_green,"Cardiff, UK",Sep 2019,"Seminyak Beach tends to be busier than the nearby beach of Kuta but the break can still be very strong. There are plenty of hotels and cafes offering sunbeds and lots of places to grab a snack and drink. However it is also possible to find slightly quieter areas, with plenty of space for everyone."
Jane M,"Bolton, UK",Sep 2019,This has to be one of the most beautiful sights ever it’s something every one who visits Bali has to see
Laurin K,"Victoria, Canada",Sep 2019,"A great long stretch of beach, great for watersports and sunsets! Fairly busy as most of the hotels are right on the beach, but a great spot when in Seminyak. Sand is super soft and lovely on the southern section of the beach!"
Jerry G,"Horseshoe Bay, TX",Sep 2019,We visited on September 18th and it was very nice.   Big waves added to the fun.  Nice sand.A great place to visit if you want to get out of the pool and join the crowd of beach people 🤣🤣
Richard W,"Kingscote, UK",Sep 2019,"Been down the beach a couple of times, lots of waves, ideal for 🏄‍♂️ 🏄🏻‍♀️, but no good for swimming, 🚩 everywhere, only got approached by 7 beach vendors while we were there for the 1 hour before we headed back inland away from the ☀️. "
Niels H,25 contributions,Oct 2018,"While in Seminyak we spent many hours at the Seminyak beach , great swimming and activities happening everywhere , easy to get a cool beer also"
greatlife64,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,"During my recent stay at Batu Belig Seminyak, we had several opportunities and enjoyed walking the long stretches of Seminyak beaches. Nice, fine sand and easy to walk. Not crowded, unlike Kuta. Particularly enjoyed the evening walk, the beautiful sunsets and just simply watching the waves ... nice and relaxing! "
John W,"Croydon, UK",Aug 2019,Great views and always busy and things to see. Out hotel Samaya on the beach front and we did walk along and saw shrines and restaurants
James A,"Essex, UK",Sep 2019,Less busy than Kuta or Padma - and cleaner too! Great for a long walk towards Seminyak Square. Can’t fault it
Leicaman8,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"Kuta beach is hectic jammed with small beer stalls , plastic chairs and cheap beer and many hawkers while Seminyak beach has a different feel with more surf 🏄‍♀️ schools , more upmarket beach bars with bean bags and Bali umbrellas eg. La Plancha . Less hawkers as well . I recommend morning walk in beach towards Legian and Kuta for people watching and notice the changes as you head towards Legian and Kuta . "
MancJRG,"Warrington, UK",Sep 2019,"Seminyak is a long beach that merges into Legian and Kuta as you head towards the airport.  It's a wide beach with good waves for surfing and body boarding.  Watch out for rip tides/currents and follow beach flags for safe swimming.  The beach is quite coarse at points with broken coral and shells, so wear your water shoes if you go swimming.The beach has a few local sellers who approach to offer their crafts, a simple 'no thankyou' and you are left in peace - no hard sales chat.  There are a few dogs on the beach too but are often searching for shade under a lounger and not approaching people.  My one grievance is there are a few rivers from the town that run straight into the ocean and appears grey and unclean. "
Vishal W,35 contributions,Aug 2019,"This one word describes the beach best. I took a bike from Kuta for a day tour to Seminyak and wasn't disappointed. Lovely, clean beach that wasn't as busy as Kuta. Best part was the evening sunset walk by the beach back to Kuta."
Sailesh D,"London, UK",Feb 2019,"It is a great place to visit. White hot sandy beach all round. Very busy place, Lots of restaurants and plenty to do or just relax on the beach."
Deb321_13,"Bethlehem, PA",Sep 2019,A great beach.  Clean  went for sunset. Was amazing. Can sit in bean bag chairs if you eat or buy a drink. Does not have to be alcoholic. The sunset was awesome!
benny,3 contributions,Sep 2019,Not many people on the beach when I visited.  I’m not sure if it was because of the wind or because of the black sand.  
dmcallis73,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2019,Recommend during they day it is nice. And definitely go at night to one of the bats to sit on a beanbag to relax with a drink.
WERUN MARBELLA,"Marbella, Spain",Sep 2019,"If you want a great sunset at the beach, this is the place. I let the images speaks for itself. We came about 17:30 and the sun went down in the most magical way around 18:15. Film of the sunset can be viewed on our Instagram: @werun_com "
chins01,"Brooklyn, NY",Aug 2019,It's a nice beach but great views at sunset but there are definitely nicer beaches in Bali.  The beaches over in Uluwatu are cleaner and more beautiful.The nice part about this beach is that it's one long continuous beach. We ended up walking all the way from Canggu to Seminyak and then down to Legian and Kuta.
Granules2013,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2019,"Walked along this beach a few times in the morning, nice to get their early before it gets too busy. Great spot to do a learn to surf class. "
Marjan,"Kuta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,We spent hours just strolling on this beautiful beach and tried some bars along the promenade. Very nice to see sunset also. 
val brauninger,13 contributions,Sep 2019,Long long sandy beach - plenty of places to eat and drink Sun bed prices are very negotiable so haggle hard
Davidgoodkarma,"McAllen, TX",Sep 2019,If you wish to bask in a postcard-perfect Bali sunset then Seminyak beach is where you wanna be! Fun bars and beautiful friendly people make this beach a fun favorite of mine! Traveling half around the world to join my friends on this exotic island is well worth the jet lag... We’ve just arrived and we’re already glowing in Seminyak’s golden hour sunset!
Freedom85315,"Tanjung Benoa, Indonesia",Sep 2019,Wow sunset at Seminyak beach do not miss it! So many people such good fun! Felt like being at a hippy festival loved it! Bright colourful bean bags and parasols decorate the beach. Great food and drink and the beach bars (honestly don't bother with the up market bars restaurants you'll miss out on the vibe!) great bands playing and the beach sellers with their sarongs etcetera for sale just add to the vibe! A highlight evening and a sunset that is unreal! Go!!! 
donmalcolm,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2019,"The beaches of Bali are rightly famous for miles of fabulous white sand, surf, and beautiful young people enjoying their holiday.It is obvious by the tractors and heavy machinery parked inconspicuously here and there that a deal of effort is placed into presenting the various beaches in pristine condition each day.The warning flags provide notice to the unwary that swimming can be dangerous in places - as you would expect at a surf beach.The vendors hiring out sun loungers and surfboards seem to do a great trade, as I imagine would the wondering peddlers of beer and ice creams.So, if you’re young and into sun, surf and having a great day out, the beach is the place to be."
mariasG9650QU,17 contributions,Aug 2019,"Visited in August 2019 and went to the beach in the morning and evening. Always crowded, rubbish everywhere and sewage running into the sea. Wouldn't recommend to anyone, beaches in NZ or AUS are so much better."
lkamphuis,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2019,I’m not a fan of most Bali beaches - when you have Australian beaches it’s no comparison but I did enjoy early morning walks along the beach before it’s hot and the hustle and bustle  of Bali kicks in !Was a great way to spend the day 
Lobinqld,"Hobart, Australia",Aug 2019,Lovely place to stroll along and enjoy the sites & sounds of beach grown micro businesses.   Some great names on these places.   Enjoy the stroll & the vibe
SteveDWS,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019,Water is murky and is actually quite rough in most areas. Lack of bars and restaurant indicates it is not really for tourists. Of 3 days we visited once for 10 minutes. Ordinary. Don’t waste your time.
San P,"Moncton, Canada",Aug 2019,"Super nice day at the beach, the only downfall was getting approached all the time for renting chairs or buying goods!"
Caitlyn S,10 contributions,Aug 2019,"Nice enough, soft sand, very strong current in water and big dumping waves. In my opinion I would say not safe for swimming, but OK to paddle if you're careful."
ckrken,5 contributions,Aug 2019,"You have to visit Seminyak forget Kuta that has just gone downhill. Seminyak is the place to stay, go to Double Six beach, meet Judi, Lollipop, Ina, Tina, Jennifer, Eric, Milky, Martin and the rest of the sellers and beer boys.  Best place in the world to buy a beer and sit in comfort and watch the world go buy.  Buy your souvenirs or get your nails done even have a massage I can personally guarantee you will get a better deal and treatment from these people than any of the shops, markets or spas that you attend.  We did.  There are so many warangs to get cheap meals, it is cheaper to stay here than any place in Kuta or Legian. Kura-Kura buses run regularly and travel all over the main parts of Bali. I simply can go on and on but go and find out yourself."
Vera Z,"Beirut, Lebanon",Aug 2019,"The beach in Seminyak is amazing especially for Surfers, but not that good for swimmers since it's always high tide. The entrance is free but if you want to sit on a bed you will have to pay around 100K Rupiah per bed if you have good negotiable skills since they can ask for more."
Elenishaz,26 contributions,Aug 2019,Sunset in beautiful Seminyak never disappoint. This is my 16th Bali trip and always love looking across the ocean and watching the sunset
Denise P,"Australind, Australia",Aug 2019,Relax or get surf lessons clean beach very relaxing can get a massage or buy things Small restaurant serving local food beer and food 
Brook R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2019,For one of Bali’s main beaches this is disappointing. Whereas some effort has been made to tidy it up particularly in front of the nicer hotels many people are taking their dogs for a walk and making no effort to big up their poo from the sand so not a pleasant walking experience. Also still many strays despite efforts to collar some of them. There are also a few streams emanating from the town that run across the beach with foul smelling water to paddle through. Not many people sunbathing in it which probably sums it up.
ECB,20 contributions,Aug 2019,Loved the choice of restaurants and sunsets. Beautiful beach with golden sand. Will visit soon. Very romantic. 
dotdim,"Keysborough, Australia",Aug 2019,Amazing and clean beach with great waves.  No crazy hustle here. Hotels and bars right at your fingertips.  Great spot to chill or satin or go for that brisk walk or run
anderssons,16 contributions,Aug 2019,"we moved to the south of bali to see their beaches and was dissappointed. the sewerage from the city flows directly to the beach where most of the tourist swim., we have decided to go on a bar near by and watch the sunset instead which was okay phuket thailand's beach is way more better., "
Stuart W,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2019,"The beach is vast and extends for miles with beautiful waters, lots of bars and restaurants dotted along the shoreline. Lots of surfing. Great place for watching the Balinese sunsets. "
Wang0107,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"Our villa is ten minutes walks from this beach so we went there three times with kids. Compared with other very commercialised beach (Jimbaran), this beach is still having a feeling of openness, wildness and quietness. The sunset there are beautiful! "
Kenn Are M,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2019,"We found the Seminyak area to be very accommodating, as when we searched for places, spots we had no trouble finding a good place. Many bars, small shops selling Nik naks and discobars, restaurant etc. On the beach, you can buy sodas, including beer. No hard liquor though. The Pantai Seminyak is an awesome beach, allthough Bali have many of them, this one is greatly sought after by tourists."
Jonnytwosocks,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"After all id heard of Bali, its wonderful beaches, I was quite shocked - ive seen lots better. The sand was dark and littered, and the beach was over loaded with their trades people constantly annoying you. Not impressed at all... im praying Bali has better to offer. "
Tony,"Paris, France",Jul 2019,Very nice place.....not too much crowdy..lot of restos..cafes on the beach..relaxing area. Enjoy surfing practice...
sawhneyjs,"New York City, NY",Aug 2019,The Money Changers here scam you with posting high rates outside their doors. When you give them a  $100 Bill they will keep it on top of the counter and pile up the Indonesian Rupiah bills on the counter. The conversion is approximately 1.4 million and change. This they will convert in 50000 Rupiah notes which will amount to between 28 to 30 notes per $100. They will then pick up the notes to hand you the pile and will CRAFTILY PULL OUT a large chunk of the notes. The bigger the amount the easier it is for them to pull out more notes. An unsuspecting traveler will put the money in their purse or pocket and later realise that they were scammed. In our case we changed $500 and our due amount was 7.35 million. They handed us a shade over 5 million. We realised this when we arrived at the hotel. The hotel staff went with security and he immediately took the local currency back without even counting and handed us back $500. WHAT A SCAM. 😡
MOTASEMAG,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"If you want to walk around And see the city and do some shopping while at the same time eat and have a coffee in a very nice place like an open area in the street, this would be the best location"
Seema G,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2019,Clean and slightly rough sand beach.  Beach facilities are just ok kind of. We were using Marriott beach facilities. 
JVA64,"Beijing, China",Aug 2019,"Beautiful long and wide beach. Best place to watch sunset. However several open creeks discharge raw sewage into the ocean and need to be crossed by foot. Given the purchasing power on this beach, this problem should have been fixed long ago. "
Alicia S,"O'Fallon, IL",Aug 2019,"The beach was absolutely beautiful. My husband and I had an amazing time out there. The only downside, there were no public beach chairs and umbrellas provided for people visiting the beach. "
LRobinson2013,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2019,"Clean, peaceful, and relaxing.  Not a lot of people here so great for just experiencing the serenity of nature and sound of the waves."
connierideout16,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",Aug 2019,"A wonderful stretch of beach, clean and with some waves perfect to try your hand at a surfboard or body board. "
Kerrie Birch,7 contributions,Aug 2019,"It’s nice to see that they have cleaned up their act, it was so much cleaner and nicer to have that morning stroll. In the afternoon you get a lot of Balinese trying to sell you things that can be a tad annoying after a while. We managed to see a baby turtle trying to make its why back into the the ocean so that was really special. Go early and miss the crowed is my tip."
Roger-North,"Altrincham, UK",Aug 2019,"A beautiful, clean and well managed beach. Very good parking for scooters, and not fat to walk from Seminyak Square. The beach is several km long. Plenty of beach refreshments and food from a wide range of beach cafes, restaurants and bars, all well-priced and good bean-bag seats. The atmosphere moves up a notch once the sun goes down, with live bands and DJ’s given first place. Watching surfers ride the crested waves is a pleasurable way to spend an afternoon."
Mentari,"Sanur, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Seminyak beach always become must visit place in Bali, with the stunning sunset, black sand. The best time to enjoy is between 4pm to 6pm. "
Msbbel,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2019,Nothing more than a beautiful sunset at Seminyak beach! Arrive at 5.30pm latest and watch a clear view of the sun setting. Extremely vibrant vibe here along the beach with beach clubs and restaurants turning up the music. Expect a lot of people and patience to snap photos with nobody in it 😅
Cassandra Silvi... W,"Paris, France",Jul 2019,Nice beach to walk along and watch the waves and sunset. Close to sunset it was a bit crowded but I felt safe and comfortable. Clean sand and nice people.
Jen B,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2019,Sooooo the beach is beautiful but pretty busy. The waves are also way higher than I had thought. It was fun to jump in but only to our knees for safety reasons!
E10ne,"Arnhem, The Netherlands",Aug 2019,"Surfing and surf shops everywhere Great beach, clean and many bars and restaurants, beds available to a fair price "
SmilyBergen,"Bergen, Norway",Aug 2019,"Great sand, funny waves, lovely sunset, not too crowded. Sunbeds costs 100.000 each. Hope to be back!"
quiknett,"Springfield, MO",Sep 2018,"Seminyak is a better location then kita,  for elder people like me , prefer  Semnyak then Kuta too crowded and noisy. Seminyak has a better store  too."
Scott T,"Bangkok, Thailand",Aug 2019,The beach is fantastic. Approximately 100 meters from shore to where the beach ends. A number of beach pubs with live music in the evening.. very relaxing. The waves rolling in add that hypnotic vibe.
Jay Murray,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Beach is a must see - just be ready for the market sellers there - lovely people who are there to make a living for themselves, they go around selling their wares, be polite in saying no - other tourists there just ignore them - which I found was quite rude. A nice ‘thank you - but no thanks’ goes a long way."
StephanieJeffrey,"Winsford, UK",May 2019,Such a stunning beach to watch the sunset. There is a swing on the beach also which is a lovely touch. It was fairly clean and tidy. Lots of bars along the beach and chill out spots 
Timo10101,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2019,"Bali is famous for many things, however beaches and sea swimming is not the best here, unless you're a surfer. The water was cold - expected as it's an ocean, and the sea waves were quite strong and turning any swim attempt into a soft fight. "
Wulan C,17 contributions,Aug 2019,Great spot but overcrowded ..dogs roaming around..cafe s expensive went to Botanica for froze and sangria just behind the beach..
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",Jun 2019,Beautiful sunset!!! Loved watching the big waves crashing and seeing local Balinese families enjoying the beach/offering blessings. Don't miss the sunset - its magical.
holdayluv,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2019,"We went to go to the beach only to find that to get on and off the beach, if you are not staying at the beachfront resorts is a nightmare. You have to walk miles out of your way to get on and off the beach which has open drains emptying into it that smell terrible. I hated walking through the dirty water."
Ruud & Debby,"Capelle aan den IJssel, The Netherlands",Jul 2019,"Go here if you like to enjoy the sunset while having a nice cocktail on the beach. Lots of beach bars and beach clubs to choose from. A bit more expensive then Kuta, but therefore also a bit more stylish."
CassavaHK,"Sandik, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"Having been to quieter beaches this was packed and really not that nice. Way too busy, noisy and touts everywhere.  If you like the buzz, crowds then it’s the beach for you. If you like privacy and peace stay away. Sunset was nice but you can’t take a decent photo without a single person in it! "
S p,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"I'm writing this review to warn the many people that come to Seminyak beach of the very powerful currents in this part of the beach which could be deadly. Many people have died including my cousin who just drowned 3 days ago getting caught in the rip tide. He was a very good swimmer with exceptional athletic ability, but the currents on this beach are very strong and come all of a sudden. There are many articles on this if you search specifically for it,  but they get no publicity because the big corporate hotels need to keep the tourists coming in. My advice is you can stay in the hotels, but please find another beach to swim in. Please read up on rip tide currents if you do plan to stay there. The site wont allow me to post links to other sites. Thank you"
karlmonty,100 contributions,Aug 2019,Nice beach with some really good pubs / bars along the strip most of my days spent here some really good spots to have a drink an watch the sun go down 👌👌
EveT205,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,I like this beach. Nothing much to fault but i just wish the washroom can be free and more water points to wash off our sandy feet.
Umang A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,"A other beautiful white sand beach in Bali, bear to city center and party place so sometimes may be dirty "
Razor Ray,"County Meath, Ireland",Jul 2019,Took a walk down seminyak beach with my 2 teenage boys and it was sad to see the amount of rubbish lying on the beach. There  is a stream that flows into the sea there also and it is basically a dustbin with all sorts of rubbish dumped in it which is flowing into the ocean. It is very sad and it is something the Indonesian government needs to address. Aside from that the beach is a surfers beach with huge waves. Could be so beautiful.....
Joanna L,"Davao City, Philippines",Jul 2019,"Such a striking difference from the other beaches.  Seminyak beach has a classier atmosphere, so much space, and it doesn't have the haggling vendors at Kuta beach.  The price to lounge, for food and drinks is much more here but you get what you pay for."
Guillex13,"Mendoza, Argentina",Jul 2019,"Nice beach and large so you could be in a place without others next to you.A black sand beach, big waves, if you like surf that's the location.Big and beautiful sunsets, book a place in one of the beach sand places restaurants and enjoy.For me it's a 7."
Natty,World,Jul 2019,We like Seminyak beach. Very nice beach & clean. Good for walk on the beach. You can spend time long day. Have many restaurants & Hotel. Beautiful the Sunset there...Will be back soon.💃🌺Natty🕺🌺Walter 
Richard S,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2019,Love going to this beach maybe because it feels like I’m home every time I go there know a lot of people and have good friendships over the years ... restaurant close by everything is busy on a Sunday afternoon 
Brindle24,17 contributions,Jul 2019,We chilled there all day and watched the sunset! Dogs running around was crazy but fun at same time! Watching the surfers is class! People trying to sell you things is super annoying sometimes. Do t by a scarf for more than 50K
Paul P,"London, Canada",Jul 2019,Fantastic sunset . Many beach front bars  and  sitting areas.  Clean for long walks  and did I mention the sunset ? Pick a spot  with your fav beverage and camera ready
thaiteadps,4 contributions,Jul 2019,Acces is easy via the parking lot as there s little access to beaches from Seminyak.Filled up with beachclubs charging high end rupiahs.we strolled further and end up in  The Rose Social which has our fav Frose & Sangria.
Ness,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2019,Gorgeous before the crowds and hawkers get there. Lots of cafes to stop for breakfast along the way and a nice breeze to keep you cool. 
blackeldo,"Kiama, Australia",Jun 2019,"….This 5km section of the continuous KUTA-CANGGU beach strip rates AVERAGE by Bali mainland standards but BELOW AVERAGE by world standards….You don’t come to Bali for great beaches...correction, you may come to Bali to sit on the beach in tropical conditions when it’s  freezing at home, sipping a cut price cocktail yada…..but the beach will not be whelming…. not on the mainland at least.I’m a beach blogger with over 3 million hits – get back to BALI annually and always make a point of cycling/walking SEMINYAK – stayed inland there a few years back. I’ve visited thousands of beaches over 40 years and would not rate BALI MAINLAND’s best in my top 500. Offshore LEMBONGAN may just scrape in. IN CONTRAST gorgeous and spectacular ARTUH BEACH** (offshore NUSA PENIDA) would make my top 10. Maybe even top 3.But hey, if you seldom see a beach, you may think SEMINYAK the ants pants. As FERRIS BUELLER’S bookie never said: “Sure beats a sand-pit in south SPRINGFIELD”.See. what we have here is a long strip of sand where it’s easy to find a fairly deserted section - or to sit with a crowd on rather swish sun-loubge/umbrella combinations if that’s your jam. These more crowded parts are outside the bigger resorts (all sized high-end places back the beach along here) + where roads from inland (more accommodation) access the sand.There’s a gradual change heading north. South end near the big DOUBLE SIX** resort has sand similar to KUTA-LEGIAN: kinda tan-grey (rather than the gorgeous white stuff when I first visited in ‘75). Heading north it darkens somewhat – although never reaching the light black of CANGGU BCH immediately north. Most areas are quite wide but it does narrow in sections.Activity changes too – the first 400m is a continuation of the crowded KUTA-LEGIAN scene. 3 or 4 beach bars with cushions/small tables on the sand are a real scene around sunset. Moving north it becomes quieter with gaps between crowded areas. The far north can be very uncrowded.TIPS – those beach clubs: maybe 4 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw one with at least 1000 people on the sand!!!! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems high end. Dozens of all budget places within a 10 min stroll inland.- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.- wet season is not the best time to visit – lotsa rubbish and dirty storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here (hotels/airlines offer great low season packages) – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).SUM UP – an okay beach, just don’t expect WHITEHAVEN."
327andrer,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Our first visit to Bali and our first outing/sightseeing/exploring adventure started along Seminyak beach. Excellent intruduction to what could be expected of the rest of the islands very busy and touristy beach areas. Holiday vibe came through very strong. Many nice pubs and restaurants along the promonade walk. We walked for what felt like hours and never got bored or felt unintertained. You can rent a surf board just about everywhere, endless watersport possibilities etc etc etc. And then of course the sun-set, when hundreds and hundreds of people descend onto the beach. Great party vibe, sundowners and good music of any flavour. A must experience"
HonestTravelReviews,"Spalding, UK",Jul 2019,"We got a taxi from Ubud to Seminyak, as we have heard lots of good things about it. The beach is lovely and scenery is lovely but has a strict set of rules when comes to where you can and can’t swim. Most of it is where you can’t swim, it took me ages to find an area where I could purely swim and not be told I couldn’t. Me and my fiancé got the luck of the draw with the sun beds, as we were able to separate ourselves from the crowds and only cost us 200k rph for the both of us. If you don’t like people in the way of your view, then it’s not the place for you. As you’ll see crowds of people trying to get ‘the perfect’ pictures for not just minutes but sometimes hours (clearly Instagrammers and photo-shoppers) and this came a bit frustrating because it made you look as if you were staring at them, even though they are in your way of the beautiful blue sea. I have heard a lot of rumours about Bali having the best sunsets in the world and I can honestly say, that is Chinese whispers, as I have seen better in the UK. "
Alen S,"Berlin, Germany",Jul 2019,Few kilometers long beach. Not so crowded. Waves are good for surfing. A lot of boards to rent. Or you can take 2 hours lessons. Sand is nice white with black patches that comes from volcanic stones.The beach is not of the cleanest but is pretty good.There is a lot of restaurants on the beach where you can chill. Prices are above average. Worth spending some days here.
Swifto,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"Living in WA where our beaches are awesome, reviewing other beaches is contextual!Large sandy beach, lots of local beach bars and options on the beach itself including surf lessons.You will get approached by sellers with everything from “genuine Bali Rolex” to sarongs and pedicures! but they were always good humoured and respectful with us, when bartering and even when we were not interested. You can hire a sunbed for about 100k each and often bean bags are free if you are ordering food/drink from a beach bar Beach was clean when we were there. Its mostly not surf life saving patrolled and there are signs warning of rips etc. There was often a strong swell although the beach is shallow entry  to the water - plenty of family friendly surf and access, just be mindful Great place to watch the sunset (again in context compared to WA 😂) or for a long beach walk on the edge of the water. (Walk from Seminyak beach through doublesix, Legion. And onwards!)"
Peter A,"Somerville, Australia",Jul 2019,Stayed at Pelangi Hotel and Spa which is right next to Seminyak beach. The beach is clean and has some good waves. There are heaps of restaurants and bars along the beach which have either undercover/outdoors  tables and chairs or outdoors lounges and beach bags. A great spot to sunbake and swim during the day. And a fantastic spot to have a cocktail and feed while watching the sunset. Loved it. 
moviegeekjn,"Phoenix, AZ",Jul 2019,"After seeing only underwhelming Sanur Beach previously, Seminyak Beach represents its polar opposite. The sunsets are fabulous and there are many entry points to this beautiful beach with fine sand; it's like I told my traveling partner: this place is like a ""poor man's Maldives.""  This area will be my primary beach area if and when I return to Bali"
Rob w,28 contributions,Jul 2019,Seminyak beach is a great place to hang out for those sundowners after a hard day’s surfing and watch the sunset with a cold beer or cocktail sitting on one of the many rainbow beanbags!
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,"loved the sunset view ,local food,vibes of the beach..surfing shots....every bit of it...clean beach but crowded....you can spend the whole day"
Deanne,"Coulsdon, UK",Jul 2019,"It’s a great beach but it’s packed from dawn to dusk with people it’s more like Costa Del Sol. There are so many nicer beaches in Bali but then Seminyak is all about clubs, restaurants, bars etc so it depends what you’re looking for. "
Ben D,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2019,"This beach is similar to Kuta, grey sand, and strange milky creeks flowing out into the water. I would not swim in that. I didn’t particularly like walking on the sand.Seminyak is to me, a quieter version of Kuta, but with nicer shops, better food, and more relaxed locals and tourists.I love Seminyak, just don’t bother going to the beach."
Sian F,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Jul 2019,We visited Double Six area of Seminyak beach and everything was very nice. We watched the sunset one night and if you want lounge chairs you have to pay. We paid $20 for 5. There are many bars and places to eat and it wasn’t too busy. 
Georgia,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"Loads of cool we spots , lounges cost about $2.50 NZ for a day . Bean bags are free as long as you buy food and drinks . Surf lessons cost  are between $20-$30 for a hour and half lesson or $5-$10 for surfboard hire for 2 hours . Awesome music and vibes "
ADL Foodie,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"Beach is great for sunsets, waves were big, san was dirty and stray dogs everywhere. Prefer the Australian beaches! "
globalfoodie87,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"The sand lacks luster, but great to surf...you can access for free if you walk just past potato head, or go through them and order lunch then use the beanbags provided. "
louishems,1 contribution,Jul 2019,"Very clean beach that is well maintained, lots of entertainment options at night. Very busy but yet cozy, great place to relax."
Will_ashcr,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"I have been coming to Bali for a number of years. I always enjoy the ocean and the beaches, and Seminyak is one of my favourites. The beach is long, and the sea looks amazing. However, the issue of plastic pollution on the beach is really starting to get bad. Twice a day we would walk 3 or 4 km down the beach and we would pick up at least 100 plastic straws, empty water bottles, individual mint wrappers, bottle tops etc etc. I implore the local authorities to make more of an effort to keep these beaches clean and plastic free, otherwise tourism will start to decline. Nobody likes to lie on a beach coated in plastic rubbish. Employing some designated beach cleaners is the first step. In summary, it’s a beautiful beach, but it needs some urgent action to keep it that way. If you’re on the beach, and see plastic rubbish, be a good person and pick it up."
ross m,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Take earplugs for the loud music in the open bars. The Balinese have no idea when it comes to volume. Volume means quality to them, so be warned. . . "
pc-and-dc,"Hoylake, UK",Jun 2019,"I was disappointed that the sea at Seminyak beach was far too rough to swim in during our visit in June, with red flags flying for the whole week. Not ideal for small children or weak swimmers. Whilst the huge waves looked spectacular, the undercurrent was very strong and many individuals were caught unawares and pulled over by the wash of the waves. There were only a few small and not very clearly marked displays indicating the dangers of the rip tide The warungs at the back of the beach were lively in the evening and a great place to watch the sunset.The litter debris and dog dirt on the beach was not so great. Sorry, Seminyak but you have got to get on top of the beach hygiene. It is a shame that such a lovely beach is marred by this issue."
Lady Bee,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2019,Just amazing. water just great beach is extremely clean.  Very safe. wonderful sunsets.  Good for surfing in the morning huge waves
Ken L,"Northamptonshire, UK",Jul 2019,"Good beach. Sun beds and umbrellas available. The sea breeze keeps the temperature very pleasant. Not too crowded. The waves however are very high, even at a shallow depth. Not suitable for younger children.  Surprisingly few surfers."
spendinheritance,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,WE had a wonderful time here sitting on bean bags watching the sun  set having a few drinks & food so many people on the beach this was something that should be done what a wonderful way to spend the afternoon/evening. Lots of great places along the beach
Emily,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2019,Great beach frequented only by tourists during the day and locals in the evening. Enjoyed the end of the day with a beautiful sunset and very good cocktails.
Kiwigal2015,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",Jul 2019,"This looked like a nice beach, especially where they had groomed the sand. The area closer to the water that had not been groomed, had lots of small bits of rubbish (mainly bottle tops) on it. There was lots of sun loungers and drink/food stalls along the beach front. Several areas had ‘surfing lessons’ available."
John K,6 contributions,Jul 2019,Lovely place to go straight across the small road. Visited a few times good surf waves. And seating for many.
Liv Karin,21 contributions,Jun 2019,"The beach in it self was really beautiful and a perfect place to watch the sunset, chill in the sun or take a dip in the ocean. But there were sellers constantly coming up to us which was a bit annoying. In addition, there were few facilities or other such as that. There were some sunbeds, but no showers etc. The waves was also a bit too much."
Leah C,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2019,"Good spot to learn to surf.  Sand is a mix of black volcanic and silica, so looks fairly good and very little rubbish.  Lots of access points on to the beach and variety of pop-up style bars."
ed edwards,Fiji,Jun 2019,Expansive beach that has awful riptides. Lots of umbrellas and and lounge chairs. All are for hire. Swim at your hotel pools.
Finemind1st,"Seattle, WA",Jul 2019,Spent some time in the sun and people watched. Time well spent! There's tons of hotels/bars/restos to get lunch or dinner at when/if you get hungry. Enjoy!
samchy,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019,The beach in Seminyak is okay but there are plenty more that are much better. The beach is average and we only went there for a walk in the evening. There are plenty restaurants near by so a good walk and many places to eat after the walk. 
Lauren01,"Porthcawl, UK",Jun 2019,"We have spent a few days at the beach near Seminyak. The beach is clean, offers small waves for surfing and was monitored by lifeguards. "
flynniesmum,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Lovely at sundown but so many hawkers! If you can put up with trying to relax but be awoken by the locals aiming to sell then youll love it. Great bars & restaurants
Grant B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"A difficult to access beach hidden on the ""other"" side of a number of large villas and hotels.  You can reach it down a path at Ku De Ta or at Jalan Kayu Aya, just along from Motel Mexicola.  If you are of the white Kiwi or Aussie brigade take your sunscreen and pay for a sun umbrela if you intend to spend any time at the beach.I am not a surfer but the surf was quite large and to my untrained eye seemed to be what a number of doctors might order grommets and experts alike to savour.  I presume the waves arose from beach breaks, and on the day we were there we observed a number of perfect A frames."
AliciaCecilia,"Guangzhou, China",Jun 2019,"The beach is long. Connected with Kuta  and Legian and Petinget or something similar . Well is the same beach . It is not paradise at all . You can not swim only if you are a fan of surfing and beach clubs to drink and watch sunset . Of course nice for long walks.  At sunset is lively , full of local people and dogs  .... too many . No very clean . They have to clean every day with machines and full of offerings little basket with flowers . The nice touch is the colorful umbrellas and lounges  to relax ."
Edenescape S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"Relatively clean , good thunderous surf the days we visited, plenty of surf schools , people watching and beach club options . Lovely sunset ....  a loud and busy place "
DianneKamerling,"Cooroy, Australia",May 2019,"Nice beach, with some good bars/eateries along the foreshore, not much surf as such, but great for children to go swimming"
Joyce R,56 contributions,Jun 2019,Pretty beach but as Bali is it’s not an empty and relaxing beach. Nice place to catch the sunset. Not really family friendly 
Hollie_Mariee,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2019,"Lovely beach with dark sand, we sat at beach bar called Champlung which was perfect for people watching .The sea was crazy and not safe for swimming."
Barry D,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,One of the great places to watch the sunset - suggest you try Taris Bali Bar as the one of the best spots to relax and watch
Scott8446,"Glasgow, UK",Jun 2019,Went here to watch the sunset and walk to a restaurant. Beach was very busy but clean. Had lots of sand. 
Wineglass2000,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"We came here last year and came again this year - bcos of the beach. In the morning,  crashing of the waves have such a soothing and calming effect. You see families enjoying along the beach. In the evening, you see many big, colourful umbrellas lined along the beach and the whole place comes to live with people jumping into the big waves (the beach very safe and shallow - below knee depth for 50 to 80 m from shore). Beautiful sunset and nice place to people-watch trying to take the perfect Ig photos. Really an awesome place to chillax and hangout even after sunset. "
J70mcr,"London, UK",Jun 2019,Nice clean beach with amazing sunsets. Does get very busy at sunset time! People are selling sun beds for the day just make sure you sort a price out and don’t take the first piece they give you!!
Yasin H,9 contributions,Jun 2019,Very good place for evening ... Good and clean. Cleanliness can be increase.I would like to come again with my grandchildren.
Amazing Lucca,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2019,Nice & clean beach for sunrise & sunset.I'd come back to this place.I love that you can bring your fur babies.
Dee-College,"Manly, Australia",May 2019,"I have rated Seminyak beach 5 stars not because it is a beach where you would like to swim - keep that for the pool at your hotel. But it is beautiful to watch at sunset, to watch the locals playing football on Sunday, to watch the endless parade of planes landing, and for walks before the heat of the day. Good too for surfing, but not for swimming."
jennie157,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Jun 2019,"Beach was lovely and clean and the service great 😊 nice clean sand area with plenty of provision of service for surfing lessons, relaxing on lounges and good prices on drinks 😊"
Nailbrush,"Cowfold, UK",Jun 2019,This beach is more for those wanting a quieter experience in Bali. A few music bars compete with acoustic sets along the beach from 5:00pm - 11:00pm but then everything winds down. It’s a shame if your night is just starting.
Martin W,"Gravesend, UK",Jun 2019,Wide sandy beach and lots of sunbeds. Music systems come out around 4pm in preparation for sunset and an evening meal on the beech or just a few beers 
Judith W,"Oakleigh, Australia",Jun 2019,Walked to beach around 10am as it was windy and the waves very beach was closed for swimming . However we hired a chair each for hour and enjoyed the passing traffic.Had a paddle to my ankles but the undercurrent was very strong.
NisheshV,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Nice beach with strong waves good for surfing. Nice restaurant by beach makes up for good vibes. Must do in Bali. Great massage place by beach
Ruslena,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2019,"Good morning exercise around the block and beach. Unfortunately, the beach is not so well kept except for areas bordering the restaurants situated on the beach. Dogs pooping on the beach are unsightly too. Apart than that, all’s well ends well."
Nemesis@666,"Doha, Qatar",Jun 2019,The sea was a bit rough but we spent a lovely afternoon there. The sand is dark. It's by some nice hotels and bars. The are no lifeguards around so be safe of you're with children. There are locals from whom you could rent a beach bed for 50000 rupiya. They'll even bring you beer or other cold drinks for a reasonable price. The sunset was beautiful! We enjoyed ourselves. 
Dhanesh Metrani,"Belgaum, India",Jun 2019,"This is a very vibrant beach at Bali, Went here in evening with my wife . The approach road to the beach is narrow , full of cars and motorcycles. Very highly recommended to visit the beach"
Ali Cappa,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,Seminyak Beach has so many great restaurants but sitting on the beach with a Bintan and watching the sunset is so tranquil.  Beaches are as clean as they can be in Bali
guptaeti,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2019,"Fun, clean, serenity.Had lots of fun making and castles with hubby & kids.No water sports we did.Indication to swim only between Flags with red & yellow stripes.Waves beyond that point were rough and risky for non swimmers. "
emilyjp,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2019,"Seminyak beach is nothing to rave about. It’s more of a surf beach, you can’t really swim in it. Lots of people just chilling and relaxing. It’s nice for a stroll or to watch the sunset on a clear day"
TJ1,"Johannesburg, South Africa",May 2019,"Looks like any other beach, not the crystal clear and blue green beaches seen in photos. Good to just chill for the afternoon where you can hire sunbeds and an umbrella. Also good walking distance from Seminyak Square and Village "
Geary W,3 contributions,May 2019,"Just returned from a amazing trip to Bali, where during our 14 day adventure we visited Ubud, Sanur, Nusa Dua and Seminyak which unfortunately was the low point of our trip. We had been to Seminyak on a previous visit to Bali and didn't have any problems but this time We fell foul of unscrupulous money changers. They used misdirection and slight of hand to scam us out of approx 1 million Rupiahs. My advice is stick to the main money changers on main roads and always double check your cash before walking away. I went back and confronted my foe's and they claimed that i had dropped the money as I walked away which of course was rubbish, I did however manage to get half of the ill gotten gains back from them when they thought i might have called the police."
PeCi,"Bratislava, Slovakia",Jun 2019,"It has all a tourist needs - little bars and restaurants, surf rentals and of course sun umbrellas & sunbeds to rent for about 150K Rp..Its not as crowded as Kuta, which we personally appreciated."
Penny L,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"We went there on both nights of our trip to chill and to relax. With the second day, we rented two beach chairs for my Boyfriend to suntan for 3hours (@ 200k rupiah). Since the main purpose of our trip was to relax, the sun sand and sea combination was heaven for us. Together with the little drinks and the stars in the sky. With the sound of waves (and of course the music) we had a really relaxing trip. And I’m missing the beach pretty badly at his moment."
Coenie K,"Riebeek-West, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Stayed in a beautiful hotel,only you realise the beach were not great.Dirty sand,plastic and cigarette buds everywhere. Come on people be proud and ź"
Skhanna441,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018,"Must visit place ,especially for sun set , worth watching. Good place for couples as well as for the families."
thaibanana,manchester,May 2019,"As a keen swimmer I was slightly disappointed that the waves and surf were too strong to go swimming. The beach is large and flat, and you can walk along it for miles. There are plenty of people hiring loungers etc. We liked all the beach bars with their brightly coloured bean bags! At night the beach comes alive, with beautiful sunsets and bands/ singers at most of the beach bars. Very relaxing except for the hawkers of which there were many! Just saw a review below about effluent and can agree - upon walking northwards along the beach towards seminyak square, there was quite a fast flowing creek that stunk. Take care where you bathe I think! There were also dogs running around and on our walks we did pass the occasional dog turd. We did see people cleaning the beach and overall it was pretty clean with just a few trouble spots."
Shelley Mac,5 contributions,May 2019,The beach was relaxing with it's wide sand and good surf. Great that you can walk along the beach for miles and also call in to visit places all along the way.
MarcieBenton0186,6 contributions,Jun 2019,"We came to Bali for beach, but this one is not what we were expected when we booked our tickets to here. Grey sand, rubbish, positive side sunsets are amazing here."
MLandM,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"While walking along Seminyak beach just north of Moonlight I crossed a creek. Brown, raw, stinking effluent was pouring into the ocean right near swimmers and surfers. About 200 litres per minute. That's 10 tonnes per hour. When I asked them, the locals knew but didn't care. It was disgusting. The prevailing current carries it northwards.Be warned. Do yourself a favour, surf Double Six instead."
siongl76,4 contributions,May 2019,This beach is a nice place to chill and recommended for sunset. The sand is fine and suitable to laze around and sun bathing. However it is not recommended for swim.
GlendaNicholson0785,4 contributions,May 2019,"Great place for sunset. Get an cocktail, listen to the bands and enjoy the view. During daytime many surfers, tourists and dogs."
Sharon N,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2019,We are a bit spoilt coming from Australia but it was a nice beach.  Liked the relaxed beach at night. Sit have a drink listen to a band. 
sanjaya,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2019,Try go to this place at sunset and you will be amazed. We have a great time in here.  But will find some other beaches

Tya A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2019,"Was here more than 3 times this week. I came here to see Sunsets. There are lots of other people from surfing, football to relax by sitting by the beach. The beach is clean. There are many people bring their dogs here for afternoon walk"
orientdesign,wateringen,May 2019,"in the center of Seminyak and enjoy the sunset on a beautiful beach. It can be super crowded but very cozy. Keep your attention, because if you order a cocktail during the rush, it may be that there is almost no alcohol in it. It happened to us in any case."
Loislovestravelling,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"It is good to visit..... but just the once. To be honest, unless you want to sit and drink, there isn’t much more to do. "
mkaes,"Luzon, Philippines",Nov 2018,"Great place to watch the sunset, resto bars are here and there, make sure you choose the best spot with great drinks menu and live music, bring your tripod to capture the timelapse of the sunset, make sure you bring enough money as the drinks are pricey! "
Deetee100,"London, UK",May 2019,"This coastline on the western side of Bali, starting from Kuta, through Legian to Seminyak is very heavily commercialised, so the beach is lined with hotels and bars and, although kept relatively clean, is still far from somewhere to relax. There are surf schools along the entire length, then people trying to sell you everything from coconuts to sarongs and hats. You‘ll have to venture further away from Denpassar to escape the crowds."
FamilyWillow,173 contributions,May 2019,As usual there were numerous dogs defacating on the beach. It's strewn with rubbish and there is a large drain flowing with poluted water.Don't let the photos cool you.
Erwin,"Ede, The Netherlands",May 2019,During sunset and after sunset on this beach the bars have live music and often 'happy hour' cocktails. Easy to have a few great nights.
MishyTravels,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,"This beach is great for keeping active, with flat firm sand perfect for walking, jogging or running.The beach is clean and scraped every morning.There are a few friendly dogs but the area comes alive at night with movies or live music, fairy lights, cocktails and food a plenty.Perfect for singles, couples or families"
Frank G,"West Pennant Hills, Australia",Apr 2019,There is no way I will ever go back to this beach.  It is the filthiest piece of ocean and sand I have ever seen  Authorities really need to clean this up. No thank you.
NIC D,France,May 2019,"nice to go into the sea or walk in the morning or go at the end of the afternoon , to sit on pouf  for the sunset , looking for the "" green ray""( le raon vert;;;°"
Herdiana Surachman,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2019,"When in Bali, me with friends always come to Petitenget Beach to enjoy the beach while waiting for sunset.Different with Kuta where on the bach so many locals sunbed, and in Double Six where so many beach bar.In Petitenget's Seminyak beach you can take your own beach towel and have your own time. Of course, there's still locals try to sell products or food, but it's because Petitenget is public beach but sometime is clearer than the two (Kuta & Double Six)"
Mariatynan,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2019,The beach was clean this time of year. Lots of restaurants where we go. Champlung is our favourite. Balinese are all pleasant.
Matthew D,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Apr 2019,"OK maybe I’m spoiled a bit by living in sight of a great beach and holidays in the Pacific Islands but I don’t particularly rate this one. Long sandy beach, not too crowded, some nice beachside bars and restaurants. The surfing is OK (again, spoiled by Hawai’i and Aotearoa) but not great. Absence of lifeguards and presence of undertow make swimming an issue. Some rubbish- not as bad as Phuket, worse than the Pacific. An oil slick present while we were there. As beaches go, if you’re looking for a long walk on a beach ((with a reasonable number of people there but not crowded or noisy) with some places to get a beer or some decent food at reasonable prices you won’t go wrong with this. But it’s not spectacular and lack of swimming or natural shade that you don’t have to pay for are an issue. "
badhabbits05,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,"Nice and relaxing sunset drinks you will get hassled by locals selling kites, bracelets and all other items"
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,The beach in Seminyak is not as wide as in other areas of Bali but it is fairly clean and also perfect for a stroll. Compared to Kuta it is also cleaner. Not many people are in the water though.The best part are the sunsets which are simply stunning viewed from Seminyak. Best is to go to one of the beach clubs and enjoy the view from there.
BigMac666,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,Nice beach great for watching the sun set and to people watch. Very big surf comes in here also. Cold Bintangs from 20000IDR!
Ziggy N,"Nanaimo, Canada",May 2019,"The beach we accessed  in behind Discovery Mall. It goes for a long ways.  There are many vendors selling beverages and snacks tucked under the trees for shade. And of course the mall food court.  We had a wonderfully prepared Japanese meal. 2nd floor, other end of mall.  Over looks the street, Opposite KFC  The beach itself is not spotless. I have also seen much worse.  But if you going to be letting kids run around be sure to inspect as best you can for sharp items. There are designated areas for you to enter water.  Mind the yellow and read markers. There were very few people on this beach because it was so hot. Possibly on another day it would of been different.  This day was over 40 degrees and not a cloud in the sky"
Linda D,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2019,Great place to watch the sunset with your special friend.  Can sometimes be crowded during peak holiday periods. In the same vicinity of the beach are a couple of markets and really nice coffee shops. 
tryasanisca,2 contributions,Apr 2019,"My hotel was near the beach, so I went there and have a coconut to enjoy the sunset. It was fun so many people surfing and enjoy their time"
shirishnv,"Bengaluru, India",May 2019,"Our family of 4 stayed a week in April, just 10 mins walk from Seminyak Beach & visited it regularly. The beach is nice with beach restaurants playing 80’s music with plenty of beach chairs interspersed with 5 star hotels.  The beach itself was nice & empty as most of the tourists are on the beach chairs. It was really nice to walk on the beach in the early mornings & evenings too to watch the sunset or even to swim in the waves. The sand itself had a blackish hue with fine sand. The famous beach shack La Plancha is on this beach. "
Robyn W,"Fontana, CA",Apr 2019,"Seminyak is not a pretty beach, its dirty.Wild and stray dogs roam and bark at you. There is trash. Definitely not the highlight of my Bali trip. "
Amr77,"Alexandria, Egypt",May 2019,"The beach is huge. Shallow water, nice sand, strong waves. It’s a perfect beach for surfing & learning how to surf. There are a lot of places that teach you how to start surfing."

cavanabroad,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2019,Would not be back here. The sand is horrible to walk in. Spent about 20 mins here and left. Dog feaces all over the sand. Very bad smell of local waste
Ramsfan158,"Derby, UK",May 2019,"Beach covered in litter, litter in the water too, overpriced sun beds, hawkers.... try somewhere else"
Krossprocess,"Rowville, Australia",May 2019,Literally full of commercial rubbish! The live music venues at night are the only reason to visit this beach mainly because the beach gets raked and the rubbish is hidden in the dark. 
Paul in Frankfurt,"Frankfurt, Germany",May 2019,Pleasant but ... not my favorite... there’s open sewage and a fair amount of trash that washes up on the beach from god knows where? all sorts of PLASTIC trash is around and incredibly sad to witness. Why isn’t Bali aggressively working on picking up trash from its once pristine beaches? Non biodegradable PLASTIC shouldn’t just sit on the beach - it’s dirty and harmful to the environment. This is what happens when they’ve got 5 million visitors per year ... 
Ryan B,"Camps Bay, South Africa",Apr 2019,"When we went to visit my wife and i werent overly impressed. The beach had quite a bit of rubbish on it, the water was very murky and churned up from the big waves and it just didnt compare to other beaches i have been to around the world."
higgos@gmail.com,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2019,"Seminyak is that little bit quieter than Legian and definitely quieter than Kuta. Mostly high-end resorts so not a lot happening on the beachfront. Most of the resorts have restaurants/bars open to the public, including the excellent The Samaya, so it's well worth a drink or a meal looking over Seminyak Beach. Ok for surfing but the banks never quite form properly so it's hard to find a consistent peak. The quality of the water is hit and miss, use your sense. If it's been raining a lot and there's a lot of storm-water run-off or, (especially) you can see plastic bags, etc. in the water then stay out pf the water for a few days."
ExcitedTraveller1973,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Apr 2019,On our visits to Seminyak beach it was just out from our hotel - Royal Beach by MGallery. It was kept clean and the guys out front selling bintang and soft drinks were all good. Not as many hawkers selling items as other parts of the beach which has its good points!
Maria B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"We are not surfers, but real beach lovers - we would never consider sunbathing on this beach. The sea is quite rough, the beach itself is not very clean. Watching the sunset is the only reason to visit Seminyak beach in my opinion."
Sunshine307,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2019,Seminyak Beach is still one of the cleanest along here.Lots of beautiful cafes and restaurants to relax in and watch the waves or catch a breathtaking sunset while sipping on s cocktail. The beach is cleaned daily here so it is great to have a swim without all the litter👍
nxtxpxk,"Pattaya, Thailand",Apr 2019,The beach mainly attracts surfers. There are beach chairs everywhere where you can sit and grab some drinks from beach bars. Garbage can be seen in general.
JamesCowcher,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Go running, go for a swim , lie on the beach or drink beer at sunset. It’s all good. I was staying in the hotel indigo which has direct beach access and beach views from the hotel. I would recommend Seminyak over other beaches."
Astri F,6 contributions,Apr 2019,"I admire sunset in Seminyak Beach. This beach is not a quiet place to enjoy sunset while reading a book, but to catch a beautiful sunset? This is one of the must visit place.I love to see the wave and it sounds so calming. They provide many bean bag there, so you can choose any spot to catch the sunset. For some cafe they need you to make reservation before you come to get the best spot. But overall it was a great sunset.So, go catch your sunset in Seminyak Beach and enjoy the moment there."
1teaspoonlove®,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2018,Seminyak beach is definitely better then kuta Beach.It's closest if you are around seminyak.This beach is good for surfing for Children and people who are learning.Equipments are available there.Lots of good and beverage stalls around.
naziha m,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Apr 2019,I have seen many sunsets in my lifetime. But the ones I experienced on Seminyak Beach near The Champlung was simply breathtaking. How beautiful is His Creation.
ccteix2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Good because is a good area to stay in hotels ., but it has many bars and restaurants so, many people ... not clean enough but ok. "
Aldona D,Bemtota,Apr 2019,Beautiful beach with the big waves and gold sand. Waves are really very big and it is nice to observe them. People are surfing all the time and have a great fun doing it.It is also possible to have massage on the beach and drink fresh coconut.
merlin03,"Kenilworth, UK",Apr 2019,"The beach is too dangerous to swim in with currents being strong and it being red flagged as dangerous and life guards whistling you out.Raw sewage is pumped into the sea right next to the hotels Massive problem with rubbish, plastic bags and plastic bottles "
Wander265191,"Ubud, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Great for surfing but a little too strong for us to go further than paddle. Keep an eye on children! The tide can wash up a load of rubbish ☹️ but it is soon cleared up.
sudershan s,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Apr 2019,"This is a beautiful beach as good as beaches are. White sands lined with kiosks of seafood are inviting. The view of sunset is superb and a leisurely stroll along the beach is relaxing. I could not go into the water as it was full tide and I am afraid of being drowned. All the beaches are more or less, the same."
Ellen Brandt,"Chicago, IL",Apr 2019,"This is a great beach for adults, but it was a little crowded for us to take the kids, as we had some difficulty to keep an eye on them. You can buy delicious fruits and drinks from people on the beach, which is great way to cool off in the heat."
Argy39,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2019,We walked along here every morning on our recent stay and must say the beach is much cleaner now than it was 12 months ago and a real credit to the locals who make this happen.Lots happening on the beach with many bars and lounges available to have a drink. It can get a bit dangerous in the surf depending on how big it is. Not advised for poor swimmers.
Haldun D,"Istanbul Province, Turkey",Mar 2019,There is particulary very good place evening time . Getting snacks with beer and attending beatiful sunset. Due to tide more space at the beach.. 
Sharon D,7 contributions,Apr 2019,Beautiful beach. Walking with music playing. Had a swing on big swing. Easy walking. Cafes faced beach easy assess. 
Marion S,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Apr 2019,Excellent selection. All food ordered by our party of 8 was really delicious. Great cocktails. Good service. Will go again !!!!
Liane Chacra,21 contributions,Apr 2019,"This beach is fabulous as it is really the extension of Kuta beach and goes on for miles.  It is perfect to walking, but could be a bit of a challenge for swimming, as it is the place for surfing beginners.  This means that the waves arrive High and strong and that the beach is fairly flat which makes it safe for surfing.  If you would like to swim it may be a challenge as it is quite shallow and once you get past the waves, without a board you may be pulled under....not sure it did not try, but loved the walking, preferred to swim in our pool instead."
Okan T,3 contributions,Apr 2019,"I came here for surfing only and as such can only give a review based on that experience. However for the purposes stated above the Seminyak beach was great. A lot of white waves to take, though the currents can be strong. Great sandy beach. No annoying rocks. "
Marcus J,46 contributions,Apr 2019,Nice beach.  Short stroll from hotel. Nice views great vibes and atmosphere relaxing  with a. Cold beer 
FiverACT,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2019,"Not  bad beach, less busy than some of the Kuta and Legian beaches, and to us it was a more relaxed pace of visitor here too.A few of the reviews I've read spoke about the sand quality being better here? We didn't really notice that to be honest. I think we are spoilt with much better sand in Aus, but overall these are pretty great beaches."
Shanta,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2019,Less congested with better sand quality compared to Kuta n Legian which sit on the same stretch. The district itself is more relaxed n fun for food n shopping compared to the chaotic n very commercialised Kuta. 
Alexandra T,"Wollongong, Australia",Apr 2019,"This is my first visit to Bali and we are staying in Nusa Dua so we decided to venture out a bit and have a look at Seminyak- went to go for a walk on the beach and it’s definitely not the nicest beach to walk onTonnes of garbage everywhere! I don’t know how people could enjoy it, it makes me sad to see litter on the beach so I couldn’t stand it The amount of hotels along the beach, someone needs to take initiative and employ staff to keep the beach clean Definitely won’t be back for a swim at that beach "
NAC88,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,"I will not be going back to Seminyak again, the beach has been totally destroyed. It is covered in plastic trash and filth, which seems to pile up faster than the hotel workers can scoop it up. More concerning is the fact that the run off from the creek that flows into the Indian Ocean at the Pettitenget temple has basically turned into a sewage channel, with thousands of recently built villas discharging untreated sewage directly into the creek. It was raining off and on while I was there, and the ocean was brown and foamy with filth from the run off, and the beach smelly and gross. I was travelling with a few other families, and almost every single kid that went into the ocean got sick, several of them seriously enough to end up at the Bali clinic to get anti-biotics. One kid that was playing in the surf apparently got the brown water in his mouth and was vomiting for 2 days straight. I understand that the water is cleaner down by Double 6 beach and definitely up by Canggu, but frankly, until the local authorities get their act together and start cleaning up the water, I am not going back there for a beach holiday. Seminyak is a good place to go if you want to party in the bars, go shopping, go out to the many really cool restaurants and clubs in the area as long as you can tolerate long periods of time stuck in traffic. It is absolutely the wrong place to go if you want to go to the beach."
micheychris,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2019,"Our hotel was just 10 min walk down to Seminyak Beach.  Minus the vendors trying to sell you items, it’s a lovely walk/swim along the beach.  There are day beds you can hire.  A line of restaurants both casual and formal for a great view of the sunset.  The beach was clean."
Jim W,"Guam, Mariana Islands",Apr 2019,Waves are a bit rough for swimming but perfect for surfing and the Long Beach run  was absolute perfection.  But...the best part....the sunset.  Get a beach side table for dinner and enjoy the sunset over what I think is a top 10 beach in the world!  
Sashnson,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2019,"Amazing, great vibe, music on the beach, bean bags, great smells, awesome calm crowd. A great place to be at sunset. Eats, drinks and great chill out place."
Rbnwdln,Minnesota,Feb 2019,"We stayed at a beautiful resort in Seminyak and although the resort was fantastic, the beach and sea were quite dirty. The sand was grey with chunks of plastic and other debris. The water was also full of trash. Very disappointing to travel so far and find the beach in such condition.😔"
SClemens,"Livermore, CA",Apr 2019,Great beach at Double 6. Nice cafe and friendly people. We used the local surf school / board rental which was very fair. My wife like Seminyak over Samir.
Judy A,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2019,"Recently stayed at Double-Six Hotel and was able to see the daily early morning cleaning of the beach by tractor. Great beach for walking, scenic, lots of activity and some great beach restaurants and bars with bean bags to relax in and enjoy the music in the evenings. "
suzannecotton2711,"Leeds, UK",Mar 2019,sea can be a bit rough with large waves and a strong pull  good for surfing   the sea is really warm and clean . beach gets busy on night for the sun set but it is worth seeing.  plenty of bars and seating 
TKSG88,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2019,"Nice clean sand with nice sunset , nothing much to complain about , the corn being sold on the beach taste so good too "
Grace B,4 contributions,Mar 2019,do not buy and drink the cocktails as the will make u very sick.Its Bali moonshine they use.. it smells like fuel They told me its made from coconuts... no its not.It can be dangerous if ur on medication.The restaurants also offer these cocktails.Stay away from them. 
Anupam S,"Shimla, India",Mar 2019,This beach is a good place for strolling. Neat and clean beach. The weather was good in March when we visited there.overall a nice place for peaceful strolling.
asim_chakrabarti,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2019,"Excellent and clean beach..Surfing,  kiting and playing football with local inhabitants will add on extra mileage. "
Cbak748,"Brighton, Australia",Mar 2019,"The beach has brown sand and each morning there is brown scum in the waves and water and I was told it was rubbish. After a downpour of rain the water was littered with rubbish, plastic and other matter. It was awful and wrapped around your legs. I would not swim in it. At night The beach comes alive with beanbags and umbrellas with lights and music, which is very colourful, and turns into bars selling cocktails and beer and watch the sunset. Very pleasant."
cesaralonsogs,"Austin, TX",Mar 2019,"We spent most of our stay in Sanur, but we decided to spend one day in Seminyak. Overall, the beach seem to have a longer sand area than in Sanur with less algae. However, the water in Seminyak was not as calm as in Sanur making it more appropriate for surfing than for swimming. Also, Seminyak was not as peaceful as Sanur. It was definitely worth it to check it out though. "
Christine L,Waikanae,Oct 2018,I've seen a few reviews where the shore has been described as dirty but I found it fine when visiting in October 2018............the sunsets were beautiful - nice long walk along the beach a few days - could stop and hire a lounger for next to nothing along with bottled water if needed.    Crowded at sunset along Kuta area but in Seminyak there were less people.
Aaqarsh Aiyyar,"Chennai (Madras), India",Mar 2019,"Though the shores were dirty, the water was clean. I loved watching the sunset at this beach. The beach was crowded and there were quite a few shops and vendors who were busy taking care of their business. "
The travelling PUNter,"London, UK",Mar 2019,Not what I expected when coming to one of Bali’s nicest beaches - lots of rubbish and people not a very serene place...
SabrinaCCSP,"Makati, Metro Manila, Luzon",Nov 2018,"locals should be responsible in cleaning the area not just taking care of their business, but also taking care of our nature which help them to earn money for living also tourist need to learn how respect the place and not just throw your trash anywhere. be responsible traveler guys."
pjacw,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"Although this beach is nicer than the beach in Kuta which has litter everywhere, it's hardly clean and I definitely wouldn't describe it as a beautiful beach with white sand as it is often advertised. The water is quite shallow and the beach is wider than many. I wouldn't stay in Seminyak if I was after a beach holiday, but it's ok for a day maybe. Uluwatu is a better place to stay if you want a nice beach holiday."
Lucifer,34 contributions,Jul 2018,"Went to the beach late afternoon for drink and to watch the sunset,very busy lots of people and vendors selling scarves necklaces etc. Nice atmosphere but was told not to order any cocktails as several people had previously encountered stomach problems as a result.Beer soft drinks anything with a screw cap I thought would be fine and so it was.Would recommend it."
leanneandtony,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2019,The beach is fine. The further north u head the less hawkers and people on the beach. There are still chairs and umbrellas to hire and cheap beers to buy
Yagneshchandan,"Pune, India",Feb 2019,Seminyak beach is not much crowded. Its a clean beach where you can relax and also play in water. Good resorts and hotels nearby to stay.
nealeconnor,"Wokingham, UK",Mar 2019,Stunning beach.  Sea was lovely and warm and quite shallow in places which was ideal  for my wife . You don’t get pestered much by locals trying to sell you stuff and plenty of beach bars for food and drink .
Emvestment,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2019,"This is the place where to start surfing. Suitable Wave (not big not small). The feeling when you stand on the surf also on the surface of the wave, is amazing. RECOMMEND :1. You can find the Surf Lesson at the beach (Cheaper but only teacher no Photographers) or the Professional Surf School with teacher and photographers) by internet (school is near the beach by 10-15 min walk.2. For beginner, the more big board the more easy to stand.  "
dans8448,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"When coming here we weren’t expecting this beach to be the most stunning in the world but what we did find shocked us! Although the beach is big, with lovely dark sand and big waves it is in desperate need of some environmental action! The plastic and rubbish towards the top of this beach is quite shocking and sad to see! It is clear from visiting Bali that over population and the massive tourist numbers are having a huge impact on the environment here, and it isn’t hidden away. On the plus, the beach has an abundance of cafes and bars if your looking for lunch or a drink, and it’s a good beach for a long stroll. The sunsets here are very pretty too. Not for me and I really hope the Indonesian government starts paying attention to their pollution problems!"
Tani M,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2019,"I havent gone for swimming there, but have gone for a walk, sat in one of the many beach side cafes andenjoued a drink along with music and sunset. It will be an enjoyable evening. There will be sellers coming up to you, just say no thank you firmly if you dont wanna buy."
Steven C,Eugene,Feb 2019,"Lots going on, many facilities for food, drinks, and activities. Easy to stroll most areas with some quiet spots and some very active. A great mix."
thomas blaire,"Spain, El Centenillo, Spain",Jan 2019,"we visited this place when sunset time, sunset looks really good from this beach, the beach is also clean, hope to visit this place again"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Mar 2019,"Typical Bali beach really , can get rough and you need to watch the tides for reps etc.Always plenty of activity happening along with plenty of bars and restaurants."
Wayne L,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2019,"Our hotel faced the beach in Seminyak, the beach can be walked on for many ks either way , i e from the airport beach to Changu and looks like one is in paradise.Sand is black , a change to what most of us are used to , surf is spectacular , but dangerous to the inexperienced swimmers.Unfortunately like most beaches in Bali , there is a massive problem with litter and rubbish , the main culprit being plastic of all descriptions , both in the water and on the beach.We encourage people visiting the beach to bring back a plastic bag full of rubbish each time they visit to not only assist with the litter problem , but also to encouragr locals to clean their beaches for themselves and the environment (N B we are not Greenies )"
paulraw12,"London, UK",Feb 2019,"Safe, lovely and with water that is a pleasure to go in to.You can surf though the waves were quiet when we were therePeople are always cleaning up rubbish"
Jacinta M,34 contributions,Mar 2019,"Truly the best sunsets in Bali,find yourself a wonderful restaurant or just laze on the beanbags with a drink or two and watch the sun go down "
Kumar E,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"Beautiful beach to watch the sunset and chill out. You will fins many restaurants, and along the beach side. I enjoyed sipping a cocktail and watching the sun goes down. So relaxing."
Caroline H,"Alstonville, Australia",Mar 2019,😎.....was a nice place to see 🏖Preferred my private pool and less tourists to be honest 😊😎😍Quiet time was all I was in need of for this trip away ☺☺☺☺☺
Craig F,16 contributions,Feb 2019,"I understand February is offseason in Bali, however, the weather was nice, surf was up, not too many people on the beach or in the water.  Always lots of available sun lounges with umbrellas.  Only complaint is the very gradual slope of the beach, so you have to go WAY out to be in water above waist level.  Actually, one other complaint and its a big one, the people coming up to you every 5 minutes trying to sell you something.  Just want to close my eyes and chill, right?  Very annoying. Oh yeah, one more thing...walked to the beach from Potato Head and on the way walked through a river of sewer water flowing into the ocean.  Yuk.   But don't think that's super close to the public beach, was hard to tell at night.  Anyway, also have fresh coconut water for sale and showers for use for a small fee.  Great beach overall"
Bas F,"Roosendaal, The Netherlands",Mar 2019,It is a beautifull beach with nice sands and relatively calm des. Many possibillities to enjoy a longer stay here.Drinks and bites available.
Rodney M,"St Peters, Australia",Feb 2019,"The beach is always fun to walk along , I find it best early in the morning or later in the afternoon as it does get very hot .It’s a surf beach so be prepared for some strong waves or currents and swim where the flags are.There is many spots you can hire chairs or just stop for a cool drink , there are a lot of  Balinese selling sarongs jewellery etc but if you take the time talk to them they do have interesting stories to share .You also are able to grab a massage along the beach and there is no shortage of food . I find the best way to walk down to Legion or Kuta as it does not seem as far compared to walking the main streets.When the tide is out there is some rubbish that you will see and the locals try to clean the beach up as much as possible ."
VWDest,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Feb 2019,"Seminyak beach is a okey beach with a lot of nice restaurants and surfing spots and companies renting you surfing gear, but the beach feels a bit dirty..Not so much the beach actually more the plastic coming up on shore..Everyday I cleaned plastic coming up from the ocean.It’s so sad what we the human race are doing to our planet."
Olga K,"Moscow, Russia",Feb 2019,"Hello everyone!I want to tell you about Seminyak beach and places I visited near this beach.First of all , Seminyak beach is one of the cleanest beaches but it is not possible to swim there because of waves. For swimminf I like Karma beach or Melasti beach next to Karma. On the Seminyak you can go to Potato Beach Club and have fun there all day from 10am to 1am. Deposit is 1 million for bed. Maximum 6 persons. You can get drinks and food for these money. At night I went to ""Mirror"" night club and ""La Favela"". i liked them and I really had fun there. Night clubs normally close at 3pm there.Enjoy your holidays!Yours Olga Korneva ;)"
Int_Academic,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2019,I've visited the beach many times. The first time I saw masses of plastic particles on the tide line where you might expect to see shells and seaweed.This time perhaps because it coincided with Chinese New Year the beach seemed pristine.  It was clear that this was due to a concerted effort to rake and collect the plastic. Full marks hotels / council i cant express how important this aspect is to visitors. And thank you for the beautification of the roadside with plants. It has made a massive difference.
Jonas W,"Stockholm, Sweden",Mar 2019,"Beach is unfortunately not so nice anymore, lots of plastic and stuff. Surfing is ok still, but the beach is not for swimming due to waves and currents. Beach side hotels and restaurants are not especially nice either; more pricey the just a block above and the value for the extra sea view is overrated. Better beaches just north of.We had one stop there and never went back. "
Aj92,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"Very average beach, thank goodness i don't see much rubbish after i heard there was a ban for single use plastic. It's nice to see the sunset there if you like walks on the beach and have some cocktails in the bars there. Watch out for some dogs that poop in some parts of the beach. Other than that it's good to go early in the morning there as well. If you are going by a motorcycle or car there is parking fee which is about 500 rp."
chrisCullercots,cullercots,Feb 2019,"Really got a shock when visited the beach. Dirty, packs of dogs and sh..... all over the beach, plastic, rubbish, brown sea with rubbish off the plastic, beach bars expensive."
Sunshine619277,"North Shields, Australia",Feb 2019,"Book a restaurant overlooking the beach at sunset... beautiful Italian food at La Lucciola - gentleman need a t shirt, no singlets allowed even nice ones..."
Alex V,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Feb 2019,Great place for sunset view and drink in the beachbars. The beach also good for the middle range surfers.
palanivelan,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Feb 2019,"Not much impressed with this beach, very average and some those in Vietnam or Malaysia definitely will be better choice"
Lynette F,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2018,"A national tragedy to see the mountains of rubbish washing up on to this iconic beach, as tourists lounged on rented beach chairs. What a mess. At each of the big beachfront venues, workers were hopelessly attempting to clear away the relentless pollution. On 25 Dec 2018 the Mayor announced he was banning single use plastics - they are thrown in to rivers by villagers then washed into the ocean during the rainy seasons. "
flipper0211,"Miami Shores, FL",Feb 2019,"The beach area is spacious, theres plenty of restaurant and food stalls along the walkway. The sand is soft and the water was clean. Plenty of good waves for a surfer to enjoy. Good place to spend a few hours."
Eunyoung C,"Seoul, South Korea",Feb 2019,I went to Seminyark beach to see a Sunset. The Sunset was so beautiful and fantastic.I stayed on the beach for four hours.It was an atmosphere of calm and restifulnes.
Aura_Bold,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Very beautiful when the sun goes down. We really enjoy relaxing time on the beach while jogging in the afternoon.
Pepper,"Seattle, WA",Feb 2019,"Huge Beach at low tide. Great for walking. Lots of nightlife but also some easy, quiet areas.  Great places to eat all along the way. Some good beach restaurants - high romance - but some of the places have blaring music. "
shreyashrivastav27,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Feb 2019,"It’s a beautiful beach with some great food options around it. Potato beach house club, woo bar, sky garden. Upscale boutiques and restaurants. Semniyak beach is good for relaxing, swimming and enjoy good night life "
lorra209,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"We visited a few different beaches during our stay in Bali and were very upset and the amount of rubbish and debris lying around. We took a cab to Seminyak Beach and could immediately see a huge difference from the other beaches. We could tell that a tractor had been over the beach before our arrival. There was the usual umbrella and deck chair crews at the beach and we were able negotiate down from the 200000 IDR quoted to 150000 IDR. The beach was not very crowded. There were the usual peddlers walking up and down the beach and for the most part were respectful if you decided not to purchase. A few were a bit more zealous than the others, but overall a simple no thanks was usually enough. The thing that impressed me the most was at the high tide time, the umbrella traders and their crews came down to the water's edge and raked and removed any rubbish on the beach and then took it away and placed it in a bin. (We had seen a crew on another beach, rake up the beach but then just dig an hole and bury it). It took them only about 10 minutes and small crews were doing it all the way up the beach. The restaurants in the area were a little more expensive than other areas, but still good value in comparison to aussie prices."
David M,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"Such potential for this to be an amazing beach. Instead it’s full of trash, looked abandoned and neglected. It’s strange that the hotels and resorts along the shore don’t cash in on, and look after the beach in front of them. "
Saurav M,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2019,"Just dirty, plain and simple. Sad beach! Nothing more to say, dogs and their owners roaming around, stupid pictures and no shacks! All high end beach restaurants ready to rob u! "
Gibbo1969,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2019,"First time in Seminyak and had high expectations. To be honest we were disappointed, beachfront is dominated by big resorts so there is no beach walk as such . Town has a lot of paddy fields in it so the mozzies were off the charts .Usual mix of good, bad and ugly places to eat but didn’t love it and will go back to sanur next time"
Adrianfgs,"Shanghai Region, China",Feb 2019,"Seminyak beach is beautiful and the views, especially at sunset, are delightful. However, it’s best just to admire the views rather than venture into the water, as the sea is littered with rubbish/garbage, which is a massive disappointment! "
Jay S,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2019,"Yes plastics and pollution is an issue. We all know that. We all make our own choices. I was pleasantly surprised when I visited this beach. Long and wide, not overly crowded. Didn’t see much pollution. Enjoyed the sights and sounds. I’d say this is a must check out"
Jackie A,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,Not suited for swimming due to amount of debris that washes up. Maybe due to time of year. Lovely restaurants along the beachfront area though for sunset if able to overlook the debris
ekapryadi,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,at seminyak beach you can seeing sunset for free or you can drink at la planca once of most pupular cafe in front the beach..
lgcnz123,9 contributions,Feb 2019,"Very beautiful beach amazing bars to sit down and relax at such a great experience. Only downside is the poo, condoms and rubbish that lines the beach where water meets the sand."
Fil Magnoli,4 contributions,Feb 2019,"The local authorities need to do a better job at cleaning up the beach. The water is warm, the beaches are groomed by tractors every morning, but the amount of plastic waste washing up is ongoing. Local beach businesses, wether it’s chair/umbrella, surf lessons or other Independant rental operators do their best to pitch in throughout the day, but it’s a bigger problem that needs a relook at how we as a society treat and use products. Good on Bali for eliminating plastic bags from many shops this year, hopefully it has a positive impact on what would otherwise be a lovely day out to the beach."
rene z,"Tamarindo, Costa Rica",Feb 2019,We went for a beach walk at 6:30am and the amount of garbage on the beach was appalling. Cleaning crews were working but it’s sad to see so much plastic and other types of garbage on the beach. With so much income crom tourism the Balinese government ought to invest in educating people about littering...
T D N,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"This beach is quaint and simple (and a little bit stinky). Don’t expect much and you’ll enjoy it. It’s a beautiful walk to La Plancha or similar, yet it’s so heartbreakingly covered in rubbish and debris. "
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"Hotels offering Western style comfort, restaurants with a bit of everything, disco's with loud bass sounds and amplifiers on the beach (hard rock, hiphop, disco, Beatles and Stones from the 1960s). Lots of cold beer. Not to mention vendors and other local service providers. Great for watching sunsets and having a party.Quite unique are the big waves, but they also carry a lot of rubbish to the beach. A result of a poor waste collection system on the island and of course large industries that wrap their goods in plastic. 80% of the garbage on Seminyak beach comes from rivers that wash it down into the ocean. Especially during the rainy season it is a big problem."
Kyla L,11 contributions,Feb 2019,"An average looking beach that is made to look much worse because of all the garbage washed ashore. They going rate for sun chairs seems to be 200K for two people, which is way more than other places and you don’t even get access to food or toilets! Would never come back. "
TheMoni17,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2019,It is a nice soft white sand beach with many restaurants and shacks lined up on the edges. We went there for a stroll with our footwears in our hands but had to be very careful while walking as there was too much waste & garbage being thrown at this beach. I think Bali government should limit the commercialisation here and make strict rules for the vendors and sellers to ensure that their customers do not litter. And should also impose fine on the people/visitors who litter. 
Ferry A,"San Mateo, Philippines",Feb 2019,We went there for dinner. Relaxing and colorful bean chairs all over. Went to a resto with live singers. Friendly staff. We loved their pizza and chicken wings. A variety of drinks too. 
janetlim18,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jul 2018,"Nice beach, worth to go. Will go again. Was great for time lapse video and beach walk. Enjoyed my time there with sunset. "
HayleyPresling,"Wellington, New Zealand",Feb 2019,Beautiful setting on Bali’s coastline. But sadly there is a lot of rubbish left behind which impacts the beauty. Be weary of the people trying to give you cards for timeshares and trying to get you to go to the hotels with them to claim prizes. This got annoying as there are so many people doing the same thing and some are quite pushy. We walked along the beach once but didn’t return again.
Ciggie123,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2019,We are staying right on the beach which is lovely just to look at but too rough for swimming most days.  Sand is awful 
Margaret B,"Calgary, Canada",Jan 2019,"At first glance upon arrival walking the beaches from Seminyak to Legian and Kuta and back my reaction was “are you kidding me”. The words that comes to mind were SAD, PATHETIC, A TRAGEDY! In our travels, this is the filthiest beach we ever visited. There were a number of surfers taking lessons and others swimming. If I had children there is no way I would allow them to swim in those waters.  The first couple weeks the beaches were much the same, some days much worse than others. There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions. Sometimes we can be too quick to judge a place. Sadly for some we met, they only had a few days or a week to visit it at it’s worse."
paul,10 contributions,Feb 2019,Easy access. Lots of seating at bars and restos. Nice for family visits.  Not too noisy and lots of different price offering. 
WarneAu,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,Nice place to spend an evening with good restaurants to choose from and  listen to live music. Clean beach area. Don’t know how safe to swim. 
Brage N,9 contributions,Feb 2019,"Granted, the weather was bad, but the beach wasn't great.  The sand is dark brown and there are some stray dogs there."
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2019,Visited during my long walk along the coastal beaches of Kuta area. This beach was a bit cleaner than the previous ones but still had plenty of plastic around. Nice area and plenty of places to view sunset in the afternoon.
Leslie L,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,The amount of plastic washed up on shore is horrific. Apparently Indonesia is second only to China for plastic pollution in our oceans. Such a shame.
CharisseThompson,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Dec 2018,"It’s always refreshing to be at the beach. Great surfing waves, clear water, and warm sand between your toes."
Selena D,"Manchester, UK",Dec 2018,Every morning the locals clean this beach before the tourists get there because it is full off pollutions that comes in from the ocean. It’s a nice enough beach (after the clean up) but there are better beaches such as Echo beach and Nusa Beach. This beach is perfect for watching the sunset though!
davolitribe,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,"So much rubbish floating in the water........water is beautiful and warm and the atmosphere great, but it's all let down by the floating rubbish and debris in the ocean. Something needs to be done......"
Noelene G,"Epping, Australia",Jan 2019,Nice sunset......but beach was full of rubbish.  Was not nice seeing a man drown and all the tourist just taking pictures.
John and Les C,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Jan 2019,We were in Seminyak in early/mid January 2019 and saw some great sunsets.  Nice to walk along the beach during the day and visit Ku Da Ta and Potatoe Head.
Sammimitch6,"Haltwhistle, UK",Jan 2019,"Wow what an amazing huge beach which goes on forever. You'll certainly not feel overcrowded on this beach! Great for surfing to & lots of bars & restaurants nearby. It was a shame to see lots of plastic lying around on it but there was people there every day trying to pick it up, such a shame our world has let this happen, well done for trying to keep on top of it."
Sue T,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2019,A great place to sit with a glass of wine to watch the beautiful sunset.  Lots of locals will come up and try to sell their wares but they are making a living so I didn’t find it a problem. Lots of bats on the beach to buy beer. We brought our own wine.
Alexey Ivanov,"Moscow, Russia",Jan 2019,"Been here many times, great sunset many nice cafes along the beach, great place for cocktails and meet up with friends"
Marynik2,"Bathurst, Australia",Jan 2019,"We went for a walk along the beach and it was considerably cleaner than other Bali beaches( Sanur, legion, kuta)I would probably go for a swim too as the water wasn’t washing up piles of plastic! The beach out the more expensive resorts( legian , oberoi) was pretty much spotless and we only encountered less than half a dozen hawkers along the way. Obviously they pay to keep them at bay. "
Bettina W,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jan 2019,We spent one night in Seminyak and went to check the beach in the morning... we were very disappointed! The water is so dirty that we did not go in...there are great hotels on the beach and waves for surfers but unfortunately the water is dirty and the beach is not that great. There are many better options in Bali
Karen G,Tauranga,Jan 2019,"What a shame that what could be a great beach is filthy. Rubbish everywhere and the main entry smell disgusting. The beach is long and pretty is it went for this. Tourist will be more and more turned of visiting if the local population don't start to take a pride in where they live.  There was no one renting sun loungers, why would you to look at rubbishing washing in and out on the beach. There were a lot of surfers so I assume that's the main draw, however there are red flags lining most of the beach indicating rips and unsafe swimming areas. We only visited once preferring to swim in our villa pool instead."
CapeTurning,"Iisalmi, Finland",Dec 2018,"(written after 1st day, update after that)After starting our Bali trip in Sanur, where the beach was clean, with zero plastic and crystal, still waters, the Seminyak beach DUMP was a shocking experience!A very nice, classic monumental beach, tens of kilometres long, and more than 50 m wide, with this solid, easy-walking sand, BUT FULL OF PLASTIC! Both the beach and the water as well. And small rivers bring sewage, nauseous.Could not swim at all, so ugly! Fortunately we had such a nice villa, we could stay there.About this disaster we discussed for long with our villa manager. Well, he said that the beach is not such all the time, but twice a year. Then there is certain wind, that now started blowin 4 days ago, and it brings a lot of wood pieces and plastic ashore.Usually lasts around a week. Good thing to see, compared to eg. Thailand, was to see, that there was an army of government paid workers cleaning beach, and trucks driving the waste away. On our 1 hour walk I think we saw more than hundred workers on a 2km strip of beach.Still, it will last days for the sea to vommit all the carbage to the land for them to pick up.I asked where is the litter from, and the manager told us, it is from ther rivers, namely Balis own rivers, not coming further away. He said there is a lot going on in Bali to tackle the issue, but the change is slow, and presumed it take at least one lifetime. They do realize that tourists won't come if it is not clean!And, maybe tourists have already started to shun Bali as both in Sanur and in Seminyak it was really quite, the restaurants empty all night etc.?They are banning the plastic straws already, which is a start, but most of the plastic litter seems to be smaller than plastic bags, these everyday wrappers for food. Why do we need to wrap a single sweet into plastic?(updated after the second last day)Well, during the last day, the beach seemed cleaner, the armies of cleaners had succeeded and it seemed less new trash coming. However, when standing in the sea knee deep, almost every wave brouht ugly things to skin...(updated after the last day)The situation got even better, less crap. A New Hope!#hopingforthebetterworld #stoptheplasticpollution"

JasonD1972,"Canberra, Australia",Dec 2018,sewage and rubbish everywhere. walked down to the beach once and never returned. watched a couple wash the sand of their feet in one of the open drains running onto the beach. wtf? :-D
David C,4 contributions,Jan 2019,"Safe to swim around others, but sand to get to the beach very hot and debree floting in the white wash."
Stephan S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Dec 2018,"Visited here x2 during our stay, sun loungers readily available and the accompanying service cannot be faulted, you run a bit of a gauntlet as you arrive ( multiple vendors asking you to stay on “their “ loungers” when walking was disappointing to see the amount of plastic still even though there has been a push to reduce usage of plastic bags."
Barry M,Siem Reap,Jan 2019,"We’re here for a week and wishing we’d researched more thoroughly before booking a villaThe beach is a tip. It’s strewn with litter, especially plastic. Some hotels make a half hearted effort to clean up the patch outside their property but it’s token. We took some pics outside the Oberoi, Legian, Ku de Ta. Judge for yourself Worse from a health point of view is the stinking effluent that drains across the beach in several places. A beach stroll means having to walk or wade through untreated sewage.And people actually swim and lay down among this sh:t. Yuk. "
Rian L,15 contributions,Jan 2019,We spent the day at the beach and what a nice place not to crowded and very pleasant. Water was very enjoyable and will definitely go there again.
CiaraG,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2018,"Seminyak Beach is a good place to see the sunset, but cannot particularly recommend it for tourists during the day. The beach is full of piles of rubbish, & there is (as pictured below) rubbish in the ocean & washing up on the foreshore. Definitely wouldn't recommend for swimming, or water activities of any kind! If you're looking for swimming beach, head down to Nusa Dua 🏖️ It can be nice to walk along the beach (if you're that kind of person), & there was a swing set up down there during our visit (Dec 18) for tourists to take pictures with. There are a good number of beach bars around with pools, however these get unbelievably busy & we couldn't even find a place to be served. Overall, a good place to see the sunset, but I'd give the typical beach activities a miss! 🌇"
Bhavicp,"Fiumicino, Italy",Jan 2019,"Decently clean beach and quite big. Sand is very very soft (black sand)Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach with pretty good prices for drinks and food.  Around 100k for a cocktail and 80k for chicken Nachos- sitting on the beach on bean bags and live music at night. Didn't seem to be any bugs either, even at 9pm. Must go here for a lovely sunset experience  "
wendy c,barcelona,Dec 2018,"We stayed in Seminyak for 2 weeks during Christmas and New Year. We’ve been coming to Bali for 24 years but always staying in Bali Hyatt in Sanur then to Grand Hyatt in Nusa Dua. This time though, we decided to rent a villa in Seminyak, 5 minutes walk from Ku De Ta.On our first day, I ran on the beach. It was DISGUSTING! I saw dogs pooing on the beach, pile  of rubbish so high I thought from afar that  they are piling it for new year’s bonfire until I got close to it and it was a pile of rubbish. I ran for 5 km and it was just horrifying.  I’ve never seen this part of Bali and I feel so sad that such beach condition exists.Also the pack of dogs that are present along the beach can be very intimidating and very aggressive. Parents especially with small children, Beware!"
haqsta,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,"Please see review of Double Six Beach where essentially say beach is wide and great for walking yet feels a bit dirty with the occasional whiff of sewage. That said (!) it is a very nice walk past all the beach bars at sunset from Double Six right up to La Lucciola The W, Alila and all the great Beach bars around that part. Quite a social walking vibe at sunset"
Teo,Petaling Jaya,Jan 2019,Be sure to come here when you are in Seminyak. It is just within walking distance or you can ride a bike to here. The sunset is picturesque. 
wayne j,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,Last time we were in Seminyak was in 2008 and what a difference ten years make! Could not believe the amount of rubbish on the beach and also what was coming in on the tide! Go for a surf or swim here? No way! Stop consuming people and take care of your rubbish!
Luciana M,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jan 2019,"I was very disapointed! It was the First place I visited in Bali, the beach is dirty, there is garbage everywhere. The beach is not beautiful, I stayed 4 nights in Seminyak, I wouldnt stay there again, I would go to Canggu or Uluwatu in instead"
Freedom820908,"Sun Valley, South Africa",Jan 2019,Good service and good food. nice selection on the menu with a modern twist.Very popular and nice location.
Vincent L,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Dec 2018,"They  do spend a lot of time and money cleaning up  the plastic,driftwood  and other  debris every low tide. Seeing  all the debris debris every morning I can't imagine it being very inviting for swimmers. Fortunately the resorts along the beach have pools."
Jazy1,"London, UK",Dec 2018,"I found the beach unclean.  I’m use to white sands the whole nine yards.  I can’t compare it to the Caribbean of course. I do think there needs to be more effort to maintain it.  Definitely the most expensive beach I have been to just to hire a beach chair, more so than Jamaica negril believe it or not. Roughly £12 for less than 4 hours. Ludicrous."
Daisy C,"Penryn, UK",Jan 2019,A nice beach for a walk or to watch the sunset. Plenty of sun beds to rent and beach clubs to visit. 
E R N,42 contributions,Jan 2019,"Beach is nice - Less popular than Kuta Beach, but same great waves. - if you like to run, there is a good path that has no stop lights. Easily do a 10km loop. "
Chris H,"Barnsley, UK",Jan 2019,"If the problem of plastics in the sea is not on your radar, come to this beach! The beach looks great, wide with golden sand, but loads of plastic being washed in. This isn't Bali's problem, it is everybodies. Such a shame."
Deanne D,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2019,Nice beach. Be careful where you walk though as there is a large amount of plastic getting washed up onto the beach. This is very sad as apart from that it is very pretty. You can walk along the beach for a long way. There are touts selling all sorts of things on the beach too. Be sure to swim between the flags as there are dangerous bits.
"Theo Botha-chef,restauranteur,hotelier",301 contributions,Jan 2019,"Nice beach to learn how to surf.Its a natural black sand or volcanic sand beach.Problem is,there is just so much rubbish all over the beach.It really spoils the feel and natural beauty of the shoreline .You can rent a surfboard for 50k for 1 hour .more expensive than eco beach where you can get it for 2 hours.Rent sun-beds  for 100k an hour.Loads of bars on the beach to have a cocktail or beer.Kids loved it there.The local ladies sell their chicken skewers on the street.you have to try them.delicious!"

ekta s,"Chennai (Madras), India",Aug 2018,"If you are on Bali visit then Seminyak and Ubud should be in your bucket list and this beach is one of the ""go to"" places of Seminyak.The cafes and restaurants are always busy around these areas and are open for a quite a long time at night so this is one of the places to visit to get a feel of Bali night life.The beach itself might be crowded and not very clean as it's quite popular beach here. "
Jared F,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Dec 2018,"Went to the beach, as it was very hot in Bali only to find that the water was cloudy and had many items floating in it."
Kathyboddy,"Derby, UK",Jan 2019,"It was a vile and shocking experience to walk along the beach and water’s edge, and virtually impossible to avoid the huge amount of plastics, debris and rubbish littering miles of the coastline. Adding to this was the awful smell from the rivers of Seminyak where they crossed the beach. So sad. "
Darren P,MANCHESTER,Dec 2018,"Dirty beach, not great for swimming as lots of debris washing into the sea after rainfall inland. Lots of discarded nappies to walk around on the sand, cleaners were at work but I feel more should be done."
cterrantroy,"Chatswood, Australia",Jan 2019,There are numerous bars that put beanbags out at around 5pn and set up for a DJ or live duo band. It's great to drink and eat with the sun set over the horizon. We do this as a ritual everytime we are here.
Andy From Aus,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"Just like most of the popular beaches in Bali the Seminyak beach is filthy, dirty and downright disgusting. "
Fearless720056,"Bury St. Edmunds, UK",Jan 2019,"I was amazed at the amount of rubbish on this beach I have never seen such a dirty beach, when going knee deep in the sea you get plastic bags wrapped around your legs. This beach seriously needs to be rescued and given a clean up. "
Andrew K,11 contributions,Jan 2019,Very dirty would not swim storm water drains do straight in water a stroll through the local tip is cleaner. 
David T,"London, UK",Jan 2019,"Amazing, long beach, really good for a long wander and perfect place to see an amazing sunset in Bali.During the build up to New Year’s Eve there was a lot more ‘chavvy’ guests arriving and the vibe changed a bit from chilled out place to party party party!! Would deffo recommend still!"
Anton R,"Tumbi Umbi, Australia",Jan 2019,"The beach is huge - lots of nice places to chill - but unfortunately very polluted with plastic and other rubbish. They are cleaning the upper section of the beach, but right at the water’s edge and in the surf is a polluted mess. "
Derek B,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Jan 2019,"Don't plan on beautiful beaches here,     unfortunately sewage and rubbish is out of control.       Sad to see what we are doing to this planet "
Dawsay,"Leeds, UK",Dec 2018,A lovely beach with some beautiful views at sunset. This was our second time there in 2 years but it’s really gone done hill. We had one big concern with waste and plastic which seems to be an issue with it being washed up.The larger hotel groups should combine to fund a team to walk up and down it daily (perhaps first thing in the morning at sun rise) lifting the waste. Not only would it creat employment within Indonesia it would greatly improve the negative declining image of the beach.
aeroguy65,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Dec 2018,"It’s sad to see the beach being littered with rubbish! A lot of trash are being thrown on the beach itself. The last time I visited the beach was about 5 years ago and it wasn’t that bad. I guess with the influx of tourist the beach is now suffering the consequences. The sunset view is amazing, you just need to look up and bypass all the dirt on the beach itself."
manosk1,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Where is this coming from??? Just go close to Mano club restaurant and judge for yourself..The washed out garbage by the currents will still bother you but a lot less..Legian, Samaya, Seminyak beach and other top notch resorts doing a great job to clean the litter,But the smell from the flowing waters direction from the city to the sea is just unbearable. Seminyak beach is wonderful to walk up and down and the sunset is stunning. However, better use the pool of your hotel for a dive...If you’re still brave enough and want to swim or surf the beautiful waves, better be vaccinated and I’m not kidding at all.I’m residing in Asia Pacific and travel to Bali four times per year (I love the place and the people tourist scammers included as by now I know how to protect myself), I’ve reported the issue couple of times to the local authorities and as usual, hope dies last..Happy 2019, guys!"

Magnus,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2018,The beach have plenty of good restaurants and you can rent umbrellas! But it’s really depressing that the beach is full of plastic. Especially in the morning before the daily cleaning team has been there.
nicethingsinlife,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2018,"For a destination that heavily relies on the beauty of its environment to attract visitors, it's heart-breaking to see the constant piles of rubbish that wash ashore each day.  Despite the daily cleanups that are done by some businesses, the supply of trash seems endless.  This is not what tourists come for but how must it be for the people of Bali? They have to see and live in this everyday.  On land, waste management is pretty inefficient.  This is a complicated problem that requires many different groups doing their part.  Restaurants seem to be adopting some operational changes (like using compostable straws) but much, much more needs to be done here."
Miken2603,"Abergavenny, UK",Dec 2018,The beach is sandy and generally clean but the water does contain a small amount of plastics/rubbish. The water is shallow but quite big and powerful waves start breaking about 30m off-shore. There is an undertow but I only got concerned in stormy weather. Good for body-boarding and learning to surf. . There is a surf school at the beach.
Dee,9 contributions,Dec 2018,the restaurants was amazing on the beach with sand in your toes...   Had Christmas lunch there . stunning 
Bittesegen,"Hua Hin, Thailand",Dec 2018,"The Seminyak beaches have not been this full of trash ever before, you do not want to swim with plastic and walk on trash and needles. Take charge of your beaches "
spensterr,"Fort Collins, CO",Dec 2018,Nice beach that isnt over run with locals trying to sell you junk or a quick massage. Much different then Kuta beach in that sense. Good breaks for those surfing and great views for those just catching the sunset.
rameshkanesan,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"Its a great beach, however needs to get rid of the rubbish. They have to place bins at the beach as it is not safe. Broken glasses and plastic. Bali is cutting down 70% of plastic waste. Pls start with the beaches...because its still a great beach."
Ana,"Shinjuku, Japan",Dec 2018,"Dirty, yes, but the locals seem to be doing their best to clean up. I hope the tourists would do their part as well.Also, no swimming allowed except for a small area... although surfers also occupy that part too, so I guess it's not for people who just want to get in the water."
Marj B,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"So we were excited to enter the entrance gate to the beach ready to swim. We saw the nice beach bars and wanted to watch the sunset but was turned off by the smelly sewerage water flowing onto the beach. We wanted to go right towards potato beach head club but couldn’t cross due to the sewerage water, disgusting.Dogs were around as well as their poop.Shame it could be really one of the best beaches."

Hiyas,Atlanta,Dec 2018,"Frankly disgusting.As some reviews have mentioned, the beach is a litter box . We saw stray dogs pooping on the beach and one dog with owner just covered his dog's poop with sand. Yikes! Some unleashed dogs are also aggressive and start barking at passersby.

Douglas G,"Isle of Portland, UK",Nov 2018,"There is a point where you can get onto the beach without going through one of the many hotels that dominate the beachfront.  Head for Seminyak hotel and there is a point where there is a large scooter park and some limited off-road car parking.  Walk through the gateway onto the beach.  There are lots of sun beds in both directions with large sun umbrellas presumably for a charge.  I wanted a long walk and turned right( north) to head past a few of the other hotels that all front onto the beach.  They all look good hotels.  A few beach vendors but not too annoying! Very long shelving Sandy beach out to rough breakers.  Good for surfing but not my sort of seabathing, too churned up and no visibility, snorkelling forget it.  However not to be churlish you can walk for miles on nice sandy beach with blue skies 😄 so nice to look at but I will be swimming in the pool.  There are a few points where water is flowing off land to the sea which was a bit whiffy!  Not sure what water quality standards are but would want to check before I went surfing.  If you look to left at the entrance point to the beach there is a narrow promenade walk (lol) guess what it’s full of scooters, endearing the way they use the pavements so look out and give way because they won’t!!! Along here there are a succession of beach bars and restaurants.  I wanted to give a 4 but went for a 3 purely because I like clear seas so maybe this is just me being picky because I had a lovely walk and the beach had been cleared quickly after the storm this week, so top marks there OH well, perhaps I will give it a 4 😄👏😄"
MPandu,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Sunset view is wonderful, and the wind breeze is very relaxing. There are just too much plastic here that some points are unwalkable."
vickew2016,"Middle Swan, Australia",Dec 2018,"We stayed in the month of December and found the beach full of rubbish and vegetation which washed ashore each day. However early each morning teams of locals arrived and cleaned it up, taking away loads of rubbish. So by mid morning the beach was all clean and beautiful again. One local did say that this only happens at this time of year because of the prevailing winds. "
DebsMmm,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2018,a beautiful place to sit and watch the sunset each day with a cocktail in hand.  So many places to choose to sit and listen to different musicians and have a snack and drink.
Sick B,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2018,There is rubbish everywhere and it is used by the stray dogs and cats as a giant litter box. It's not the most inviting of beaches. You are better off enjoying it from a distance at one of the many resort's that overlook it.
Williemac32,"Thurso, UK",Nov 2018,The beach is an awesome place to see the sunset. The beach is clean with various sections renting loungers and providing cold drinks/food. It also has various surf schools /rental of boards. Beach is well flagged showing possible rips. Surf can be quite wild depending on the weather.
Rina Cannon (Née Purba),"Chennai (Madras), India",Dec 2018,"Visited Seminyak Beach for the first time. Clean beach and good for relaxing. During this period or December, the waves is pretty high. Not good for swimming but perfect for surfing. "
JohnDaglas1,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,Great for a beer at beach tables. Awesome sunset - a must go avoid many restaurants ECT. SURFING dudes that set up tables & chairs in Afternoon amazing. Also Sun beds at reasonable prices

LUCY,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2018,Nice place to spend time with friends catching up the sunset. There's a lot of restaurants and cafe. Just pick what you like and how much money you wanna spend.
Mark and Mikaela,"Vientiane, Laos",Dec 2018,"Touristy, lots of people and nice little food stalls but it’s a shame that the stretch of beaches are all polluted with rubbish! "
Sachin0408,"Pune, India",Oct 2018,What might have been a wonderful beach in the past is currently in a sorry state of affairs. I have heard from so many friends that Seminyak was once a beautiful clean and clear beach but when I visited in October it was far from the truth. Human beings would never learn to behave and very soon this entire planet would turn into a pile of garbage. I felt sorry for the beach.
grey_hare63,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"I've been to Seminyak beach over the past few years and it has always been reasonably clean. But in my latest trip it was in a horrific condition with plastic and rubbish strewn across the entire beach for as far as I could see.  We went into the water and were surrounded by thousands of pieces of plastic wrappers and other rubbish!  It was brushing against our arms, legs and body! I wonder if this is a seasonal problem or permanent problem?  If the latter, then this will be the end of Seminyak beach as we know it... a very sad state of affairs."
Vicki W,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Dec 2018,We went their yesterday and the thing thst hit me straight away was the rubbish. It is disgusting. I was horrified. How can a beach like this be so iconic. I walked Into the water to my ankles and got hit with rubbish and walked straight out again. I am not interested in swimming with a heap of trash.We were at the far end and I thought may be it gets better further down. Nope it gets way worse. There are literally piles (like 20 feet high) of rubbish on the beach. Not just one pile but several. Are they relying on people being too drunk to notice that this beach is a rubbish dump.This is disgraceful. There were a few tourist (me being one of them) cleaning up the rubbish on the beach. That is not my idea of a day at the beach. Get your act together Bali if you want tourists to continue coming. 
Mintra,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2018,"This beach is disgustingly dirty. I stayed in seminyak for 5 days (first time in Bali) just walking distance to the beach and was extremely disappointed. It’s a combination of people littering as well as the sewage or river water getting dumped right onto this beach. Had to walk on the sand with shoes on and when I decided to put my feet in the water I was splashed with trash and rocks. Pick a different beach to go to like Ulu Watu, much cleaner. "
Pepperpot,"San Cayetano, Spain",Dec 2018,Beach is not nice it’s full of rubbish that they try to clean every day by hand and one digger. The waves are massive only fit for surfing. Going in the ea your legs get wrapped up in plastic bags and othe washed up rubbish
Vijay singh R,"Chandigarh, India",Dec 2018,"crowd is limited as compared to kuta beach, drinks are nice, clean beaches, superb view at sunset..."
Martin W,"Gravesend, UK",Nov 2018,"A really nice beach which they work hard at keeping clean. After an overnight storm lots of waste was washed up on the beach, which was cleaned up by the hotels and bars.From 4pm bean bags and sound systems come out so you can relax and watch the sunset. "
Cynthia A,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"Exactly, just another beach. There were pieces of rubbish along shoreline but this is a common sight of marine debris nowadays. The beach benches are rented for rp75000 per bench per hour. "
Elin N,"Oslo, Norway",Nov 2018,"The beach itself is sandy, fine and miles long. Not very suitable for swimming. Perfect for new surfers and bodyboards.A sunset beach - late afternoon restaurants and bars along the shore, makes the beach into a bar-street.Be aware of the tide ! Some places plastic and other garbage can drift in to the beach, due to current, wind and tide. Please bring a bag to help Seminyak a clean beach. Some of the sunbed owners often help to clean themselves 👍 Possible to snorkle some places very close to shore. In all a superb beach, even if it is difficult to swim there.  "
Dom N,25 contributions,Dec 2018,Nice beach with ample facility by the beachside.Good subset view. Specifically give a try to la cuciolla and Kuta de Kuta .
Linda G,"Hornchurch, UK",Nov 2018,Our hotel was opposite the beach so literally left the complex onto the beach which is a lovely beach both day and night. Many bars have live bands in the evening so great to sit and relax of an evening after spending a day doing nothing 
hamishb866,"Wichian Buri, Thailand",Nov 2018,"Really poor.Rubbish all along the beach,plastic,needles etc.Even when swimming you could feel plastic bags etc wrapping around your feet.Sunbeds expensive."
MegzNoel,"Coolangatta, Australia",Dec 2018,Probably one of the cleanest beaches I've seen on the island. There's also some swings which are food for photos.
Renno2355,"Liverpool, UK",Nov 2018,There are a number bars on the beach serving food which was excellent and cheap as is the beer Bintang.We walked from Butabelig beach to Kuta beach some 10 miles round trip. The beaches were full of plastics and general rubbish. I also picked up a light bulb and glass brown bottle which I dread to think what injuries they would have caused.The sea is quite rough with warnings of strong currents and red flags.
Damian S,"Victoria Point, Australia",Nov 2018,"Wife loved it.                       Said would recommend a look! Got drinks etc brought to them. Would go back for a look, but cant control the weather "
Paul H,"Garstang, UK",Nov 2018,"A very nice walk from my hotel to the beach, access is a bit limited, but once you are on it, a vast expanse of sand. "
Caroline East,"Berlin, Germany",Apr 2018,Sea is quiet and beautiful. Great for beginners. It's safer to crash on the sand than on a rifs. Miss it.
Elaine,104 contributions,Aug 2018,Long sandy beach that had many brightly coloured umbrellas and lounge areas to enjoy food and drink on the sand.  Lots of Lots of live music around. 
Jessie W,50 contributions,Nov 2018,Seminyak beach has more restaurants along the beach. We hv made right choice to stay at seminyak. Quiet and nice place
Michelle,"Brandon, UK",Nov 2018,Black sand that sticks to your feet. The amount of plastic and rubbish washed up on the beach is absolutely horrendous and upsetting. I cleared rubbish up on numerous occasions.  They should employ people to clean the beach often to keep it clean. The sea is too rough to swim in but ideal for surfers. Has the most amazing sunset and is very popular for that. 
Roy F,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,Went to the beach via Ku De Ta in the morning for a walk when there is less crowd. Nice view of the beach and sea.
Lin09,"Bromley, UK",Nov 2018,"Very disappointed.  The beach is large and plenty of good bars and restaurants with bean bags to sit out on, eat drink and watch sunset.   BUT there is so much plastic rubbish washed up with the tides. This gets cleaned up, often with tourists helping. But the plastic and rubbish on beach is a huge problem  and not a pleasure to walk through to get to the sea. Something needs to be done as this is not going away "
hornet450,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2018,Walked down to the beach to watch the sunset on Sunday. Hundreds of locals were there too. Really nice atmosphere & shared the sunset with local families enjoying an afternoon off.
Mikesgirls5,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"Wow Seminyak is a wide, long, colourful beach with big wakes for surf 🏄‍♀️ and for the young at heart. Loads of people especially for sunset 🌅. Lots to see and do would recommend to see and experience it."
Natalie79,24 contributions,Nov 2018,"The beach is beautiful, amazing sunsets/ sunrises, night life every night on the beanbags, great fun for everyone"
foodcrawlph,"1,536 contributions",Nov 2018,"Coolest, hippest, and the busiest part of Bali. Searched for a couple of accommodation options and chose to stay in Seminyak. Land transfers can be easily rented to any point of destination. Transportation within the area ranges from motorbike, GrabCar, GoJek, or the common Bluebird Taxi. We booked a decent hotel close to the beach. There are a lot of stores, restaurants, and specialty shops around. The beach provides a panoramic view by sunset and surfers flock in for the tide. "
Ronald Turambi Efraim Montolalu,"Jayapura, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"U can enjoyed u'r day in this beach, Walking and think your dream.... One day u can find something about your self and your dream also,... "
Martin A,"Beijing, China",Nov 2018,Lot of nice places to sit and enjoy one of exotic local drinks. Place for family or if you walk bit towards Legian beach some entertainment with light music..  Relaxing time...
Christie And Steve,"South Fremantle, Australia",Nov 2018,We love it down at Seminyak.. lots of places to choose to eat from on the beach and nothing beats a Bintang on a beanbag when it’s beaming with sun outside! Good surf for beginners too 😊
Swift D,13 contributions,Dec 2017,If you like surfing this is one of the beaches to come to as they have nice size waves you can hire a chair for 50 bah for the whole day they they have a variety of restaurants within walking distance as well.
Voyager08940156114,7 contributions,Nov 2018,"it was fun visiting seminyak beach with my family, not too crowded when we visited, and all my family was having fun there. Hope we can visit again in future. "
stillMeatSM-coffee lover,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"spend time here with my wife once, and found out that the beach is nice, we had dinner here but unfortunately the price is quite high for ous."
jody262016,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Nov 2018,"At this end of  the beach it was great, take a towel or hire a day bed. Cold drinks available from numerous esky set ups and sellers are there if you need sarongs etc go and watch the sunset it is amazing"
Tim O,"Spokane, WA",Nov 2018,"Seminyak is nice, but it is equally as busy.I am glad we stayed in this part of town as it seemed like a great bargain, but when we come back, we may go someplace more quiet and relaxing like Sanur."
SeanIFN,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,Good location for people who likes nature and would like a romantic walk with their significant half. Also great place for a swim and surfing although there are better beaches for this purpose.
Gwendoll,"Pitt Meadows, Canada",Oct 2018,"My first impression of Seminyak beach was simply: ""wow"".We went on a day that would be classified as an overcast but yet the beach was filled with people. Luckily the beach stretched on for miles on either side so there was plenty of room for everyone. I did not rent a lounger as I only planned on staying for a couple of hours but upon talking to the locals they were very friendly and the rates were reasonable to rent loungers.The sand on this beach is like no other, it is so soft yet sticks to your skin like paste. The beach was very clean and the water very refreshing. It was fun to watch surfers try to catch a wave."
Alexandra C,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Marvellous beach, dark sand, amazing mood. We went to a beach bar who had coloured umbrellas with lights that offered a whimsical surrounding. I felt safe also. People are very friendly."
Sylvia K,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2018,"Visited the beach after my visit to Petitenget Temple as it is just across the carpark from it.The beach reminded me of my uni days when I visited Mandura, Australia during summer.The sand is black and fine and hence, when you attempt to walk along the beach, it is advisable to walk bear footed.  It is rather safe to do so.If you intend to swim, you have to do so in the safe zone (between the flags).  The waves are crashing and therapeutic."
mariaom1523,"Birr, Ireland",Oct 2018,"An amazing beach which stretches for miles. Everything for sun lovers, surfers with superb schools, beach attendants, lively bars, toilets and showers . Sunsets glorious and attended by thousands of people from all round the world. Superb experience. Fine white sands and warm ocean-what's not to like?"
markbutt62,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,excellent local bars and restaurants along beach for all day sun baking to afternoon drinks while watching the sunsets or settle down for dinner at one off the bean bag restaurants
Guni G,"Tay Ninh, Vietnam",Oct 2018,Large beach with overwhelming sunset. Enjoying cocktails fron the pub on the beach and we all know that live is too short to stay at home. 
Deb davies,"Chepstow, UK",Nov 2018,Spent most time at double six beach it's beautiful stunning to sit relax and watch the sunset 🌅 just be aware of then selling you things on the beach that can be a bit of a pain  other than that. It's  lush 
Robyn F,"Newcastle, Australia",Oct 2018,I was impressed that a tractor cleaned the beach up to Legian each morning. The surf schools were always busy with lots of laughter. My husband enjoyed a surf while I walked along the beach warding off a few beach lounge sellers along the way. A nice way to start the day. 
Rachel G,12 contributions,Jul 2018,"This beach is great for surfing and watching beautiful sunsets. We had a great time surfing and lounging on beach chairs. However, it is incredibly busy and isn't overly blue or beautiful."
Nicolas D,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Nov 2018,The large waves make this beach great for Surfing rather than scuba diving or swimming. The beach is quite long making it a place for walkers and joggers. Please like this review if you found it useful. 
mjwnjw,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2018,Great beach to visit to sun yourself - people watch - have a Bintang - even do a spot of shopping ! Not far from Seiryu Villas so we walked down each day ! 
Sonia L,Butler,Oct 2018,Nice clean beach for a morning walk one side is full on bars/restaurants the other a lot quieter with mainly smaller  resorts.Lots of surfers & swimmers.
Howard M,66 contributions,Nov 2018,Dirty volcanic beaches. No cleaning. Over commercialised at sundown. Prices at the beach bars were more expensive than in town but still cheap compared to England. Worth paying a bit more to sit and watch the sunset with a chilled Bintang. (Local beer)
Alaa Hafez,Egypt,Nov 2018,It was a beautiful beach.. but a little bit boring ... But it was clean and the scene was very nice ..❤️❤️
Anton_away,United Kingdom,Aug 2018,The beach is nice but I am not very good with all the hassle from all the people trying to sell you everything from cigarettes to bows and arrows...
Pawas B,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"Very nice and clean beach. One of the best beach in Bali really enjoyed the evening.Very close to the seminyak square,  just at walking distance"
Annur K,"Newberry, FL",Nov 2018,"I enjoy spending the day here, if you are in Bali I recommend this beach. I spent my day walking around, having Balinese lunch and watching people. I will visit this place again in the near future"
LORIAN65,"Birmingham, UK",Oct 2018,"Rough and ready! You have colourful sun lingers cushions! With umbrellas, Restraunt’s/bars, all along the beach, nice and sandy,but very breezy beach waves quite high, making it ideal for surfing, but even the girls couldn’t keep themselves upright for long! They have full sorts of drinks I. The beach, it’s very hot,a place to relax and unwindI like the water s bit calmer for me"
alishusain,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2018,Seminyak beach is not my definition of best beach to visit when I am on an island. It’s a commercial beach. 
Jet34617587464,5 contributions,Oct 2018,Beautiful beach with crystal clear water. Enjoyed relaxing on the sunbeds with the waves dispersing before you. Just magic!
Joanne F,4 contributions,Oct 2018,"Awesome night sitting on the beach watching the sunset in seminyak definitely a highlight, drinks @nd live music on the beach a definite must for all"
Mark S,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2018,Very clean beach with soft black sand. Many options offered along the shore to enter and enjoy the beach clubs. Good waves depending on wind and tide. Very picturesque. 
mahlegrand,"Soest, The Netherlands",Oct 2018,Seminyak beach is one of the more hipster beaches Bali has.Enjoy the swing and watch sunset. Be aware you are on time!
Rosscodad,"Northamptonshire, UK",Oct 2018,"It’s a busy fun beach, but well looked after. Don’t go if you are looking for peace and quiet! Surf looks great, and plenty of places to hire boards, eat, drink etc. It’s colourful! Loads of sun beds to chill out on  for the day..... gets really busy around sunset, sit back on a coloured bean bag, and absorb the spectacular sun set. Great atmosphere... with beer in hand...and lively way to watch the sun go down. Definite ‘do once’ when you are on Bali! "
Helsie111,"Toowoomba, Australia",Oct 2018,Watch beautiful sunset on Seminyak Beach. Bring towel to sit on. Real Bali feel with the umbrella on the beach.
David W,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",Oct 2018,Clean beach. Not overly crowed except at sunset! Lots of surfing places to choose from. Unobstructed beach so you can run/walk all the way to Kuta beach. Lots of restaurants/bars offering places to sit for the sunset. Definite recommend. 
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"Beautiful but busy beach. Good to relax or surf or just a beach walk. The main entrance is at jln Dhynapura where you can find a lot of restaurants, pubs, bars and shops as well as hotels. Always a pleasure here."
Riham Addoum,"Beirut, Lebanon",Sep 2018,"Beautiful beach full of sunset bars and restos. Whenever you go, make sure to stick around till sunset time as the sky colors turn magical, one of the most beautiful sunset spots ever."
carinastaes,"Brussels, Belgium",Oct 2018,"Its a very nice beach that comes alive arround 3 oclock.the beach becomes very beautiful,they put beanbaggs and umbrellas and a lott off people comes to watch the sunset"
cycleshoot,"London, UK",Oct 2018,"Great beaches, great long walks & amazing sunset in evening . A must visit beach while In Seminyak. Perfect for the 6pm sunset too ."
Warwick S,"Lane Cove, Australia",Oct 2018,"If white sands, light breeze and gentle surf lapping your ankles is your vision then this beach may not always be for youGrey sand, a pounding surf and polluted shore greeted our first look You can hire a bean bag and watch the island sunset with a beer or visit one of the many hotel bars and clubs that line the shore It is busy and if you want seclusion this area may not be for you, however if you join the crowd , grab a beer you will fit in "
Sam W,"Goulburn, Australia",Oct 2018,Full credit to the locals here. The beach has really been cleaned up. A pleasant place to walk and relax now.  Well done 
Russell T,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2018,Relaxing on beanbags on the beach with music drawing a delicate background to the sound of breaking waves. Attentive staff providing food and beverages at our whim. I was so chilled I couldn’t feel my pulse.
susieque29,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2018,"Sad that such a long and stunning beach is so filthy. The sewerage that flows in to it from the is smelly and disgusting. Further along the beach, in front of Ku De Ta, the sewerage doesn't flow, but plastic cups and straws mix with the offerings on the sand. You have to dodge the plastic in the ocean. It's great to see the sunset, if you look past the rubbish."
nic0laf0x,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2018,good for older children playing in the water & flags available on the beach for swimming in. Water relatively dirty compared to what we are used to in NZ
CumbriaChevalier,Cumbria,Oct 2018,Lovely setting whether through the day or especially at sunset. There are opportunities to learn to surf or sit and relax with a beer and food. There are lots of beach restaurants offering good quality food and drinks.
Phoebe N,18 contributions,Jul 2018,Best spot to see sunset. There are lots of beach bars along the beach. You may grab a drink and relax by reading a book while waiting for sunset. There are also beach activities available.
lochiezacharyash2018,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,It is not the nicest beach in Bali. The east side of the island has the lovely beaches but not the sunsets.  It has black sand and is very smelly.
Nzlass,"Rotorua District, New Zealand",Oct 2018,"Lovely beach area with beach bars all along this area  get down early grab a drink, listern to the music and have the camera ready"
Robert B,"Province of Pontevedra, Spain",Oct 2018,We spend a fair bit of time here it’s a nice beach with some nice places to grab a beer and other drinks and sit on a bean bag and watch the sun setting
Haqibarra,6 contributions,Oct 2018,"Best spot to see the sunset. You can start beach acivity when you came here, u can chill with your lovely friends too, so many beach club there."
Annie K,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"Dropped off at the beach by courtesy vehicle attached to our Seminyak accommodation. There were pay for toilets nearby however  no changing sheds apparent.  Eventually I paid an attendant  for a toilet and changed in that.  Felt that a beach of this size and popularity  should have free  well signed changing  areas located at intervals along the beach front for beach goers to use.  Also ""Surfers Only""  signage was clearly  apparent on the sand along the beach and indicated to me as a visitor and  other beach goers  that there were no actual  areas that that the swimmers could go without sharing the water space with those surfing.  .  This is in fact  a safety hazard and appeared to be the case along  the entire  length of the  Seminyak beach where the surf is rolling in.  In the end - unable to find an area free of surfers and surf boards  we ended up just  dipping in the shallow areas and   swimming in an area that was utilized by a few surfers and then out of nowhere  a group  arrived  with instructors who were all   learning to surf because no areas had been cordoned off for just swimmers.    Not happy about this as an accident could have easily happened and we felt restricted in this beach/water situation."
Stockholmer_67,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2018,"This is not the Maldives or the Caribbean. One does not go here to swim in the sea, but it is great for surfers."
Trek802064,14 contributions,Oct 2018,"Views of the sun setting in the horizon was magnificent to experience.  Coupled with the atmosphere with crowds of people flocking the beach locals and tourists alike. All across the beach You See stretches of bars, restaurants and cafe, with outdoor settings.  At night time the beach lights up with live bands and music catered for most senses.   Disappointing to see plastic and rubbish littered across the sands though. Effluent from nearby streams are washed out to see so stay away from these areas.  Other than that, youll have local hawkers looking for a sale. If you catch there eye they will hone into you and haggle you to buy their products.  Not just one but a flock of hawkers will surrounding your location causing frustation and potentially ruining your peaceful place. I learnt to say ""no thank you"" in Indonesian - tidak terima kasih which they acknowledge more than saying it in English. Try it and see. "
Margaret O,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2018,"Worth a visit, I wandered from my hotel and explored the beach I was just having a quick look so I did not rent a sunbed. I did have a lovely young coconut to quench my thirst. As soon as I sat down I had ladies approaching me to buy their wares. I thought it a good time to buy some gifts for fellow work colleagues. I got a quick massage which I think I paid too much for. As I walked along the beach I could see people horse riding, having surfing lessons, and many colourful beach bars. I was at the beach mid morning. Worth a visit.   "
KwH819,"Northamptonshire, UK",Oct 2018,"This beach is fabulous with very colourful beach bars.Always wear flip flops though as the sand gets ridiculously hot!The tip i would give is stick to where the Air Asia umbrellas and loungers are. All the beach bars there have toilets.Passed that it is cooler and hipper but the beach bars don’t have toilets and the public ones are closed!Lovely chilled atmosphere with beanbag at the bars, which has no charge unlike the loungers. Just have to drink and/or eat."
LavishLady,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2018,Beautiful beach that stretches for miles and becomes very colourful as the sunsets with a hedonistic crowd and beautiful bean bags and umbrellas. The sand is yellow and the waters are a dark blue which can be wavy and rough but still very pleasant and great for surfers. I had three people massaging me on the beach for a few pounds it was amazing!! Lots of beach vendors but they actually had some lovely jewellery and art work and they are not forceful at all. Enjoy very much it’s the life :)
msizemore88,"San Antonio, TX",Oct 2018,Beach is great clean from debris and trash...waves are great. Good for surf or swim. We had a great time
corgi47,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,"Seminyak's vibe is hipper and cooler than Legian, and in particular, Kuta. It's very chilled and relaxed. The beach clubs are all pretty good, if not a bit same-same. The beach is lovely but the sand is darker than expected. Sunsets are amazing."
Sonica2012,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,We went to beach around sunset and must say the view is to die for. the sand is so good on the feat and pictures came out just perfect. the beach is quite clean and hav resturants to chill
PETER K,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,"Seminyak Beach is like any other, nothing special but a nice long walk in the early morning is great."
joycewalesengland,WALES ENGLAND,Oct 2018,nice beach but the waves were high and we had a red flag each day You have to barter for the price of the chairs as we got it cheaper the second time we went
Kimboc34,"Neath, UK",Oct 2018,"Enjoyed our days by the beach watching the surfers tackling sometimes crazy waves... beach is very clean & the beach sellers very friendly & accept it when you do not wish to be bothered. Make sure you negotiate your price for sun beds & umbrella.At sunset grab a beanbag & a Bintang & watch the sun go down, absolutely amazing & well worth doing..... "
Brent K,16 contributions,Oct 2018,"It wasn't a clean beach at all. Water from waste pipes were running straight into the sea. It smelled like the drains if Seminyak in most parts. Worst of all, used plastics (and condoms unfortunately!) were to be seen on the water edge. If it wasn't for the muck, this would be a fantastic beach. Sunset was gorgeous but we won't be back."
Christine S,"Seoul, South Korea",Oct 2018,"My expectations were low due to several reviews of the beach being unclean, but I found it very clean. Didn’t swim in it though. Nice to walk along."
priti sahay,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017,"While Bali has various wonderful beaches, we felt Seminyak beach offered a perfect blend of beauty and fun. There were so many nice restaurants with romantic ambience, good music and good food. There were bean bags on the beach and you can spend hours looking g at the ocean. It gave such a surreal feeling. There are good places to shop also around the beach. Our best evening in Bali was on the Seminyak Beach without a doubt. "
Taylor H,"Gilbert, AZ",Oct 2018,"Seminyak Beach is beautiful to look at, especially at sunrise. However, waves were very strong and difficult to swim in. Plastic was littered throughout the beach, stray dogs were everywhere doing their business, and it constantly smells like an outhouse. There are much better beaches in the world to visit. I guess Bali doesn’t have them. It’s too bad they don’t care more about their environment. "
JohnPaul78,"Swindon, UK",Oct 2018,Went here from the hotel was told it wasn't far so decided to walk rather than take a taxi. It was about 40 mins so not too bad.Beach is lovely but it was quite rough as the red flags were flying. But we enjoyed our stroll up and back in and out of the water. 
Sonia G,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2018,Surf spot during the day yes but it’s a Great place to watch the sunset and have a drink!must be visited !
Ozmurt,"Warrnambool, Australia",Oct 2018,"Very hot and very dirty, only positive no hawker but no shelter unless your at a motel. Try another location. "
Brandon C,15 contributions,Oct 2018,Bali is amazing. I would definitely recommend anyone to travel there. The people and the food are wonderful.  The price is very affordable too.
V3AS,"Kanpur, India",Oct 2018,"I loved staying at the Seminyak Beach area. The beach is clean, the shopping  is interesting & the pubs are very lively. The place has loads of resturants serving mostly all international cuisines. "
Ghumakad Geetika,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Oct 2018,The beach has a beautiful horizon sunset. The waves in morn us very strong. Not recommended for swimming.  For surfers excellent beach
Henwoods24,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Oct 2018,"Busy, rather dirty, full of umbrellas, and far too many people and motorbikes. It was exactly as we expected, as we have travelled throughout Asia before, but certainly don’t visit Seminyak expecting a great beach. "
Elmo3168,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,"Nice sunset view at this location. Great for a visit. There are many restaurants along the beach , great for enjoyment"
CharlotteKirsch,"Reading, UK",Oct 2018,This isn’t the most idillic beach you’ll ever see during the day. Just like most others and nothing special but during sunset it tops all other locations! Absolutely amazing. Sitting on the beanbags on the beach is just incredible to watch the sunset. 
marga,"Tenerife, Spain",Oct 2018,I spent two night in Seminyak close to the beach...If you are here you have to see sunset on the beach It’s really wonderful and you can see perfect 
glowworm27,Scotland,Sep 2018,We were a bit disappointed by this beach as there's a lack of sunbeds or outlets. The water is also really choppy so not recommended for swimming as there's often red flags up. Legian or Canggu are better for chilling.
Rob L,13 contributions,Oct 2018,Awesome beach with really helpful locals ensuring that if it is pampering you are after then you are in the right place . If you want to surf then you are in the right place also. Win win. 
djula1991,"Beijing, China",Oct 2018,The beach is clean and there are lots of waves for surfers. Surfboard rental is also available. Overall good for afternoon relaxing 
Sylvia DrSoul Fernandez,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Oct 2018,"This is a great beach for walking and jogging for it has sturdy sand and it has a lot of space! The small waves don’t seem good for swimming but ok for just having a dip in the water when you get too hot. Many nice shells to pick and many Beach chairs to pay for, restaurants and amazing sunsets!!"
CSJFR,"Ronse, Belgium",Sep 2018,I have no idea anymore wich beaches we have fine but we stayed in Seminyak and we did every beach. They are all a bit different but all good. We loved Manu beach house.
Pamela K,"Boston, MA",Jul 2018, Highly recommended- great beach without the crowds.  Waves and tides can be very strong though so stay aware. 
Wael D,4 contributions,Jul 2018,"This side of Bali Island is well known for Kite Surfing and Surfing generally due to high waves and strong wind.The Water is not clear and the sands are dark ""more like Mud""."
Westade75,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2018,Probaly would want to be a competant swimmer before you took a dip... Also make sure your injection and imunisations are up to date as the water looks pretty dirty...Not as hectik as Kuta though.. Not as many hawkers harrsssing you to buy junk either. 
ronster68,"London, UK",Sep 2018,A great beach which is perfect for long walks or even runs.The times I visited the sea was perfect fir surfers due to the waves and probably not too good fir swimmers.This is a very popular beach for people to watch the sunset and wow they are amazing.There are a number of bars and hotels to choose from should you wish to sit and have a drink while the sun goes down.It gets very busy. 
A7079CEjanes,"Worcestershire, UK",Sep 2018,"This is great beach but its mainly used by surfers as the waves are large.  All the time we were there, its seemed to be kept clean.There are lots of great bars to watch the sunset, the only downside was the hawkers trying to sell you stuff. A few of them would not take no for an answer.   I managed to go horse riding and its a great beach for this, its long and wide with lots of room."
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2018,Nice beach bars and restaurants along the beachNice place for dinner while watching sunset.Not as rowdy and dirty as Kuta beach and Legin beach
Scozziegirl,"Bassendean, Australia",Sep 2018,We walked here from our hotel for our first look at the beach in Bali. The seas were high and the beach was quiet so we had a easy walk from Ku DeTa up to Petinget beach and back. 
rolandlinda1,"Atenas, Costa Rica",Sep 2018,"This is a really beautiful beach, but waters are rough with big waves.  Consequently this beach attracts mostly surfers.  They do have nice lounger chairs that you can rent and people watch.  "
Escape683290,3 contributions,Sep 2018,Sat at Franks Bar on the beach had many bintangs...dinner next door at beach hut to watch the sunset What a wonderful experience met many new friends....
KapitiKiwis,"Raumati Beach, New Zealand",Sep 2018,"We went for walk along the beach. Grey sand, heavy seas for this time of year but clean. No shells. Not worthy for return. Great view at a distance."
Vinay S,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018,"Seminyak might comparatively be a quieter option among the ones you have on the stretch that includes Kuta and Double Six, but it can still get pretty crowded. Reason for that could be the fact that it has fantastic waves for those who seek to surf, and lets you enjoy one of the most majestic sunsets in the region. With an array of bars and restaurants facing the sea, you get enough and more places to just sit on a beanbag, gulp your beer with delicious starters, and enjoy the sunset. But with all those people and each restaurant playing their music, it can get a bit buzzy."
Amo572016,"Margaret River, Australia",Sep 2018,"We went to view the sunset on our last evening in Bali, and it didn't disappoint.Lots of people but it didn't feel crowded at all. "
Bridget R,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,It has the most amazing sunsets and best place to have a drink and some food on the beach whilst listening to music. Later in the night either a dj will play or live band !! 
Irene A,5 contributions,Sep 2018,"We stayed near the Double six beach, the beach is pretty clean compared to Kuta. The best is when you swim at the indian ocean while watching the sunset. And of course coconut water."
bffbpoole,"Darwin, Australia",Sep 2018,This beach is clean and has many fine places to dine and drink all at a reasonable price we have always enjoyed this beach for all ages 
tommymoir,40 contributions,Oct 2017,Not my favourite beach. I found it  bit of a nuisance to get there first of all. What i found was a beautiful looking beech.  What i missed was natural shelter trees etc. I wad also warned of the potential rips in the area maybe that was why there was not many people in the water.  Sorry looks lovely but i prefer Kuta
TraciePAustralia,Australia,Sep 2018,"The waves were huge great for the surf lessons(even they waited til later when it calmed) we saw several rips so not for the little ones. We tried to relax on the lounges and have a Bintang and a swim but we were hassled that much buy the local wares we gave up and went back to the hotel pool. At night it's a fantastic spot to relax in a bean bag and listen to the live music, have a meal and watch the sunset. "
Rahim Y,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2018,"Very relaxing. A place your should at least spend a few hours, sit + drinks + have a meal + enjoy the sound of the wavesNight is perfect. Afternoon will be too hot. "
Cornelius,United Kingdom,Sep 2018,"Nice beach to have a early morning walk on, good for sunbathing & activities rest of the day, decent choice of beach bars and the likes, would recommend."
Deb A,queensland,Sep 2018,"we stayed at seminyak and in the afternoon would go to the beach for a couple of bintangs and watch the sunset and we found this great bar called sunset hut run by Duncan and with the help of Frankie and Rodney what a great crew, and they are well traveled so knowledgeable of bail and many other places plus they are always keeping an eye on things, whilst we were there they saved 2 kids in a rip. Highly recommend it is just opposite jayakarta resort facing beach just to your left."
Endru_06,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2018,The place that you can see sunset while dringking you beer. Very relaxing. will go there again soon...!
Julie S,19 contributions,Sep 2018,"It's very relaxing place to while away a few hours, bean bags under an umbrella with a table and table service,  amazing staff and the pizzas a fairly good."
MaraMara M,"Belgrade, Serbia",Sep 2018,"I’ve never seen such big waves in my life. The beach is endless and has a lot of nice cafees.swiming is almost impossible, not suitable for little children and children without adults. I haven’t seen not even single lifeguard and currents are pretty strong and waves pretty big."
Barty,29 contributions,Sep 2017,"We had fun here.....the beach is clean enough, not as busy as Kuta, beach sun chair & board rentals are not at rip-off price. The only gripe is the peddlers approaching you at times. Recommended "
Tony W,"Orpington, UK",Sep 2018,The beach is long and fairly wide so is generally not crowded. The sections with sun loungers are busier but still ok.  The only really busy time and at sunset when hundreds visit to see the sunset. The tide has been rough whilst here so not able to swim from the beach. 
Veronique V,"Voorburg, The Netherlands",Sep 2018,Not a place if you are looking for calm and silence.Always disturb by people who want to sell any kind of things.The beach is really dirty and definitely for children.
teckjong,"Melaka, Malaysia",Sep 2018,Very crowded beach. Not like what we imagine. Views were blocked by sea of people and their ongoing activity.. 
Ren1211,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2018,"A nice spot to come and hang out, it's not the best beach in Bali but it is still beautiful and still a beach."
colleengiddings,"West Sussex, UK",Oct 2017,"Lovely sunbeds and very cheap for whole day and get a parasol too, lovely cold beer and coconut milk ice cold, loved the locals selling their wares along the beach made some lovely friends especially Wayana and Ellie sea is bit rough but still went in."
Christopher M,5 contributions,Aug 2018,"take a stroll along the sea, see kite flying, ride horse back, surf, eat and drink, comfy sun loungers (haggle for a deal) a great way to pass the time and get a tan"
JoLloyd,"Auckland, New Zealand",Sep 2018,We came down several times to have a Bintang and watch the sunsets.. turn right instead of left and have better views of the glorious sunsets without the crowds :) Cheap beer and free views! 
SummerPoka,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2018,"This a beautiful beach with some of the most beautiful sunsets I have ever seen, but don't expect to be able to swim as the waves are very strong. Unlike other reviewers, I found the beach very clean, there was no littering at all during my visit in August.I stopped at the beach twice, once at sunset to enjoy the view and relax at one of the beach cafes, and it was perfect. The second time, I tried to swim and sunbathe and things were not ideal as the sand is black and tends to get very stick and hard to wash off, and the ocean has very strong waves.So if you go for sunset and evening vibes, not for swimming, you will be very happy."
Deb K,"Glenelg, Australia",Sep 2018,"Seminyak is good any time of the day, but from 4 p.m. onwards it takes on a whole new vibe. Lots of beanbags and umbrellas along the beach, out come the horses for a sunset ride. Chiringuito and La Plancha are great places for food and drinks. Chiringguito has the best wood fired pizzas, and nice clean toilets."
Chrysantha F,2 contributions,Sep 2018,Nice beach very safe beautiful view to see the sun setting don't need to Go to uluwatu you can see the sun setting from the beach
Ssmmiejay,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,"Seminyak Beach in the dry season is very clean.  Compared to when I went in January when there was rubbish all over the beach, this time I went there was none!  Make the effort to go down there before sunset and pull up an beanbag to soak up the sun, beer and sunset.  I even saw lots of people swimming!"
tonysyd274,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2018,On our last trip 3 years ago we remembered the beach and ocean being really dirty. Now it’s looking great and a beach you can happily grab that surf lesson or sit an watch an incredible sunset at one of the bars 
sab93924,"Warrington, UK",Sep 2018,"I wish I had known that it would cost to rent the sun beds every day as I would’ve planned accordingly. Average price that people say is 200,000 but we haven’t paid above 100,000 for two. We have found that outside Capil Beach is the best spot as such and if you come later in the day the guy will give you a cheaper price than the rest! If you rent a sunbed you can use the toilet inside the restaurant as well. We also learnt to surf with these guys who are a right laugh and we both stood up first time There is lots of surfers and areas not suitable to swimmers along this section of the beach so I wouldn’t recommend to weak swimmers or young childrenThere is heaps of plastic and rubbish along the length of the beach, very sad to see! We have spent time out of our day to clean up "
Alaksander,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2018,"The beach is nice to walk on. the smooth white sand, nice sunsets and dotted with luxury resorts. However at the end of the beach before Legian beach or Double six, there is a smelly sewage that is hard to cross. We had to walk back.."
Swarnima V,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2018,"Perfect place to enjoy the sun, sand and the weather. We went in the evening, it was a 10 minute walk from our hotel- had a nice long stroll by the beach. It’s very clean and well kept  Sunset at the beach is a must watch for all visitors of Bali ... shacks here are nice ! U can try la plancha food and music !! "
Steve T,"Midland, Australia",May 2018,We from West Australia go up here and always ask why don't they clean the beach? the views are breathtaking and people are nice just needs a government to get in with the right equipment and clean the beach every day and not dump rubbish in the ocean. Why they don't look at fixing this has been the question fro 20 years.
Andhika K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2018,"As a local tourist,Bali is my fav place to escape from the hectic life of Jakarta, so I prefer to stay near the beach and not in rush to visit many places. Seminyak beach is my fav to spend the time and enjoy the sunset. It has magical view to see when the Sun sets with the red and golden sky.."
Neil3333,"Yeovil, UK",Aug 2018,"Great for surfers, not good for swimmers. We found the beach to be very polluted! walks on the beach included stepping over dirty nappies! not the idillic beach it could be"
keys4321,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2018,"Not overly crowded, beautiful beachfront, clean, all in all a great place to hangout with friends or just alone..."
Katia K,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2018,"One of the most beautiful sunsets you can see in Bali is on the Seminyak beach. And if you like to enjoy sunset with a cocktail in your hand, there are plenty of bars with comfy bean bags. The atmosphere is great here! Although very crowded as this is a popular spot in Bali, so be prepared and come a bit earlier It can be nice during the day as well, not a typical “white sand blue water” kind of beach - but you can practice surf or have lunch while watching huge waves."
Slldcl,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Seminyak beach is clean, safe,  water clear and warm. Sand is darker than the white sands of Australia. Lots of restaurants are lined along the beaches, many with bands or music playing. Very family friendly, not too many hustlers."
radwas473,"Princeton, NJ",Aug 2018,We are a family of 2 adults and 2 kids visiting from the USA. We loved this beautiful sandy beach. Walking distance to everything. Great waves. We had a blast!
ngj4,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2018,Family with 2.5yo toddler. It's ok for lounging around but not that good for children. Parts of beach close to fancy hotels are manicured otherwise rubbish in others. 
Debbie R,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,Perhaps we are a bit spoilt but we found this beach a bit disappointing with harsh black sand and lots of people.
DrNitinPuri,"Jalandhar, India",Aug 2018,Its a average beach with lots of pubs/restuarants on it. Beauty of sea is like any other beach. Sandy beach where some time can be spend
p4pranjal,"Surat, India",Aug 2018,This beach is a nice place to relax. White sand and a great sunset to watch. The water current is high so it is not advisable to go for swimming. I saw 3 people drowned in the sea. but there are life guards who saved them. Take care of kids and not let them go un attended in the sea. Overall a good place. 
Raag7,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018,Beautiful and clean beach. Good place for surf . Lots of bars good beer and cocktails vibrant beach umbrellas.
amtraveller_50,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2018,Grab a bean bag and enjoy the sunset! A relaxed beach. Perfect for walking along. Great surf and lots of places to eat and drink.
Adelaide_Cat,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2018,A beautiful but busy beach with lots of great beach bars offering a nice relaxed vibe for some sunset beers and cocktails.
JonNewport,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,I have been coming to Bali for 35 years and today the beach was the cleanest I have ever seen. We walked from the temple near Laluciola to Jl Melasti and the beach was very clean. Congratulations to the beach staff for a job well done.Terima Kasih
JennyWilson0403,12 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach was ok, nothing great, and there was a fair amount of rubbish on the beach. They tried to cover it out by taking it out with a tractor I think, but as the day wore on it just all came to the surface of the beach. There are loads of nice beach bars and restaurants all the front, where it was nice just to relax, have a few drinks and some food."
Princess Leia,"Pyeongtaek, South Korea",Aug 2018,Seminyak has a lot of Bars and restaurant along the beach and its nice to just hang around and relax ... Clean and good for Surfing too ...
Alaa Gamaleldin,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2018,Good option Enjoy the nice views during sunset Suitable for coming early or at sunset Sandy nice beach area 
luisa25,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2018,This was my third time to this part of Bali and the cleanest the beaches have ever been! So nice not to dodge rubbish on our morning strolls.
Emma H,"Birmingham, UK",Aug 2018,This is a very busy beach with bars and restaurants all along the front with great menus. Although it’s busy it has a buzz and plenty of beds to hire. The sunsets here are also beautiful.
drshefalijanak,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2018,"We stayed at The Oberoi ... which is right at the Seminyak beach... clean, nice beach... watching sunset was so beautiful and serene! Kude ta and The Potato Head are the highlights on the beach!!"
Jimmy N,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,Take the time to stroll around the village after being on the beach. Some good eating places there…Loved the Greek restaurant on the main drag..
Carla F,30 contributions,Aug 2018,We had never seen waves like we have in Bali. We liked the beach was lovely to have a walk along and watch the surfers.
Brooke E,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,"Seminyak beach is a typical tourist beach which it slightly quieter than Kuta. We happily spent the day there renting sunbeds, and checking out the bars along the beach, definitely caters for all budgets. The beach can get extremely busy at times especially around sunset time. The sunsets were beautiful. As mentioned in pervious posts rubbish can be an issue. "
stephenbH4999ZR,"Australind, Australia",Aug 2018,"Love this beach great surf, great people, great food. If you just want to sit & watch the world go by this is the place then top it off with an awesome sunset, you just won’t go wrong!"
Carol O,33 contributions,Aug 2018,"Lots of activity on Seminyak beach. Chairs and umbrellas to hire, drinks and ice cream to purchase, surf lessons etc. or just soak up the sun and read a book. Easy to get to, safe for swimming and perfect for early morning beach walks and sunsets"
Nick M,Brit in Copenhagen,Jun 2018,"Magnificent waves, ideal for surfing, but be a bit careful with the kids, the sea can get pretty rough. Plenty of good beachside bars and we were surprised how clean the beach was in June. "
default230820183,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2018,"Yes it’s slightly crowded, not so quite like Canggu or Nusa Dua. But, you can catch one of the most surreal sunsets from this beach. I was chilling on the Double Six Beach in Seminyak, had one of my best sunset experiences here. Well yes took advantage of the crowded places and met a lot of people, made conversations and learnt so many things on travelling and exploring Bali and more. It’s definitely worth it. "
snowges,112 contributions,Aug 2018,"Can't say I am an expert on Bali beaches but this is a nice beach. Not too crowded, no boats and a nice place to jump in.Awesome sunset...and isn't that what sets a beach aside?"
739Paul000,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2018,We went from Sanur to Seminyak initially for a couple days. it took 2 1/2 hours to get there its about 20ks. Check in to the medium priced city centre hotel which was ok? Then went for a walk on the beautiful beach NOT it was absolutely full of plastic right up to the high water mark. popped into a beachside hotel KU DE TA was the name. Talk about embarrassing. gangs of precocious teens spending rich daddies money on expensive drinks $20 a pop. Whilst teasing and laughing at the local beach hawkers. Needless to say we checked out the next day and went back to Sanur's pristine beaches and genuine people
CheshireIanc,Cheshire,Jul 2018,I found it impossible to swim due to the overwhelming plastic pollution in the sea. you were also battling with the surfers encroaching on the swimming area
Doubleo03,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Great busy beach but the water is a bit tough great for surfers Lots of great restaurants to choose from too 
Kiwi traveler,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Aug 2018,"Seminyak beach is a nice long sandy beach, you just have to get used to being hassled to purchase things, and being asked every couple of minutes. But it’s a great beach to relax on a lounger and read a book. Beach has huge swells so is great for surfing."
Jan L,"Ghent, Belgium",Aug 2018,"It was a visit not with friends but with adult kids ... but since that option did not show, I consider my kids to be friends. The beach is lovely. Large, windy, high waves, not too many people. Just the right place for a beach walk. Or a sunset picture. You do not go there for swimming or sun bathing."
Malarchy,"Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo",Jul 2018,"Seminyak Beach is a long strip of sand on Bali's west coast.  It is largely a yellow sand beach but not especially fine.  The waves are not huge but do much more than lap at the edges so the area attracts bodyboarders and the like.  The beach runs for quite a while so it is worth picking the right spot.  A good option is in front of Ku De Ta as it seems to be a bit cleaner than some other parts.  Sunbeds are available but are quite pricey, it is just as easy to use a towel instead.The beach does have a fair few people but nowhere near as many as crowd into Kuta.  This is not the leisure of isolation but equally is not overcrowded.Cleanliness is always an issue on Bali beaches but it isn't terrible.  Seminyak beach around Ku De Ta is in reasonable condition.There are hawkers on the beach but aside from being intrusive they are not overly aggressive.The beach itself is not ideal for sandcastle making but for splashing in the waves it is a really fun place."
Noel H,4 contributions,Aug 2018,Very nice sunsets.....great people and food..beach very nice for families and surfers......very close to hotel...so walking was easy..
G8814TXandrew,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"We found the beach to be dirty, & not an enjoyable experience, beaches outside resorts appear to be tidier"
Ankita A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,"Centrally located in bali, this beach is ok if you'd like to watch the sunset. However, it is quite crowded (mostly with Australians holidaying) and you would not be able to spend much time in water since seabed is really grainy. I even got grazed by a couple of pretty big stones while in water.One advantage is that it is situated right opposite Ku De Ta beach club so you can swim/ relax/ watch sunset/ drink/ eat all in a couple of hours."
Ccordo1,Montreal,Aug 2018,"Long coastline to walk along. Some areas have more waves than others. Unfortunately there is a bit of plastic litter as well.Lots of people, but you can find some quieter zones.You can easily find chairs and parasols to rent.Restaurants are nearby."
Ingrid T,12 contributions,Jul 2018,Great beach to sit and soak up the rays and atmosphere or watch the kite flying and people watch. Close to the shopping centre and great eateries. Good walk along beach to Double Six Beach or even further to Kuta Beach. 
John G,72 contributions,Aug 2018,"The beach itself is great, especially if after some waves....but it really needs looking after...I picked up broken glass on 2 occasions, and the amount of plastic waste coming on shore is a very sorry sight ...apart from myself and one family I saw picking the litter, I see no other effort generally...It’s all of us’ problem and we need to take collective responsibility for it :-)"
Nigel M,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2018,A massive beach that gives you the best of everything. Areas around the bars tend to be busy but walk along the beach and you will find quieter areas. The beach was clean and the waves were good without being dangerous
Tomas141,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Very clean beach with good long views and nice fine sand. Swimming not really possible as it’s too rough and has strong rips. You can splash around in the waves though. 
Sanjeev Ohri,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018,spent a good time here with my child who is 5 years and he played so much with the sand. outlets are good and beach is very clean. no matter how much you play with the sand you never get it home as sand doesn't stick for long
adm12017,"London, UK",Aug 2018,"This is really quite a nice place to visit. I'd recommend getting here an hour before sunset, finding some bean bags at one of the beach bars and ordering some drinks and appetisers to watch the sunset.It's a nice vibe and most of the bars are either playing Balearic beats or have live acoustic musicians going on.It does get busy, but it's nicely chilled out and an enjoyable way to watch the sunset.There are lots of vendors walking past trying to sell you trinkets, but they aren't pushy and a gentle wave off sends them on to someone else.Plenty of places around for food and drink too."
Roger J,34 contributions,Jul 2018,Very very busy and vibe is great...lots to see and do. Try to stay close to the beach so that you can walk to the beach. Lots of cool bars along the beach.
David B,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2018,"I didn’t find much to enjoy at Seminyak Beach. Murky water, rubbish everywhere and crowds of people wandering around taking pictures of said water and rubbish.There’s a few beach clubs along the way which serve food and drinks to you while you sit on bean bags facing the water. Might be better if the view was good."
6419,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"Nice clean beach, many options for light lunch and a beer on the beach. The restaurants have clean toilets, so a family day out is good. You can bargain for the sun beds and even book by the hr so don’t pay the initial asking price.Life guard on duty, watch out as the sea has a strong current."
Magdalena K,"Hikkaduwa, Sri Lanka",Jul 2018,"If you’re surfing, but still learning how to catch a good wave, it might be interesting place for you. If you’re looking for white sand and crystal blue ocean, Seminyak won’t be amazing for you... nice for the sunset though."
Linda N,5 contributions,Jul 2018,Would be nicer if the hawkers left you alone .. they tend to hound you relentlessly .. maybe thats just part of Bali I dont enjoy
Richard S,"Leicester, UK",May 2018,"Lovely sandy beach however, there are stray dogs that roam free along the beach and do their business on the sand so you do have to be careful where you're walking... The beach is packed at around 6pm when the sunsets but when we went for a walk down the beach around 6:30ish there is a marge amount of litter that people leave behind, tourists and local people seem to thing it's ok to leave the bottles and plastics lying around for the tide to come in and wash it all out to sea. That was the disappointing this as we were expecting a beautiful beach which is was until sunset, it was just a shame that people couldn't do their bit to help keep it tidy too..."
brancolyn,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018,"This is Seminyak, it is busy and there is lots to look at.  The beach is not beautiful, and we did not swim here, although others were surfing.  You can see that it has rips, so be careful.  Lots going on here, great place to grab a drink at one of the restaurant/bars and watch the sunset.  Black sand, and a little polluted."
Lligla,"Walcha, Australia",Jul 2018,WE love being on Seminyak beach--waves are  huge so need to be careful and be sensible! It's great to walk along before breakfast or in evening. always quite a lot going on as well. Not so sure about the wet season though.
RobsterWirral,"Cheshire, UK",Jul 2018,What a truly charming place. The people are so friendly. The bars are great the health food shops amazing. Highly recommended for all ages!!!
Sid,"Navi Mumbai, India",Jul 2018,"Not might impressed with this beach , too crowded and not very clean , especially if you visit the other beaches in Bali "
David W,30 contributions,May 2018,When on holiday in the area we regularly met up with friends and family on this beach which is just wonderful - easy to get cheap beer and food on the beach or very nearby.  If in the area a must visit.
A Swede travels - Ämma,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2018,"Nice place, love it! Right now the waves are too big to swim in but still Nice to be at the beach anyway. "
Gill Smith,30 contributions,Jul 2018,Definitely visit double 6 beach. Day time. Sit and relax.  Night time. Spectacular views music great friendly atmosphere. It really is just amazing.
tim6091,"Vancouver, Canada",Jul 2018,"All the beaches we went to in Bali were quite dirty, there were people constantly cleaning, but so much plastic and garbage in the morning."
sammieb42018,"Ballina, Australia",Jul 2018,I live in a beautiful location in North Eastern NSW where we have beautiful beaches.  I didn't go to Seminyak for the beaches.  Nice to walk along and sunset dinner or drinks though.
bob764,Switzerland,Jul 2018,"A may sound like an old record but this beach is not what is used to be. Obviously a great place to spend the day since its so crowded. I you rent a surf board or body board make sure you rent an instructor with it, unless experimented. "
Rawinia H,"Bicton, Australia",Jul 2018,Loved the Beach at Night.. It’s amazing sitting there under the umbrellas with a bottle of wine and food...Great place to hang out and watch the sunset..
josephine,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,all the beaches in Bali are very beautifulSeminyak beach is located next to Double Six Beachhas its own beauty while enjoying the sunset
markhoman1962,"London, UK",Jul 2018,"This is truly a beautiful beach, on our current family holiday of SE Asia we hired a private villa very close to this beach. Myself and wife had a morning run each day along the beach, it was beautiful. After breakfast the whole family would go back to the beach for sea swimming and surfing, with the super soft sand this beach has everything. As with most beaches the terrible waste washed up on the beach was evident to see, however there were local groups who regularly worked in groups to clean the beach (well done to the locals doing your bit for the environment) "
Parabroad,"Portsmouth, UK",Jul 2018,"Arrived at the beach on our first night after dark, no idea or concept what lay in front of us! We ate at one of the beach places that had bean bags on the sand whilst we listened to the live music. Nice and sandy beach and seemed clean.Next morning we came back down to spend the day and were welcomed by the most amazing surf and sandy beach! Miles long with plenty of space.We hired a couple of sun beds (haggle- we got them down to 100,000 rupees for two for the whole day).Stay till the sun goes down, the colours are amazing!Watch out for the stray dogs though.Great beach."
Ralph S,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jul 2018,"Nice beach to surf and chill. Have some drinks at one of the beach clubs or even better, stay at one of the 5 Star hotels and enjoy the beautiful sunsets."
escapewithkitty,"Western Australia, Australia",Jul 2018,kites snax sunset surf offer of massage and sarongs galore... sunset is the best time to grab a local snack as home chefs head sown to catch the locals & families as the enjoy the sun going down 
jackie77w,"Coventry, UK",Jul 2018,We went to the beach for the stunning sunsets and located ourselves at the Potato Head Beach Club. Extremely clean but many pedlars which is off putting
Skin197,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Sat on loungers under an umbrella cost was IRD 150,000 included a bogey board. Annoying people trying to sell you stuff like bow and arrows, fake watches, hats, kites, sarong. Smell from nearby river awful! Safe beach for swimming compared with Canggu and white not black sand "
MeryemBagis,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2018,"Best beach in Kuta, sunset is wonderful, very clean area. At night, there will be enjoyable parties at the beach."
Neil D,459 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach has a good selection of bars at the top of the beach. These bars put out bean bags for sunset. The food at these bars is a bit higher prices than off the beach.There are plenty of sun beds available anytime of year, even more at high season. The sunbed sellers also rent surf/boogie boards and give surging lessons.A direct route to Seminyal beach is down Jalan Campung Tandak. "
virtueleighanne,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Something to remember , sitting in the bean bags on the beach amongst hundreds , watching the sun go down. "
BillyTokyoist,"Istanbul, Turkey",Jul 2018,"If any chance to stay beach side at bali for surfing , shopping , enjoying world cuisines that I believe Seminyak is best area to stay... can find quite or noise at around and walking relax less then kuta area..."
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2018,"Lots of bars, restaurants and clubs along this stretch of beach. A good place to have a few drinks or dinner while watching the sun go down."
krenaningtyas,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2018,Ambience is different from Kuta Beach. This beach is located in the luxurious Seminyak area which is offered a new style of enjoying Bali beaches. 
Laura199472,"England, UK",Jul 2018,"The beach goes on forever, its very clean, the sea is warm and very wavey - too strong even for surfing throughout our visit. With very strong currants also.Price of sunbeds vary along the beach, and there are not many places to get onto the beach from the road.The beach isn't crowded in terms of people sitting on it, but there are always hundreds of people walking along the beach. "
Around the World,"Berlin, Germany",Jul 2018,This part of a long strip isn’t so developed even the beach road is full of branded shops nobody needs. We came across of one of the beach clubs and had a break for a drink. There are only tourists sitting with a smartphone and taking selfies and staring on it. Creepy & funny at the same time. They pay a lot of money to fly thousands of miles and end up in one of the beach club with their smartphones. I feel it’s so boring and after the drink we left. So Seminyak beach is more for overdressed tourists which forget to shop at home or believe that branded stuff is cheaper here. And along the beach is like a canal. Very smelly and not nice. 
_richnolivia,"Wairarapa, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Seminal beach is very clean.  The people that sell goodies on the beach are Lovely they take no for an answer.Visit Sally or Kites they will make up brackets and necklaces to suit you.Security guards are very friend along with Balinese people always smiling.BEAUTIFUL sunsets to see. 
Colincfc,"Maidstone, UK",Jul 2018,"Loungers on beach pretty expensive 300000 for 5 hours prepare to haggle as they start around 600000, turtle came ashore near us which made our day prepare to be hassled all day by sellers generally the same ones you told 5 mins previous,  "
Teresa M,16 contributions,Jul 2018,We really enjoyed the beach at the Ku De Ta end and really loved Ku De Ta and the facilities. Would definitely go back.
Logan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2018,Clean beach . Beside kuta square. Alot of dining areas. Beach activities.. good waves for surfing . You are able to rent a surf board
rahulladhad,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2018,A nicw beach. Unless nusa Dua beach which is white sand beach this beach is a black sand beach. A great place to learn surfing and located near to market area. Best time to visit is early morning by 8:30.
srmurray2015,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Lovely beach lots of lounges for hire. Plenty of great little bars for Lowe cost eats and  drinks . Becareful in the surf it gets very big and rough . Nice spot to watch the sunset with a beer or cocktail 
Brian A,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018,Great place to get away from the bustle have a cold beer and watch the sunset. Not too crowded compared to Kuta. Lots of places to get cold drinks good prices and many types of food available also good prices. Easy enough to walk to the beach from many hotels or a cheap taxi ride.
Sunny C,"Sunbury, Australia",Jul 2018,"Beautiful sunsets with friendly locals.We stayed at the Breezes Resort & Spa which was in short walking distance to Seminyak Beach.  The beach is lovely to walk along, but I wasn't enticed to swim.  My husband ticked off his bucket list item to learn surfing.You can hire a shaded deck chair for 50,000IDR - depending on your negotiating skills this could be for a couple of hours or a whole day (depending on demand as well!)Great beach for long walks as you can stop for refreshment at plenty of places along the way."
Gokul M,"Toronto, Canada",Jul 2018,Found that the beach was not overcrowded. Overall quite neat. Enough vendors around if you want to grab a bite or drink. Had a great time at the beach. Waves were quite intense which made the experience all the more enjoyable. 
rnbstone,"Zushi, Japan",Jun 2018,"My family and I wandered to the beach via Ku De Ta and paid for a couple of chairs, umbrella, and boogie boards (I think we paid 150,000).  There were not many people on the beach, as it was a weekday and it was later in the afternoon.  If you go, expect to be hassled by the wandering vendors.  I must have been asked 20 times if I wanted to buy a watch, sarong, kite, get a massage, or have my hair braided.  It gets annoying when you're trying to close your eyes and rest.  While the beach looks nice, the smell is more of a port a potty.  I kept looking for canals of water pushing raw sewage into the ocean, because that's what it smells like.  My whole family noticed it, and eventually we left - not staying for sunset because the smell was just terrible."
Cams R,290 contributions,May 2018,"I’m more of a white-sand-beach-kind-of-girl but I actually enjoyed seminyak beach. It’s a surfer’s haven I guess. Coz of the waves. Good ones. I found the sand a bit glittery and shiny (though it’s brown/dark) so I enjoyed walking, enjoying the sun and the wind. It’s not too crowded compared to Kuta. A lot of people offering umbrellas and beach/lounge chairs but it’s pricey and you pay per hour. I suggest you bring a mat or beach towels instead of paying for those chairs. "
Alex27,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Send is volcanic, sea is wild and not good for swimmers. You are better to stay in resort and just look into the water. Good for walking and you can jump into many different beach clubs for a drink. "
Paul F,"St Peters, Australia",Jul 2018,"Wandered down for a few hours on the beach with the family. Nice surf, clean with lots of beds and sun lounges quite cheap. Not too many people bothering you for cheap trinkets either."
Ani C,52 contributions,Jul 2018,clean.  good sand and surf.  location is good and parking for scooter.  food handy. hawkers leave you alone.  recommend. 
Adam S,12 contributions,Jul 2018,"Brilliant large fine sandy beach where you can come to see the famous sunsets. Though you can swim, the waves make it conducive for surfing. Great for people watching as you relax with a drink in one of the bars or sun lounge hire spots. Great to just walk too."
EricaAnders,10 contributions,Jul 2018,"Lovely wide beach but can get crowded, quite a few people trying to sell you all kinds of products and/or services. "
Feevh,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2018,"Best sunset of Bali! Many different restaurants with good food! We could even watch WK matches on a big screen on the beach! You can rent sun beds and parasols! Furthermore, you can rent surfboards and get surf lessons! It’s a lovely beach and it’s haves everything! "
Shauna F,40 contributions,Jul 2018,Quieter than the main beach if you go north. Plenty of offers of sunbeds and more willing to negotiate. Cafes nearby and a lovely evening vibe with bean bags on the beach!
Dhugh70,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2018,The beach is great for walking along. It us windy which makes it pleasant. I did venture in for a dip but I came out stinking. This may have something to do with sewage system near the beach. There are many hotel restaurants to stop and have a drink or meal.
Krista D,"Gaborone, Botswana",Jun 2018,"I have been coming to Bali on Business for years and one of the trip's highlights is the blissful moments where I can walk the Seminyak beach! Although the sand is not white but more volcanic black it is not as black as other beaches in Bali.  I enjoy the short motor bike ride to the beach where I park it. I then walk for about 45 minutes towards Batu Belig Beach where I dine at Warung Pantai, a superb and very reasonably priced beach restaurant. I enjoy the sunset there, usually order grilled Mahi Mahi with Salad and steamed rice or vegetables spring rolls, fresh squeezed lime juice, have a great cup of Bali Coffee before heading back by night towards Legian beach. At night there are very few people on the beach, it is cool and all the night lights of all the beach venues are so pretty.  The authorities/ residents have really cleaned up the beach a lot and this year I witnessed very little litter in spite of the fact that by day there are people in abundance. Walking the beach at different times you will see the hoards of sunbathers by day, resident expats walking their dogs, children playing, oldies walking, local balinese with their families, people making offerings, people doing yoga, brides and grooms having photo shoots on horseback or in the waves....you will see so much as you walk this beach.  Depending on the time of the day the sea will also have a different beauty...sometimes calm & blue, in the evening navy blue with golden  reflections of the sunset, all the spray of the rolling waves catching the beautiful sundown rays."
605jacintam,7 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach along the Anantara stretch is quieter, less crowded. You can walk for miles with the waves just kissing your feet and the wind blowing. Not much bother here from people peddling their wares."
coralreef59,"Berkhamsted, UK",Jun 2018,"Seminyak beach is probably one of the best I have ever seen. There is miles of golden sand and clear blue water.It seems to be quite popular for surf boarding and we saw people having lessons.There are quite a lot of beach clubs spread out along the beach all serving food and drinks. We ate and had drinks at a very relaxing beach club (the name escapes me) which was on 'potato head' beach. There were bean bags parasols, a small swimming pool with a children's area and a dining area. This place was so chilling, it was hard to leave.The sunsets on this beach are beautiful."
ferspratt,"Seattle, WA",May 2018,"Walked to this beach everyday while in Bali. Visited during early morning for less crowded, but sunset was a great time to visit and share a cocktail."
Wish M,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"Bali my favorite place on this earth, I’m feeling so happy and relax, take your time and have a great holiday"
Marlucia2015,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jul 2018,"I liked the food very much and the waitress kartika is so nice , it’s a really good Indonesian food."
Sean H,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"I tried hard to ignore the plastic Bags, rubbish and pollution but there’s so much. The locals just don’t seem to care which is such a shame.Apart from that it’s a good place, there’s bars for Africa in the Legian area and overall it’s a good spot. I just wish the local govt would clean it up!!! "
RachelIddon,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2018,"Great waves, huge pull out to sea though so you have to be really careful with younger children. Cheap rental of sun loungers and surf boards. One warning if you buy anything from one of the beach seller's do it from a fixed one (there's plenty of little stalls) other wise they will all not leave you alone, we felt quite harassed at one point and we just all got in the sea to hide lol!! "
Just Sonia P,"Isle of Man, UK",Jul 2018,"a little cafe 20 min walk from beach , i thought name was Canteen as the wifi password was this. its not the clean canteen restaurant its a small wooden seating area cafe. lady run it she from Tawain, she stole from us & over charged 3 times the actual.priceworst place in seminyak so AVOID here or youl be robbed. cafe is within the streets on my upload"
Dolo999,Solugh,Jul 2018,Great beach for activities like surfing. A lot of boards to rent and teachers who can show you surfing. Not expensive. Great bars and restaurants where you can hide if you have enough of sun and buy some cold drinks and cocktails. Great place for sunset view and chilling with live music every night. Really highly recommended. 
Lily S,5 contributions,Jul 2018,"A highlight of my trip to Bali would have to be having sunset drinks on Seminyak Beach. The live music, comfy beanbags and good location are amazing. The beach has an assortment of restaurants catering for everyone.The beach itself is quite nice. The surf is popular and many tourists hire day beds on the beach. I would recommend a visit to Seminyak Beach!"
romerroow,18 contributions,Jul 2018,Pay for 50k for long chair seing sunset is not expensive at all..Love the beach!! Can do menicure and hair do with local people 😊
donliew,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2018,"The entrance of this beach is right next to Ku De Ta Club. Rental of twin deck chairs is Rp. 100,000 for 1 hour or Rp. 150,000 for 2 hours."
sssssssk,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2017,Nice beach to walk.  Some people do surf and body board.  Water is gray.  Lots of seller come but don’t bother once refused.
Zoe W,"Birmingham, UK",Jul 2018,This is the perfect place to watch the sun go down. It is very popular with locals and tourists alike and you can see why. It is clean and very pleasant and perfect for a stroll
Lovise S,17 contributions,Jul 2018,Good for chilling on the beach while enjoying the sun. The water was cold and a lot of waves. Close to some good restaurantes and the shops
Frida A,6 contributions,Jul 2018,"Seminyak beach is a one of the best beaches in Bali. The beach is one of the cleanest in Bali so the water is good not slot of garbage in the water! Nice waves and good for beginner surfers. The negative thing is that some of the people who wanna rent sun beads (especially the ones near the entrance to the beach) will try to take over prices like 100 k for one sun bead but if you walk a bit further you can get one for 50 k. There are also people who will try to sell things to you, some of them are nice and will take no for an answer and some won't and can get rude and nasty with you (especially men who try selling you paintings, don't know why)."
Andrew C,"Geelong, Australia",Jul 2018,"OK, you're in Bali, of course you want to visit the beach. Well, once you've arrived and ""experienced"" the local culture (ie the incessant touting for business by every stall-holder, vendor, taxi, massage parlour and anything else that can make a dollar, you might think the beach offers a degree of solace. Think again. You are accosted by sun-lounge and umbrella renters, surf lessons and personal services, some of a VERY intimate nature and all along a beach that whilst comprising of sand that is, in places, blacker than most (after all, this is a volcanic island), does contain a fair amount of rubbish, so watch your step!"
Daniel J,15 contributions,Jul 2018,"Visited the beach all most each day , it’s a great place to relax and unwind or go for a long stroll, you can also learn to surf which for someone who has never tried was a bonus. This is not the type of beach you would expect as it is a surf beach and the waves are quite high but it was impressive seeing the surfers catch wave after wave. There are places to eat along the beach but never tried any so can not really comment on them.  We used the beach to walk back to our hotel fromBoth Kuta and Seminyak square .The down side was lots of dogs running wild doing what dogs do and lots of hawkers selling souvenirs but guess they are only trying to make a living. "
Phil B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Two streams pouring their fetid bile onto the beach makes you think twice about going for a swim. And then there is the rubbish, plastic, dropped and ignored. While hotel staff meticulously sweep  fallen leaves, plastic chaos reigns but metres from their doors.  Change will only come when tourists fly over Bali or the powerful demand change"
MichelleESydney,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2018,This visit to Bali we found the water clean and as usual and beach user friendly we as a family had surfers and a young child so we used the beach to surf morning walks and runs along the beach 
Sandy851,"North Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Unfortunately this volcanic ash beach is terrible. There is dirt flowing down tiny little streams from building sites to the ocean. The ocean itself is not clean and if you happen to put your toes in and think the water looks clean, just view it from on high from a hotel room and you will see the pollution. The surf is dangerous with huge currents."
Luke T,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2018,"This beach is out of this world. Stunning views, clean, great selection of sun beds which are also reasonably priced. Only beach we visited in Bali simply for the fact we were so in love the moment we found it."
SMYTHTRIBE,"Perth, Australia",May 2018,We always at least once a trip visit the beach for a late afternoon walk! Generally the tide is out and it’s less busy. The kids love looking for hermit crabs and splashing about in the shallows.This trip the beach was cleaner than we’ve ever seen and we got watch a beautiful wedding. Plenty of places to grab a beanbag and a drink and meal! 
goddessofwisdom,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2018,The water was clear the weather beautiful. So many fish and crabs and water pools. A delight to relax.  
Rajesh C,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jun 2018,"For someone from Chennai, this beach wasn’t something to write home about. Pretty small beach. Short walk to the sea. Can become dirty. Didn’t seem like a place for offshore activities - these are in other places in Bali. OK for just relaxing and sitting in the sand. Quite frankly, found nothing of interest in the beach. Which is both good and bad in its own ways. "
Ellac10,"West Yorkshire, UK",Jun 2018,"The beach is huge, so it doesn’t feel crowded even when it’s busy. However, the sea is very choppy and not recommended for swimming in! Good for surfers and some nice restaurants!"
paceinyourface,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2018,"Tepid Indian ocean crashing onto the long sandy beach, always a pleasure.  Sure it's busy, but it's fun and relaxed.  Plenty to do and to look at.  Need to be a little mindful of the rip ...but it's well marked.  A great, fun and safe beach!"
Sonica A,55 contributions,Jun 2018,Wish there were shacks with food and drinks... we could spent longer time there. It is possibly the most beautiful beach we saw!
Vlad GR,"Chisinau, Moldova",Jun 2018,"I saw the pictures and reviews for this beach which in reality is nothing like this, it’s and average beach and if you will get lucky you will be able to swim, i was unlucky, good for surfers."
sabrina s,18 contributions,Jun 2018,beach drink sun nice vibes... all in one place: seminyak! you find the best hotel and place to eat there and wide nice beach. each restaurant has a very comfy puff chair where you can order food drink or only chill! they put some nice music around 5 that makes everything more exciting .i loved it!
jtaylor946,"Guangzhou, China",Jun 2018,"We came here a few times during our 6 day stay in Seminyak. It’s a great place to relax and watch the sunset. I enjoyed body surfing here as the waves get pretty big and the current is strong. However, you need to be careful; especially if you are not a strong swimmer. My boyfriend ended up in the hospital after nearly drowning when he went body surfing. "
Vickster,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jun 2018,"Not the best beach I've ever seen, but it was a great place to watch the sunset. The beach is a hive of activity during the day with beach chairs and umbrellas as far as the eye can see, surfing lessons, beach bars and beach sellers. If you like walking do yourself a favour and walk along the beach to Legian rather than taxi. It far quicker and way more pleasant 😎"
kaiwen_leow,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2018,Absolutely gorgeous during sunset. Just be there at least half an hour before so you’ve ample time to take photos of the sun setting plus do some shopping from the peddlers at the beach - some lovely necklaces and bracelets.
Geir P,3 contributions,Jun 2018,This is the right place to be if you need good food and a drink or more 👍A lot of bags to relaxe on too
483paulan,"Illovo, South Africa",Oct 2017,Wonderful place to rest and relax after an emotional journey to Jakarta and other sites in Bali. Found a nice spot and rented and all-day bed at the beach to rest and relax with a good book.  Food comes to you and the beauty parlours as well. But it is never when you want to have their services. Quite annoying to have vendors hoovering around you until you purchase something and they are happy to leave. But others follow.... 
Pennart,"Dunbogan, Australia",Jun 2018,"Seminyak beach is littered with trash. We went here to beach comb and walk what we hoped was a beautiful Balinese beach. Within metres of stepping onto the beach you are surrounded by plastic of every type,dead animals, syringes and all manner of garbage.  What humans have done to this place is shameful and dangerous. I'd gladly pay a little more in an entry tax if it to be used to clean the beaches. Do not go and certainly don't take children to the beach. "
janehJ1516EJ,2 contributions,Jun 2018,Great barbe corn and Bintang.  Nice walk on beach taco van outside flash hotel.quieter than legian and easier to walk to through nice shops
mnicolas,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"The beach is nice if you like sandy beaches that don’t dive off into the deep end too soon! It’s a good long stretch of about 5 or 6KM making it ideal to make long beach walks on.It is however incredibly busy and polluted here and there where you see dirty water coming from inland go out to see on a few spots near Canggu and Seminyak too.It makes it not so nice to swim in unless you are a long wat out from the pour out points, it smells there too!The water and the waves are very nice though to boogie board or surf on. For swimming be careful with the strong currents as they can be deceptive. You will see red flags with do not swim advice and it’s best to heed them.Lounging and relaxing on the many café’s and bars along the beach is particularly nice close to sunset!"
veronika papp,"Chichester, UK",Jun 2018,"nice beach which was short walk from our villa, i saw that you can rent chairs or cabanas and buy drink, the waves are quite big and we prefared the beach club"
Zannaone,21 contributions,Jun 2018,"This was the best spot for enjoying the water.The sand was pure and the beach was clean, but a bit crowded.We absolutely loved the water here. Small, but intense waves makes it great fun in the water for playing, swimming or even surfing.So far this is one of the best beaches we've seen in Bali.The beach is pretty lively, if you don't like the crowds, you won't enjoy it."
PPranav1980,49 contributions,Jun 2018,"Gets v crowded at times. Post 10 am is betterMany surfing schools - didn't try this time but on my list for next tripThe F&B on beach is avg, better to go elsewhere"
matsa58,"Sollentuna, Sweden",Apr 2018,Several good places to eat and drink on the beach. Several excellent hotels with different type of services to be used. Service people cleaning the beach all day long.
Claire R,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2018,"Visited for a special birthday.Beach is fab, the waves are great fun. The traffic in Seminyak is unrelenting, whatever the time there is coming start flurry of scooters and cars through the narrow streets which makes journeys long.The people are friendly everywhere and all times felt very safe. Lots to see and do and as everywhere is resonably priced all the family can participate in lots of activities. If you want a relaxing holiday though this isn’t the area to stay!!!! "
tanveer1987,"Chennai (Madras), India",Jan 2018,We went to this beach around evening time. The beach looked deserted and not particularly clean. We spent 10-15 mins here and returned. The journey back was fun as the entire stretch has eateries and massage parlors
ikhajuria,"Udhampur, India",Jan 2018,"Excellent beach to be ..!!! Must goNice and comfy sunbeds ,Good waves to surf .January was a perfect month to be their..."
Nancy S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,One of the nicest beach to visit in Bali. Good place to chill while waiting for sunset with many cafes near the beach.
widyalin,"Mildura, Australia",Jun 2018,"Either just sitting all day on the beach or going there specially to watch sunset,you might want to bring a book with you to make it much better. love it"
jean_leemans,"Antwerp, Belgium",May 2018,Every night the beach was very crowded. The sunset is wonderful.At day it's a surfer's paradise. Loved that beach!
Heather J,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2018,We stayed for 2 weeks 12 minutes walk away from the beach at Kudeta Beach Club. Each time we came out on the beach it did not cease to amaze. We walked in the shallows most mornings and evenings and it was clean....so much cleaner than the very public beach of Kuta (Legian) which we did once at the end of our stay. In Seminyak there seem to be more expatriates who live in the area and try to keep this beach clean. One would see them walking along picking up bits of rubbish (not that there ever was that much to pick up). I enjoyed the beach at low and high tide and anywhere in between. Also the beach sellers (which we met near sunset) are a friendly bunch.
matthewoliver0101,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"Seminyak beach is unlike any other beach. It is clean, and well taken care of, and there were many unique places to go to enjoy the view of the sea."
223jennim,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"It is a lovely beach for a stroll of a evening, it is not so crowded and always a friendly face. it is a beautiful beach."
brandon_hughes,"San Francisco, CA",May 2018,"Even with a little rain one morning it was great to people watch before or after it is crowded.  Some friendly faces, playful dogs, horizon views and a gentle breeze are all par of the enjoyment."
AndrewYew,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2018,The beach is beautiful but increasingly there is more trash. Generally there is less touts here than Kuta Beach. There are more and more restaurants at the beach nowadays.
Tim M,"Wakefield, UK",Jun 2018,"A great beach for a long walk! Spoiled a little by litter is some places (and the odd broken bottle) but a great beach for walking, paddling or just sitting and sunbathing. Some places to try out surfing and overall the beach is reasonably quiet"
Shirley6352016,"Birmingham, UK",May 2018,"We visited this beach twice and, while it was good for sunbathing, the waves were very strong so we were not able to swim. It was great for surfers !"
xilouie,"London, UK",Jun 2018,We are appalled at the lack of respect that people have for what drives people to Bali island in the first place.  My wife and I spent 3 hours picking up debris of the beach rather than swimming.  We found syringes / diapers/ plastic bottles / wrappers/straws etc...  A young lady was sunbathing next to a dead rat and didn’t even know it.  I hope that tourist and locals can all leave the beach in better care than when they arrive.  It’s a beautiful place but needs tighter controls in managing this national treasure!  
ultimatelife1,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2018,"We love coming to this beach, as it is quieter, not so many hookers!  Good lounges to rent.  Fantastic beach, one of the most popular.  Absolutely amazing sun sets."
Nancy S,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2018,Walks by the beach here is a must! And don't miss out the beautiful sunsets. They are the most beautiful sunsets that I have ever seen. 
eatsleeptraveller,"Central Russia, Russia",Jun 2018,"Nice beach for swim and relax with white sandy, cool for sunset. A lots of restaurants and hotel surrounding to visit and stay. Worth to visit and so fresh air"
Akil H,"London, UK",Jun 2018,"Really nice beach, you pretty much have to order and pay for a sun bed to enjoy though because the sand isn't deep enough to lay a towel down on"
Junteng 63,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2018,"We rent a tent with 2 chairs and the price are 300k IDR. We manage to nego it to 150k IDR. Beach with nice view and windy. In Bali , u have to visit the beach"
Intoshmac,"Maitland, Australia",May 2018,Nice clean beach. Not overcrowded . Lots of restaurants to get food or drinks. Lots of umberellas and lounges for only $10 a day. Great value . Not many sellers on the beach.
JoaoG-Bali,Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo-Guerrero,May 2018,"Amazing cocktails at the beach and seeing people walking by at sunset time. The vibes here are amazing, you can def feel the happiness in people!"
Leanne K,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2018,"Loads of places to eat and drink along the beach, most places have free wifi. The surf is rough, the beach is clean! Some people say its dirty but Ive been told it may look like that because of the black sand. Great spot to eatch the sunset at 6pm."
Jessica C,11 contributions,Apr 2018,"Hawkers aren't too aggressive here, and while vendors have established price cartels, you can knock 5,000 rupiah (about 50 Aussie cents) off a 30,000 beer on the sand."
Paul S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2018,Great beach for walking running in the morning. There is not much chance of getting a good walk or run on the pavements in Seminyak. But this beach provides great access to a run to Kuta(10km) turnaround. Just be prepared to get your feet wet
supneet,"Manchester, UK",May 2018,"Nice food, loud music... only till 12pm, food served till 12pm. But they do allow u to enjoy the beach on their sandbags till whenever u want .... fresh air and the night beach walk is what I loved about Bali "
Jenny S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"A very huge beach with white sands that easy for swimming or just walking along. Lots of sitting area for rent paid to the locals, no place to change or clean up though. The best way is to stay at hotels that offer beach club and shuttle, or even better in front of the beach"
TMBom,"Mumbai, India",May 2018,"After The Jimbaran, Seminyak was the next best beach we experienced. As I mentioned earlier also that if you plan to stay in Seminyak you must stay at the beach front or close to the beach. It is a very lively area , shopping pubs and restaurants: nice place the stay and move around "
David F,38 contributions,May 2018,"A bit dirty and overcrowded. Came here for a long walk and to watch the sunset on a beachbag. If you're staying in Seminyak, I recommend coming for one day but then hiring a driver to take you to other prettier, cleaner beaches. "
sofy,Indonesia,Mar 2018,Best beach with wonderful sunset. Me and friend enjoy the sunset at la panca which is good and delicious food
The Anxious Traveller,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2018,"Seminyak beach is a nice beach but not amazing by any means. Expect black sand though . You can get cheap cold bintang from the guys at the top and rent beach chairs for 100,000 rupiah . There are many sellers up and down the beach . Wasn’t to busy in the month of May . "
Alyshia L,"York, UK",May 2018,Lovely beach but you can not swim on most of it. Sea is generally quite rough and dangerous. Lots of people selling things such as fake glasses and bags. Lots of little huts to purchase drinks. 
Disha V,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Jan 2018,"Not your typical ""relaxing"" beach. It's a typical city beach. Pricy, dirty but with good dining options."

Graeme R,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",May 2018,Great place to finish the day.Plenty of entertainment and characters. Sunsets are postcard quality.Plenty of options from blankets to bean bags or day beds to relax on  with drinks and friends.  
JojoBreda,"Breda, The Netherlands",May 2018,Beaches are not the most beautiful in Bali but for sunset it's a must do to sit on one of the many bean bags and watch the sunset.Bit cloudy yesterday
PratikDShah,mumbai,May 2018,One of the good beaches on the offer in Bali while they have many. overall the beach is good to hangout during the day expecially for the couple.
Emma Hamel,"Montreal, Canada",May 2018,"A lot of bar and restaurants around beach side, good place to see the sunset and have a beach walk, different than Kuta beach that has to many vendors, must visit while in Seminyak Bali."
Evyenia W,30 contributions,May 2018,We tried to catch a sunset but it wasn’t much- the kids had fun running along the beach! Lots of cool restaurants and bars. 
AzianMatey,"Subic Bay Freeport Zone, Philippines",Apr 2018,Seminyak Beach is a long stretch of grey sandy beach situated in an upscale and private neighbourhood thats famous for its fabulous sunsets....
spuggy_10,"Peterlee, UK",Oct 2017,"beach is not the  cleanest, water can be very rough, but warm when you can use it, no facilities on beach for food/drink etc but can be bought not too far away."
Travelswithmyfriends,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,I had read the reviews for Seminyak beach but was pleasantly surprised. The water was lovely to swim in although caution is needed as the waves can be quite strong and only a small section is partrolled. Beach beds and umbrellas can be hired and cold drinks also on offer at reasonable prices. Most of the sun beds belong to the upmarket hotels along the beach.  A few hawkers but they are not particularly aggressive. The sand was clean and free of litter. The occasional horse rider along the foreshore is a real treat. Beautiful place to pass the time and watch the sunset. 
Debbie O,9 contributions,May 2018,Lovely well kept beach with lots of amenities.  Sunbed hire cheaper if u walk up to double six part of beach. 
CazzieCakes,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2018,"Asia and Seminyak Beach in this instance is drowning in plastic and it is disturbing as it is disgraceful.If your happy to swim amongst plastic straws, food wrappers, plastic tubes from toothpaste to skin bleaching cream I could not recommend this beach highly enough:( Bali has lost it for me as the pollution is now out of control.The lack of infrastructure and us bargain hunting holiday hounds have taken its toll.I’ve been going to Bali for 30 years and seen it go from sublime to submerged.What a shame :( "
Imogen S,14 contributions,May 2018,"I prefer being here in the late afternoon/evenings, just to sit and watch the world go by, happy on a beanbag, I also bought some cute treats from sellers here! I didn’t swim, but it’s just so relaxed. My fave location on the beach is the b9b bar :)"
KenSSnavely,"Los Angeles, CA",May 2018,"Seminyak Beach is great for walking in either direction. Surf lessons, not crowded, great photo opportunities, the Bali clouds as a back drop. And sunsets are a time for people to gather and take lots of photos. "
David S,"Bendigo, Australia",May 2018,Plenty of places to eat or you can just stroll the beach and watch the sunset. Plenty of hawkers trying to sell you many things that you possibly don't need but it adds to the atmosphere. Visit the beach for a sunset if you have the time.
friedrice4,"Paynesville, Australia",May 2018,"Spent 7 days in the area, we enjoyed Legian beach much better, more lounges, friendlier bar owners, music playing with much better atmosphere. Seminyak beach had darker sand than Kuta and Legian and also had fresh water drains flowing into the sea, this may be the reason for the darker sand. Much more enjoyable at Legian and only a short walk down the beach."
Baz M,"Calgary, Canada",May 2018,We stayed at the Marriott which was very good but the streets are busy and noisy. The restaurants are a bit rough but down on the beach is really nice.The peddlers get really tiresome.We won't go back to Seminyak but at least we saw it and it was good way to start to our 3 week vacation. Go to Ubud instead.
Riggerswollongong,"Wollongong, Australia",May 2018,The beach itself is quite littered with cigarette bits and general rubbish. It's a great location with plenty of bars and restaurants right in the beach and a really good vibe. 
Dinks599,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"Great beach for all of the family if you like waves , which my 3 kids do. Plenty of  sun lounges to chose from for a cheap price.Don't pay anymore then IDR100,000 for two lounge beds. That's about Aud $10.00 ( Aud$5.00 each lounge.)Cool drinks not far away and plenty of shopping options passing you by ( literally 😃).  Sandy beach and very clean.They also have flags set up showing were its safe to swim."
Peter,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",May 2018,"It is a beach.The sea is most of the times to dangerous to swim in.Surfing yes.A lot of trendy places to have a drink, lay down, some have a pool.Very nice warungs for local food, not expensive.Popular is watching the sunset.Sitting on the beach on a beanbag. "
xrs1976,"Hobart, Australia",May 2018,Went to Potato Head beach club and watched the sunset. Drinks were about average Australian price. Great atmosphere! 
Rod P,"Redcliffe, Australia",May 2018,"Whilst the sand is not pure white by any means, this beach is cleaned daily and all rubbish (if any) removed. Deck chairs abound, and when the surf is “up”, it is ideal for surfing."
Stanleyctan,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2018,The beach is too busy and crowded. Prefer Nusa dua & jimbaran better. Tried the water sports and that was it. 
Christine G,"Deux-Sevres, France",Apr 2018,Long stretch of good sand.  Sea is not generally recommended for swimming due to the surf waves but there are some safer areas under surveillance. Fabulous sunsets .
Joslyn Gardiner,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2018,"The beach at Seminyak is black sand, small waves and lots of rips.  However, it is an amazing place to watch the sun go down, to sip on a cocktail or two or simply lounge around on a very comfortable bean bag.  You have to visit, so go between 4 and 7pm... the most action and great for people watching! "
Oldboganbull,"Pambula, Australia",May 2018,"Very safe surf beach, clean by Bali standards but water quality not the best. A great place to watch the sunset whilst enjoying a cold and very cheap Bintang from a bean bag and having a neck and foot massage. The street / beach sellers are everywhere but not too aggressive and it’s fun to barter with them ( you can offer low prices without offending them) and sometimes pick up a real bargain. If you frequent the same “hosts” on a regular basis they will treat you like royalty and remember you for years. Certainly safe for all the family."
blue_wahine,"Redondo Beach, CA",May 2018,"When you walk through the entrance, past the parking area, and over the bridge, there are women who try to sell sarongs and bracelets.  I have no use for both, so I did not purchase any.There was even a man selling canvas unframed paintings for 800,000 Rupiah, which he claimed he painted and “used to have a shop” in Seminyak, but he sold it.  Beautiful beach to watch the waves, and lay out.  I rented a beach chair and umbrella for 50,000 Rupiah ($3.50 USD) which was a deal, as when I was in the Caribbean, the Beach Chair and Umbrella rental was $25 USD and you must order expensive food off their Menu, like a $15 cocktail and $25 hamburger, so this was a bargain.I was there about 11:00am, with hardly anyone on the beach.  An hour before Sunset, many people were coming to the beach. Kids playing soccer on the sand. Everyone there to watch the sunset.  I probably had about 3 different vendors come up to try to sell, but none were persistent. I politely said no, and they walked away.Beautiful Sunset views."
Tambonz,"Waipu, New Zealand",May 2018,However the street hawkers on the beach do spoil it a bit .... Beer ? Chair? Jewellery? Sunglasses? Rings ? etc
GeoffC5,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2018,"The beach sand is grey with dirt, but still really popular at sunset, with the beach crowded, especially on the week-end and around Full Moon time"
Lindsay P,"Tauranga, New Zealand",May 2018,"A large expansive beach which has a very gentle gradient into the sea. Excellent for families to swim or those that do not like large wave activity. Can get very busy with many holiday makers enjoying the area. Lots of people surfing ( or trying to ) which was at time a good laugh. The beach was relatively clean with very little rubbish which was pleasing to see. The hawkers weren't bad, a few of them, but no trouble. A very good beach to relax at."
Nat C,28 contributions,Mar 2018,"Walked off a hangover whilst my friend slept hers off!! Very nice clean beach. I didn’t get harassed much by the sellers, there were lots of surf lessons available, restaurants and bars were set slightly back from the beach so as to not ruin the peace! "
Sara L,"Leamington Spa, UK",May 2018,"It's a beach, it is clean and ad you'd expect has a good selection of lounger for the day. 50,000 seems to be the going rate. Some do towel hire too.The hawkers are there but not intrusive.  You will pay a bit of a premium for drinks the closer you are to the big hotels but the warungs rather than the beach huts offer better value and reasonable food. Try cantina to the right of W. Has a decent toilet too.Watch the current, it is strong and swim only where there is a lifeguard.  "
Di B,26 contributions,May 2018,"It is lovely being near the beach and viewing it from restaurant decks etc but I did not like being on the beach so much. We are spoilt in Australia, beautiful white sand so the dark colour was a little strange. I did not enjoy swimming as there was quite a bit of rubbish in the water"
Gary B,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,nice beach to chill and plenty of places to get a drink or food . water sometimes a bit rough but clean and surf ok if thats what you want or hire surf boards even lessons available 
ShellsBellz,"Wilmslow, UK",May 2018,"Visited here April / May 18, and was pretty disappointed.  The sea is very rough and no good for swimming.  There was a lot of rubbish washed up on the beach. In our 10 day stay we only went to this beach once as the visit did not inspire us to come back for a 2nd visit. In fact struggled to find a beach in Bali that impressed us....can't beat the Caribbean for me!"
Kevin V,"Albany, Australia",Mar 2018,Nice beach to watch the sun go down. Can get a bit polluted throughout the year. Too many hawkers pushing their wares. Wouldn’t swim here...but that’s just me. 
ranjeetspecial,163 contributions,Apr 2018,Seminyak beach is ahead of Kuta and Legian beach and have some of the world's top hotels with private beaches. I stayed on Legian beach area and used to run every morning to Seminyak beach.
pvs867,"London, UK",Apr 2018,We stayed close to the beach at Petitenget and found it refreshingly uncrowned with huge stretches of lovely sand. My Partner lives to body board and the waves here were perfect for this
Barbara L,12 contributions,May 2018,"Great sand beach: take surflessons, buy fresh coconut drink, surfboards for rent.Relax ia only thing you have to do."
Andrea  P,San Diego,Apr 2018,"Maybe it is because I live close to the beach in Southern California that I was so disappointed, but without any emotions and just being realistic about what I saw - the beach is full of trash, rough sand and huge crowds. The beach side hotels are a turn-off, much better to stay away and close to Eat Street. I would not put a foot into that water."
Berenice N,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018,"With a couple of Bintang Beers and spicy burgers, we relaxed on comfortable cushions with other travellers, tourists and families and enjoyed the lively music provided by a variety of musicians. One of the pleasurable experiences, after eating and shopping, that is on offer in beautiful Seminyak, Bali."
buddyrogers32,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,A magnificent place to swim Mostly very clean ocean If torrential down pour then the sewerage can infiltrate the water - not good at allIt’s a tropical island though Very peaceful Waves perfect Well policed with surf life savers No sharks No jelly fish Have fun and enjoy the morning walks at 6 sunrise with all the tourists and locals and families 
MrsLudlow,Fort McMurray,Apr 2018,"Seminyak beach has the potential to be one of the best beaches in the world- but I was shocked at the amount of garbage and litter. It was truly heartbreaking to see- also almost all of the bars, restaurants and vendors on and near the beach use plastic straws, plastic bags and single use cups which is absolutely insane given the state of the beach. They should really put a ban on plastics in the area and put an effort in to clean the beach up. "
James S,"Sapcote, UK",Apr 2018,"Really liked this beach, was beautiful and peaceful.Not too busy or too many posers about.Some lovely vendors to, if you give them a chance and get talking to them.The sea was good fun, big waves but felt safe mucking about. 👍Tasty snacks and cold beers available just over the bridge 👍This was the section of beach by a temple and the mexicola bar "
madre&padre,Montenegro,Apr 2018,Good sandy beach with waves. Many restaurant and beach bar is on the beach. Beach is hughe and not crowded. You can hire or find for free sunbeds and umbrella (if you order drink from beach bar)
Cityboytraveller,"London, UK",Apr 2018,Good destination for a few days if passing through. Local government together with hotels needs to try to tackle the issue otherwise people will stop coming.
James K,9 contributions,Apr 2018,"The beach at Seminyak is much preferable than Kuta. Seminyak is a bit quieter and the people who are at Seminyak seem more international and discerning. The gentle rolling waves are ideal for beginner surfers and it is also good for swimming. Just a shame a bit the bits of plastic floating in the waters. Really sad to see. I picked up them myself and disposed of them in the rubbish bin and so did a few other tourists. If we all do that at the beaches in Bali, we can try to beat the plastic pollution problem.Oh, the sunsets at Seminyak are a sight to behold! Grab a bean bag and a drink and drink it all in."
jbmb1982,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,"Pleasant beach for a walk . Cleaner than we were expecting. Over-all  worth a visit but unless you like big crowds on bean bags and constant interruption by touts, you will probably only visit once.Cafes and bars dearer that in town and not as good. We went once for a daytime walk , and once for a sunset. After that , we had no reason to return.Its a personal choice."
Mishmashoflife,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2018,"This place has views that are priceless however the beach was dirty and rubbish blowing all around you, people constantly badgering you selling their items was a pain and not the best place we felt for safety. View yes beach no it was nasty ,who goes to a beach to pick a spot sitting there with rubbish at the side of them. We chose here for our wedding vow renewal and were very disappointed, don’t bank on this place for a wedding shot there is so much better places then here in the hills by the rice fields Bali struggles at best.We had to clear rubbish first as there was no gaps on the beach as there was already rubbish there and strangely enough a person came along to pick it up removed leaves from the trees that had fallen on the beach and left the rubbish go figure very odd. The view yes but just to get this shot alone yep we had to turn in to rubbish collectors before our wedding vow renewal not ideal but we had flown so far it was poor to say the least not a great start for a special day. "
K D,"London, UK",Apr 2018,Loved this beach. It has a nice vibe to it. It’s peaceful and the sunset is amazing. Colourful and unique. 
JR_Essex,"Chelmsford, UK",Apr 2018,"This is a great beach for walking however it is not without problems, mainly cleanliness. Most of this comes from offshore so is difficult to control and the hotels try and clean their part. The other issue is dogs messing on the beach. In Bali dogs are free to roam and you have to treed carefully. Sunsets are fantastic however."
Richard B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,"Seminyak Beach is particularly great in the afternoons as the day cools as it can be a bit of a hot place, don't get me wrong you can hire lounge chairs and umbrellas, cool drinks are never to far away. I particularly like the beach for it's beach break and good surf, I surfed Ku De Ta (in front of) and Seminyak beach in from of the temple, both spots are equally as good, most prefer to surf in front of Ku De Ta. Seminyak beach is extremely  popular at sunset as the view is breathtaking. At night time the restaurants and bars along the foreshore have bands and live music. There is always a buzz of life at Seminyak beach from the colourful people selling their wares, offering massages and all the beautiful life interactions. Definitely a place to visit and relax at.."
Clark Kenneth,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"i call this So-So Beach, because for me its already to crowded and it's make the sea water become dirty, but the view was Amazing when we chill and 'sunset-ing' "
Gastronoman61,"New York City, NY",Mar 2018,Dont understand what tourists see in this foul smelling and overcrowded beach. THis used to be a great spot 20 years ago but has deteriorated to such a point that I wouldn't even walk my dog there. One can see seweage water being pumped onto the beaches and frankly some of the worst eateries and bars in the area. Stay away if you're looking for a white sandy beach.
Taufik N,Indonesia,Apr 2018,"Seminyak Beach reckoned as best place to enjoy sunset. It is the same coast as Kuta Beach with wider sand bed line for evening walk. thin sea water over the sand create wide mirror effect. during visit it was bit cloudy, yet still able to got few minutes of sparkling golden sunset before covered by lower cloud."
ahmed a,50 contributions,Apr 2018,Amazing sunset view can be witnessed from there..Close to city centerAlwys busy placeMust go place
annabelle54321,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2018,"Good beach Good for boogie boarding but strong under current so swim near life guardsLots of places to hire beach beds, boogie boards and surfboards Bars all along which aren't as cheap as other places but the sunset view is worth the few extra dollars per beer"
Gladiator-Joe,"Kuta, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"Seminyak beach is a great place to swim, surf and most of all watch the sunset. There are a number of bars that have live music on the beach, recorded music and you can chill out sitting on a bean bag, drink Bintang (or any grog you like) and watch the sunset.Great for singles, couples and families. A must to visit when in Bali, in particular the most popular outdoor spot is La Plancha. Get the at least an hour before sunset. The only negative is the non-stop approaches by street vendors trying to sell you anything from paintings to hats. Just in gnome them and enjoy the location. They soon will leave you alone."
kurt J,New Zealand,Apr 2018,"Came here to watch the sunset. The beach is full of people, DJs, live music, merchant sellers, multiple beach venues with alot of hotels having little beach clubs. Find a spot and enjoy it on beanbags and table service.Time your moment and you can have that perfect beach sunset photo."
Steve,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2018,"My wife and I were at a wedding at a beach resort, beautiful sunset, but there are no golden sands, its nothing like our beaches in Australia!"
kashimastarlet,"Ubud, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"A nice black sand beach, beautifully maintained. I hung at the hotels pool and later ventured down to the beach to relax in the sand during sunset. This is not a beach for relaxing and swimming. It has a long shoreline and beautiful waves. The lifeguards are very active and the beach goes on for miles!"
Shaun T,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Apr 2018,We had a great stay at the White Colonial Villa in Seminyak. We were here last 10 years ago and wow has it developed but in a positive way. Definitely trying to keep class and an identity. Really enjoyed being in the hustle but being able to hide and chill out in the villa. 
Jagmeet S,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2018,a short walk from Seminiyak main street off KU DE TA .Disappointing as rather smelly and water is dirty.OK for a quick photo session but not earth shattering s it is hyped to be.
Germaine T,Malaysia,Apr 2018,"We came here two days in a row just for the sunset, best time to start at the beach is about 17.15pm local time where the sun is not too blinding to walk down the beach. And subset is about 19.00ish.. during the month we were here which was April, there wasn’t any large crowd at all so it was peaceful according to our driver the peak season is from May onwards. The beach was huge, lush sands but mirky water of course. Don’t expect blue or crystal clear waters.. lots of happy dogs running freely at the beach. Only thing that was a turn off was there was a dirty river of water flowing from one of the hotels in the middle of the beach straight down into the beach waters. It was so smelly and awful sight that the hotel’s dirty water was flowing towards the beach waters. You wouldn’t miss walking through it as it is a huge opening of water flowing down through the beach. But just don’t think of it and it will be fine!"
gavinpinion,"Warrington, UK",Apr 2018,"The sunsets on Seminyak beach are amazing! The sea is calm with an occasional wave the surfers try to catch. The off-putting smell of the surface water running from the village is a little off-putting at times if you are walking the length of the beach. There are some fantastic restaurants and bars along the edge of the shore. If you are getting around by taxi be careful - please ensure you use a ‘blue bird taxi’ and ask for the meter to be put on. The taxi fare from one end of the town to the other is approximately £1 - £2. Other cabs try to copy the blue bird company by calling themselves ‘blue biro’, of ‘blue taxi’ but they are very very expensive."
Yagneshster,"Ahmedabad, India",Apr 2018,I visited this beach yesterday and im happy to write that you must visit this beach. Beach is clean and has a splendid sunset view in the evening
travelbug733,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2018,"As always here the water is polluted with rubbish, feacies, the beach is polluted with rubbish. It’s packed with drunk tourists who piss in the sand. There are several homeless wild uncared for starving dogs roaming the beach it’s very upsetting. If you are on the beach or at a beach bar you will be constantly harassed by hawkers trying to sell you things so it’s definitely not peaceful or relaxing. They sell lasers to anyone so there are tourists shining lasers up at planes flying in and into other peoples eyes and also poor dogs eyes. I stop a few kids from doing that and told them off their parents were blind drunk and careless.surfs okay you can catch great waves early morning and view some nice sun sets in the arvo. See for you self."
bibiranum,"Garut, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"4.30pm just perfect, u have 1.5 hours to swim, playing with the sands and waves a little bit and watch sunset with ur fam. "
Tech B,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2017,"This is a nice beach to relax and rest and enjoy the beauty of the sunset. The beach was very clean and nice , kids enjoyed lot."
Paul v,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Apr 2018,"All people are relaxing at the beach club, but if you just put down your towel it is perfect.Clean, nice water and yes a lot of hawkers but hee sometimes you need to eat and drink :-)"
The Walking Critic,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"I go to Bali a lot and yes, you can get rubbish washed up all the beaches but not this time. Spotlessly clean, quiet and a great place to hang out and suck up the Bali vibe. There is ample to do from lazing around to surfing. "
karan,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2018,A very quiet scenic and clean beach. Sea beds etc are available on rent for those who wish to use and enjoy it.  
UpInTheAir23,San Francisco,Apr 2018,I went to this beach the first week of April and it was nice! no plastics or trash on the beach as others wrote. I was on the part of the beach right in front of the Potato Head Beach Club. I would definitely go back and the sunsets are amazing.
Islam M,10 contributions,Apr 2018,It is one of beautiful and quite places to watch both sunrise and sunset. Good place for beginners to learn surfing.Nice and cheap food and drinks provide by the small restaurants on the beach side . 
natasha r,"Emersons Green, UK",May 2017,This beach was lovely that had a turtle sanctuary on the beach which was fantastic...there are little ice cooler box bars which are very welcoming one in particular was one called jimmys bar which has free WiFi which is always a bonus...all in all great experience. 
cirque,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"Not as crowded as Doublesix but Seminyak beach is the place to go for quiet time enjoying yourself basking under the sun, you can also view some surfing activities too. "
Kat S,"Bairnsdale, Australia",Apr 2018,"We ventured to Seminyak beach like all tourists to see the Sunset. The Sunset was stunning, so worth it. The beach itself is dirty... rubbish from people everywhere - did not swim at this beach. Brown dirt sand with rubbish sitting on the shoreline. Same at Legian and Kuta all the way along that coastline. Such a shame this place is marred by rubbish from human use."
Pricie1,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Apr 2018,Do yourself a favour and call Made when you holidaying in Bali. Best driver we have ever had and we have been a few times now. Made speaks great English and knows the areas and customs / history very well. Made has many contacts in Bali so is a wealth of knowledge. Easy to contact through messenger so organising all our transport requirements was a breeze. Thanks Made! I have taken a photo of Made’s business card for your reference. 
venonsim,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2018,Nice Beach with stunning view! Definitely a must visit for anyone of any purpose. Sunrise or sunset is a must to see. 
Na Tone,42 contributions,Apr 2018,I’ll give it 3 stars because it’s nice to hang out but there are better beaches to go. With clear water and white sand for example. 
andyst81,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2018,"This beach at sunset is a real highlight of Seminyak. There are a lot of people, but the vibe is super chilled and there are some really nice places to sit, eat and drink.A must do at least once for everyone in the area."
donnat_11,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2018,A little disappointed with Seminyak Beach after Kuta.  No chairs on beach or options to have a cool drink while you watch the sun set.  Every man and his dog there.  Nothing spectacular about the sand or the water.  Creek running into the beach made for a not-very-pleasant ambiance.
burygirlkeeper,"Bury, UK",Apr 2018,"Lovely warm clean water, opportunity to hire sun loungers and surf boards. Lots of bars and good music, cheap and expensive food options."
tonysprings,hartlepool,Apr 2018,Lovely beach to walk along and lay on but always barter for a sunbed. Very clean and good for swimming or surfing....well worth a visit...
Kaehto,Singapore,Mar 2018,"While I agree that this could be a beautiful beach to watch sunsets - this is the definition of dirty... Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. All you ever dreamt of in terms of plastic waste is available, yoghurt cups, plastic bags, syringes. And of course many other things like bottles etc. More than high time that local authoritiues (""guided"" by the Tourism stakeholders) take decisive action."
vazr2016,"Lisbon, Portugal",Apr 2018,"Specially between October and March this beach is very dirty, full of locals selling things and eating. It’s not a good beach to catch sun "
Tania P,18 contributions,Apr 2018,Beautiful sunset at Seminyak beach. Plenty of restaurants and bars along the beach. You can grab a drink at la plancha and watch the sunset.
Maya Renoir,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018,"There is so many little bar around this beach it is amazing. It s cheap and you can find live music as well. Less busy than Kuta which is good. Perfect place to relax and have a bintang, "
craigeyles62,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,Without doubt the best food I have eaten anywhere in the world and what about that sunset over the Indian Ocean
chattam2013,"Canberra, Australia",Apr 2018,Beautiful walk along the beach in the mid morning whilst the tide was out.  Lots of bars and cafes on the beach with plenty of seating and umbrellas.  
Will H,27 contributions,Apr 2018,"If you like beaches and have the slightest bit of humanity DO NOT GO HERE!!The beaches are disgusting you can not see the sand through the garbage! Like i said in previous posts i travel world wide with work and see much poorer places then Indonesia but I have never seen so much plastic on a beach in my life, it was heart breaking to see!If you like hippy/back packing vibes them come here, otherwise stay clear it’s disgusting, no culture no nothing as offensive as this is to say, tourists (mainly Australians) have done what the British have done to parts of Spain, ruined it!If you like culture and history move around Bali, yes it fine to be based here but you need to travel around"
Jon S,16 contributions,Apr 2018,Awesome place to go for a run while in Bali! At times it can be hard to find a place to run in Bali by this beach is perfect ! 
Patricia S,158 contributions,Mar 2018,"We stayed in Seminyak, I love the hotel where we stayed, loved that the beach is a great place to watch the sunset but....the water is sooooo dirty. I didn’t even want to get my feet wet. I love the beach, but the water was so dirty I just swam in the hotel’s pool which I normally won’t do because I prefer saltwater."
dfect24,"London, UK",Apr 2018,"Firstly I’d like to say the surrounding bars and rental places are all really nice, friendly and very affordable. It’s just a huge shame that the swell of the sea seems to accumulate so much rubbish onto the beach. Surfing wise it’s great for beginners, lots of long white water waves to practise on and get your rhythm. It’s nice, but there’s far nicer beaches around Bali."
Jacquie B,"Neutral Bay, Australia",Apr 2018,Although the locals rake up the mess everyday the beach is dirty. I would not take my grandchild in the water there. The sunsets are fabulous but the sand is black. 
Peter T,35 contributions,Apr 2018,A nice beach with a lot of bean-bag bars. We went here one night to see the sunset. Truly amazing. A must-do when in Semniak. Not sure how the beach is during daytime. Not the cleanest beach in Bali. 
LauraDragon,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,"The beach has potential but the garbage it is a turn off. The water is blue, the weather incredible, the sand good and then you see the waist and you want to run away! "
Annaexe,"Manchester, UK",Apr 2018,"Not a kind of beach you’d go to enjoy during the day neither for tanning nor for walking, but it was nice to watch sunset from the bars nearby "
hopefulalice,"Hope, Canada",Mar 2018,"I was super excited to spend a week in Seminyak - until I hit the beach. Disappointing! Garbage is everywhere (if ANY country wants to know we need to ban plastic bottles, go to this beach!) - dogs run the beach (and with dogs comes excrement) - and it was very crowded. I did not enjoy swimming in garbage nor could I stomach walking around so much waste. It is so sad. Such beauty being destroyed by so much trash. If you are a beach person, or just enjoy a clean area, AVOID THIS BEACH!"
Judyannechan,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"The sand is darkish, very fine & it sticks to you. Our hotel had a water tap to rinse your feet off before walking further.  In front of our hotel, the Alila, the beach was clean & you did not get pestered to buy things.  The waves were quite high when we were there, the red flags were up.  Yes, there are noisey Clubs which can disturb the peace of the beach.  I guess it depends on where you are on the beach.  The sunsets are indeed beautiful.  I found that early mornings on the beach were nice."
syams_arief,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"SEMINYAK BEACH not really into my fav beach in bali. Nowdays this beach too dirty to swim, sometime you will find the trash from visitor who visited there. "
Maharsh S,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2018,"Okay to maybe spend an hour or so sipping a beer at this beach. It is not very clean and very crowded generally. It is a regular beach with no real beauty as such to enjoy. When it comes to Bali, there are far many, many more beaches that are much better."
Michael A,"Istanbul, Turkey",Apr 2018,Plastic everywhere. In the evening singers on the various bars bellow to out be heard adding to the chaos. 
Rohit S,2 contributions,Feb 2018,"This is one of the clean beaches in Bali . There are various cafes and restaurants in the vicinity and on the beach. Many hotels and small shops also adjoin the area . One will find peace , luxury and privacy at the same time here. "
slippery35,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,"There is nothing better  than kicking back on a beanbag, sipping a cocktail and watching the sun go down."
Natalie C,"London, UK",Mar 2018,Lovely beach to walk down. Good views of the sunset but a shame about all the rubbish that was strewn about. 
Kurt K,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2018,I had very minimal expectations when I arrived in Bali. The condition of the beaches are disgusting to say the least. Don't expect a lovely holiday sun baking on the sand! 
Jane-Louise B,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2018,This beach has to have the best sunsets anywhere.  Each night there were different colours and its great to watch from the beachside cafes with a drink in your hand.  Take  heaps of photos as the colours are amazing
Julie L,27 contributions,Apr 2018,"I love that place sinces years, that’s why I would like to highlight the fact that Moreno and more plastic is found on the beach... not a big news but I hope things will change for the best. First time I was going with a kid and to be honest it s not the best side of the island to go if you w not to go on the beach, the waves are too strong."
TimandVal,"Berwick, Australia",Oct 2017,"Seminyak beach.It's a beach.It's darker sand due to volcanic activity It sticks to youThere are facilities at various points but not well managed.The food is ok at various points if you like pizza.At night there are bands playing and comfy places to sit which is the highlight.You can sit on it, it's a beach.For once I preferred the pool which I don't very often do.  Can't put my finger on why, perhaps it was a little too grungy, and I like grungy.Better beaches;CreteCorfuFrankstonWhitsundayHamilton islandLake PattersonBondiCarrum Kos- kardamena Zante.The list goes on.....  it was a pretty average beach I feel."
Kinnjall,6 contributions,Mar 2018,Must visit once during your stay in seminyak or Kuta. Nice place to spend your evening. Should reach there by 5.30 to enjoy sunset. Have a couple if drinks there by beach. I love it. 
Phil1999,U.K.,Apr 2018,Don't bother filthy dirty piles of rubbish stinking stream only seen one please worse that was India what a shame went to bech club instead.
Huntley U,59 contributions,Mar 2018,"We had some drinks in La Plancha while watching the sunset and i also did my early morning walk in double six beach. I walked for 45 mins and i saw garbage ( plastic cups, straws, cans, toothpaste case, toothbrush, pet bottles and cover, rubber sandals ...) all over the beach. "
Holly,"Vancouver, Canada",Mar 2018,"I wanted to love this beach, I almost always choose the ocean over a swimming pool. Our hotel was directly in front of it, but I opted for the hotel pool 100% of the time for swimming & relaxing. I loved watching the surfing and everyone enjoying the water, but there was so much plastic and garbage on the beach it was unfortunate and made me not want to spend much timethere. It was certainly pretty from afar & very popular with locals and tourists alike. "
SJKcat,"London, UK",Mar 2018,"We have visited Seminyak beach and were really horrified by how dirty it is and the amount of plastic all over the beach. It’s so upsetting to see piles of plastic all over the shore. I just wanted to pick it all up, but there is so much everywhere  it would not have made a difference. There are some lovely bars to watch the sunset from, however the view is ruined by the amount of plastic everywhere all around you.We didn’t ever see anyone cleaning up the plastic at any point. We have seen many beautiful clean beaches in other parts of the world so this was a real shock. I would not visit this beach whilst it is in this mess.Something seriously needs to be done about this situation and the poor environment :("
Belle C,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Mar 2018,The beach has black sand and has quite a lot of rubbish on it. There is also rubbish I. The sea and it is very choppy so not good for swimming but good for surfing 
Danny C,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Mar 2018,"Sadly the beach has been used and not maintained, the rubbish is piled at the back of the beach and the sea is full of old plastic bags etc and who knows what else. The sufers seem to like it due to the high waves but for general swiming and bathing i would advise to choose another location. I also think the locals and goverment could do more to help clean up the beach and surrounding areas. We moved on after a short stay and will not be returning."
vanness77,37 contributions,Mar 2018,I usually go to the beach club but walking along the Seminyak beach is a great experience for me. Better come in July-August though. 
Kellie G,"Hobart, Australia",Mar 2018,"I've been here a few times, and while I love the little beach cafes and seeing lots of people walking and the locals, it's not a beach I would swim in. There's a lot of rubbish along the waterline. Dogs doing their business in the water... Pretty at night with the cafes and beach seating, well worth the look. Great for long beach walks. Lots of swim schools, but again, I wouldn't swim in the water. "
sashasen,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2018,I used to visit the Seminyak beach especially the private beach of Marriott ... the beach is clean and so is the water ... something that cannot be said about its counterparts in Kuta ... it is not tio crowded unlike Kuta and Legian and has a classy feel to it ... Overall a nice experience !
Man571,"Hyderabad, India",Mar 2018,"We spent about 4 hours during sunset at Double dix beach . Beach is great with medium waves for kids .   Lots of bars and restaurants on the beach , they offer bean bags to relax  while eating with live music and flood lighting right until midnight . "
travelerFlorida_USA,"Pompano Beach, FL",Mar 2018,"The beach in Seminyak was a bit disappointed as although sandy the water was not very clear and the beach had a lot of debris around. We were told the beach is cleaned every morning and the plastic bottles, wrappers and other debris is brought in by the current. Every afternoon, people gather at the beach to watch the sunset. There are many bars and music. The big is quite long. "
MihiAHerbert,"Gosford, Australia",Mar 2018,Our experience at Seminyak beach was good. Friendly people offering you a Bintang and surfing lessons.
Freddy S,"Terrigal, Australia",Mar 2018,Great spot to sit in bean bagd and watch sunset whilst drinking Bintangs.Only down side is rubbish left on beach
Dagalong,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,The night life on the beach is amazing.  The food was great and the atmosphere impossible to fault with all that goes on.
Kaztravels74,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2018,"Walked from very clean Double 6 to main Seminyak and it was filthy, covered in rubbish and barely anyone on the beach. We couldn’t get off quick enough and the taps we found next to the beach weren’t working (to wash our feet). Yuck. No vendors selling their wares on the beach either, that says something."
Laura L,20 contributions,Mar 2018,"You just can’t keep up with the Indian Ocean trash, but they give an average effort. Lots of nightlife and live music. Many offerings for dinning and spas. Average shopping. "
saifudin122,2 contributions,Mar 2018,Having good times. Sunset very good spot. Many cafe and good restaurant surround. Facility was quite good especially if you are in anantara hotel or alila hotel. 
Theodor111,"Zurich, Switzerland",Mar 2018,sunset is great very dirty beach. lot of plastics and other garbage. water not clean as well.panorama is nice
JonNewport,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,We walk along this beach most mornings and enjoy the surf and fresh air. Fir the most part the beach is clean but after a high tide it may get a bit messy. There are a lot of spots these days where Balinese are keeping it clean and it is certainly better than it used to be.
Stu B,328 contributions,Mar 2018,"We visited for the sunset for a few times whilst in Seminyak: the colour of the sky is beautiful! Not a great beach for sunbathing during the day as the sand is incredibly hot and the beach is covered in litter. Indonesia really does have a plastic pollution problem which ruins the feel of the beach. I've yet to find a good beach in Bali which is a shame. That aside, check out the sunshine. Plenty of bars to sit in or bean bags to sit on and enjoy the view "
Sushobhan M,36 contributions,Mar 2018,"We went there last week as soon as we landed in Bali.The beach is really relaxing and clean, perfect for a beach run or beach walk. Drink prices around the beach are quite reasonable with beer costing around 25000rp which is around 2 dollars. If you are a keen surfer, they also offer surf lessons and beach looks perfect for surfing. "
StevieB10,"Macclesfield, UK",Mar 2018,"Miles of sandy beach, waves big enough to surf, just idyllic 🏄🏼‍♂️🏊🏼‍♀️ absolutely deserted last Saturday on Bali's Day of Silence and Hindu New Year in Indonesia. Happy New Year!  "
Elaine,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Finding a place to dine by the beach with some acoustic live music? Then you will love Seminyak like we do. My BF and I visited the beach for 4 consecutive nights at the same beach side stall for their amazing view, and live music. Stalls were set up on the beach itself , facing the sea and bean bag chairs were lay out with a table for dinning makes it even more relaxing. The staff were really friendly too."
224elmarp,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"While the kids really enjoy the stroll at the beach, collecting seashells and catching small crab, I cant help to notice the abundance of plastic rubbish on the beach. What a pity, hopefully the plastic usage can be reduced throughout the world and Bali specifically to avoid further damage to the environment. "
anubhavwashere,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Mar 2018,Perfect for walks and relaxing. Just few steps from Courtyard Marriott hotel. Very happening place compare to other beaches in Bali.
Quirky L,4 contributions,Mar 2018,The beach was nice not to crowded not to noisy but there was a lot of garbage on the beach. It ruined the experience for us.
Rob A,"South Yorkshire, UK",Mar 2018,"Looks great from afar. Once there you'll see wandering dogs taking a dump in the sea, litter and trash washed onto the sand from sea. Hassle galore from garbage sellers on the sand. Pretty much sums it up. Oh the water is lovely and warm. Just has dog dump in it among other things. "
Lord P,2 contributions,Mar 2018,Very worth while to visit lively beach great for surfing people friendly and relaxed. Super sun sets 
Danielle S,8 contributions,Mar 2018,Seminyak Beach was probably beautiful once.  But not anymore.  An early morning walk will reveal the beach and waters edge completely...yes completely...covered in plastic trash debris.  The poor labourers from beachfront posh hotels and the odd restaurant try valiantly to rake up this rubbish before the punters arrive expecting clean sand.  It is thoroughly depressing. An environmental catastrophy.  The walk behind the beachside cafes stinks and is full of litter.  As always the Balinese people are friendly and upbeat but how long can we all go on pretending this place is anything other than a polluted and ruined once-was-paradise.
mdilk,"Wakefield, UK",Mar 2018,Found a nice place to sit and watch the sunset sat on beanbags watching the sun go down a great experience 
Pernille Spang R,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Mar 2018,"Lots of people and sooooo many sales people wanting to sell you bracelets, massage, etc. The beach chairs are pretty expensive compared to other beaches on the island. "
Kadek A,7 contributions,Mar 2018,"Nice beach with white sands but still need improvement to do with their facilities.  Surrounding by world famous hotel,  great villas and some amazing beach clubs in the world,  seminyak beach has popular tourist destination. The sunset also spectacular from here. Try hang out from one of the beach clubs around here and you will amaze with amazing vibes. "
Mark D,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2018,Seminyak Beach is a lot quieter than Kuta or even Legian..... beautiful place for a stroll first thing in the morning or late of an afternoon to watch the sunset.
Thomas,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2018,This is a nice part of the beaches here. There's always plenty surfers to watch when you're relaxing in one of the relaxed beachfront restaurants here. A good spot to spend a nice lazy day but also a spot where you can get all the exercise you can handle. Sometimes it can get a little busy but most of the time it's just outside of the main crowd to offer a relaxed spot.
jaceka49,"Jacksonville, FL",Feb 2018,The beach itself is very nice and there are a lot of restaurant and resorts on the beach. I often go to beach to enjoy the sunset.
anton10186,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"The sun set is owesome.  The beach is near many hotel ,.  I was not able to enjoy since the beach is dirty.  Many garbage from the visitor.   As visitor . We must come and go without leave something in the beach.  "
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"Seminyak beach is black sand beach and the sea is generally clean to swim in.  The best part of the beach is the sunset. As seminyak is on the west part of Bali, you will get spectacular sunsets each day.  There are some restaurants with lots of chairs and lounge for guests to have drinks and watch the sunset. "
Pierre/Mary W,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018,We had the chance to visit the beach at Seminyak. Our biggest surprise was to find the beach covered with rubbish. Plastic everywhere and no one seems to care. I spent one month in 1982 and we called Bali a small paradise. To return there was very disappointing and if nobody care about pollution let’s continue this way and have a great holiday on the communal tip.
Huxter09,"Numurkah, Australia",Mar 2018,"Seminyak beach , a long greyish sand beach with endless swell atm. Not a lot of crowd and like everyone else, we're wondering where all the tourists are . Is Mt Agung and it's low rumbles keeping tourists away ? Suits us as we can have our pick of beach lounges , cold drinks at hand and out three year old grandson to entertain us while his Daddy surfs.Bosrd hire seems cheap but our boy has his one of his own , designed for North Narrabeen but handling Bali's surf beautifully .Horse riding along the beach too and not much sign of the litter problem we'd be warned about . Hazy day but just beautiful and a bit of breeze to cool us down . Perfect "
Jennifer L,1 contribution,Jan 2018,"Clean, good for enjoying your sunday after stress working. I like to come here a lot. never bored seeing the ocean"
TonyCondon,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2018,"A good place to unwind and catch the rays. Beach has vast array of hotels bars and restaurants, covering the whole cost spectrum. From a photograph or seaside pool, is fits the postcard image. The negative is unfortunately the swim in the ocean or walk on the sand where all forms of modern day waste ruin the experience."
Tazim Z,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Feb 2018,"Nothing like laying on a bean bag under a colorful Arabian style umbrella, smoking shisha with catchy loud music in the background and relaxedly enjoying the pre-evening beach breeze and sunset @ Seminyak Beach.Simply awesome!!! 🏖🌄🏊🏻🏂🎼"
Heidi G,"Tromso, Norway",Mar 2018,What a beautiful bechwalk. But no swim - unless you like swimming with plastic litter. But all the beanbag cafees are  soo nice ♡
Priyansh M,"Ahmedabad, India",Feb 2018,"May be it's us, but after visiting beaches at Kuta and Nusa dua, somehow Seminyak was a let down. It's not bad. It's decent infact. But it neither has hustle of Kuta nor the serenity of Nusa dua.. "
gensivalingam,"George Town, Malaysia",Feb 2018,Can be improved more especially cleanliness. safely also can be concern here as very large number of tourist in this place
Vtan888,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2018,Most hotels around seminyak have private beaches. Tend to have strong waves so might not be ideal for swims. Along the seminyak main road there are many restaurant and pubs. Hip and busy so great for a night out.. 
Janice,"Cape Town, South Africa",Feb 2018,"As far as beaches go, this has got to be the worst beach l have ever seen. I was her a year previous and returned to see if it had been cleaned since, it had not.It had raw sewage coming down a river which continues to flow down the river a year later. There were no white horses in the sea but brown horses of sewage. Coming to Bali for this beach would be a big mistake."
Marijka T,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018,I can’t say I have ever seen that much domestic waste being washed up on the beach. It is being cleaned many times during the day but not great to go in the sea. 
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,Once beautiful Bali is now the most polluted island in the world with its water literally thick with rubbish of all types. Nappies and bags and all sorts of disgusting items wrap around your face if your foolish enough to swim in it.  This beach and its waters are literally toxic and J advise you not to swim at the beach. It smells and the rubbish piles high on the sand.
tarmigan50,"Norwich, UK",Feb 2018,If you want a beach holiday dont go here the beaches are disgusting litter everywhere. People say they try to clear it up but im sorry if you want tourists to come here you need to try harder. It is not good for an island the rely on tourism. Please tell me why i would want to pay to sit on your sunbeds surrounded by rubbish get a rake and a bin bag and clear it up PLEASE. Its such a shame as the rest of the island is beautiful. Go to Sanur sunbeds half the price and no rubbish.
Sam B,"London, UK",Feb 2018,"The place is so dirty I don't know how anyone can want to come here! We stayed in Seminyak for 4 nights thinking it would be a beach holiday but we took one look at the beach and we couldn't understand how this place is advertised as a beach destination.The waves are so high and rough you cannot swim in the sea, and the sand has so much rubbish it's disgusting. Poor wildlife! Such a shame. Even large 5 star resort hotels didn't seem to care to clean up the patch of sand that their hotels overlook.We ended up sending the 4 nights in Seminyak around a pool. Will not be returning."
team l,2 contributions,Feb 2018,"Plastic Rubbish can be seen EVERYWHERE. Worst part is, smelly water from sewage directly goes to the ocean water; no pipe is used, water flows to the sand and then to the ocean. So disgusting. Very disappointing."
jotage2017,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,Beautiful shore line and sandy beach but extremely dirty please wear shoes as their is broken glass and rubbish everywhere 
Kylie S,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2018,"You will find the beach has black sand and accommodates many bars & restaurants There is no escaping beach sellers, with sarongs, paintings and other trinkets with thier well rehearsed ""I give you good deal"" The beach is littered with rubbish, broken glass and other not so friendly beach items.During the day its hot, with some what rough conditions.The beach offers direct walking access to Kuta in the south, or Potato Head in the north.At night the beach comes alive with bean bags, colourful umbrellas and beach dining.Definitely go explore and make your own decision. For me, its not a swimming beach."
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,We have been a regular visiter to the beach over many years and little has changed. Hawkers in plenty but once you no how to handle them they add to the scene. BINTANG is cold and offered at a cheap price so grab a beer relax and enjoy the sunset.
sydneyloner,sydney,Feb 2018,"I've been to this part of Bali for 5/6 times over the years but I was horrified to see how polluted this beach has become this time. It really has no reason to visit anymore unless the local government acts immediately and strenuously to curb use of plastic packaging on the island. I also found injection needle on the beach but when I handed it to a guy who was cleaning he didn't seem to be too care about what I found, which might reflect such found was nothing unusual. I'll go elsewhere instead of Bali or at least this part of Bali anyway."
Ontheroadagain4648,"Sussex Inlet, Australia",Feb 2018,"I know its popular and well known, but as far as beaches are concerned it is just a beach. There are so many nicer, cleaner and more picturesque beaches in the world...must admit on a nice evening sunset it does look romantic."
ebatancs,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,"Trash everywhere on the beach. Cleaned regularly, but it is just piled up at the back of the beach. Not too bothered by traders hassling. If you don't engage in conversation, they leave you alone."
Adam H,"Redbank Plains, Australia",Feb 2018,An amazing sunset there was not to many persons there on the night we went there i would say a must stop for any person havi g a holiday in bali. Amazing photo opportunities 
Deeyaneeh C,31 contributions,Feb 2018,"Quite disappointed with the beach. It was dirty and trash is on the shore. I didn’t swim and I dare not to swim. Maybe it was because of the weather since it’s wet season but still, they could have done better! "
Jenny,"Rasnov, Romania",Feb 2018,"This is the dirtiest beach I’ve seen in Bali so far. They clean it regularly but still there is a lot of garbage. Good for surfers-beginners. Sand and small waves (white water). No good schools nearby though (at least I haven’t come across). There is a lot of bars on this beach. The ones that are close to the entrance are very expensive, the further the cheaper. There are people trying selling you goods but not a lot of them and they pass if you ignore them. "
julia_le84,"Richland, WA",Feb 2018,"We came in February and it was dirty with trash.  From what we heard, the storm pushed all trash from other islands to the beaches.  So hopefully it will be nicer when you go."
MichelleR1965,"Camberley, UK",Feb 2018,The guys looking after the beds do a great job of clearing what is the dirtiest beach we've been too. So much rubbish coming ashore. I certainly would not swim in the sea. Such a shame as it's such a nice sandy beach
Nyu24,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"Perfect sunset, nice beer and lite bites; the  unbeatable combination. We loved to spend time here until the sun was down. "
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,This is not what you see on the tourism photos. Plastic waste as far as the eye can see. It spoils the beach but it also spoils the harmony. Bali is not a beach paradise with this spoiling it that is for sure.2203
Kevin T,"Hoi An, Vietnam",Feb 2018,"Though it was raining hard this morning, it was a nice walk! There were a bit of rubbish on the beach at some places but it was raining , so guessing all the rubbish are being washed out onto the beach but like I've said it was a very nice walk by the sea 🙂. "
Paul R,United Kingdom,Feb 2018,"First time we went down to the beach, there was a lot of trash on the beach.  Maybe thrown up by some rough seas, but it was a little disconcerting to have to step over it.  Now it appears there has been some effort to clear it up, but some still remains.It didn't impact our stay at all, but worth noting.  Look past that, and it's still beautiful. "
Christian S,"Beijing, China",Feb 2018,Overall Bali is quite dirty. Trash everywhere. The Seminyak and Kuta beach strip is probably the dirtiest beach I’ve ever experienced. There’s much better and cleaner beaches on Bali such as geger beach in Nusa dua or belinga beach.
Blazing P,23 contributions,Feb 2018,I found Seminyak beach a little off putting with so much rubbish washed up along the sand. 😣 Not sure why so many people travel to Bali for the beach life when the jungle is so much more beautiful 🍃
Marian P,4 contributions,Feb 2018,Great beach but at this time was pretty dirty with washed up rubbish - mainly plastic . Have to say the locals were out early morning to clear each day . 
Andy P,50 contributions,Feb 2018,Really disappointed with the cleanliness of the beach.It’s pretty much a rubbish dump for plastic.  It seems to be a bit of an environmental disaster that no one is willing to address.It’s a very depressing beach and not somewhere that is enjoyable to spend time.Bali you need to clean up the environment! 
rinna62,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,Walked along the beach and was so dirtyNot sure if I could ever swim thereThe council needs to do something to improve
roberto,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,compared to kuta beach this is heaven. It is clean and it is cleaned every morning there are heaps of places offering umbrellas and Lounge deck chairs and the umbrellas there are cheap motorbikes and taxis to take you anywhere there are cold drinks and toilets available
tinablueeyes87,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2018,We went for a walk on  Seminyak beach 2 days ago and were horrified to find how filthy and littered with rubbish it was. There is no beauty to this beach and even upon finding Ku De Ta (by mistake) we wouldnt have known it was there as the beach there was still filthy. There was rubbish in piles and mounds everywhere. Will not be back to Scuminyak beach nor will we suggest it to anyone :-(
Takako R,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"We went for a walk along Seminyak beach, and we were not impressed.Rubbish, plastic, bottles everywhere!People were sitting down on the beach and having drinks and dinner right in front of rubbish...Inside of hotels and villas are always kept clean but why don’t they look after their island??  Have seen local people eating food and throwing rubbish after they finish on the street and beaches...Keep your island CLEAN !!"
fmrosealex,"Dublin, Ireland",Feb 2018,"Went here in February and left immediately, but not before paying the extortionate price of 100k for a sun lounger and being harassed by multiple women selling sarongs etc. The beach was filthy, littered in plastic and the sea was full of plastic too - my boyfriend literally came out with food wrappers stuck to his body. The waves were huge but not good for surfing and people were being taken out by the waves even in shallow watwr. The water is warm but it’s warm everywhere else in Bali too so go somewhere else "
JessJake1923,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,Went to Seminyak to check out the beach and got a huge shock the beach was disgusting rubbish piled up all over it We were told it was the weather that caused the rubbish So many plastic bags all washed up we were shocked to see the beach looking like a huge rubbish tip 
carryonabroad,Melb,Jan 2018,"What a tip during this time of year, could not believe our eyes first morning we ventured down to walk the beach rubbish strewn as far as you could see just as many other travellers pics have shown  , INDONESIA get your act together this is disgraceful , we are told  'its all from Java "" due to the stormy weather around this time of year REALLY? . Would not go anywhere near swimming in the ocean on this coast of Bali if you want a cleaner beach try Sanur as this Problem runs from Jimbaran to Seminyak"
Michael P,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada",Jan 2018,"Went for a day during low season (January), when it's said that trade winds wash a fair amount of pollution into the area. The beach itself was filthy - could have used a good cleaning. Did not go into the water. Hawkers everywhere. Just dirty, dirty, dirty - couldn't wait to shower after leaving the place."
Steve G,"Forresters Beach, Australia",Jan 2018,Not the cleanest beach we have seen and be careful not to be run over by the learn to surf groups. Nevertheless the water is cooler than the outside temp and the sunbeds for hire are very comfortable but we did swim one at a time in the surf for fear of losing gear..
ShaunSAFA,"Karratha, Australia",Feb 2018,"We were looking forward to some beach time in the sun. Unfortunately Seminyak beach was covered in trash very very dirty, not impressed."
Russell D,"Hampton, Australia",Feb 2018,The beach looks quite dirty with rubbish collected in piles most mornings.The sand is dark and grainy.We didn't swim as it didn't look clean.Mainly busy on a Sunday as the locals have family gatherings.
kathryn soo,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"This area of beach is better than double six beach. Much cleaner and less rubbish. Also, you can hop into bars for a drink or just for sunset view at any bars around. Come here for chilling by the beach instead of double six beach"
SiddiM,86 contributions,Feb 2018,"This beach has a scenic view , surrounded my multiple shacks but unfortunately not maintained.You see garbage lying all around, shacks aren't clean and hygienic , there were no sea guards.... There were no swings- which is like the usp of Bali ! Overall I suggest can be avoided ! "
Paddy_Snaps,402 contributions,Aug 2017,"Semknyak beach was nice place to go surfing, enjoy sunset or listen to live music in one of the shacks.Good for an early morning jog also - but be careful of the open gutters on the beach. "
den5lb,"Leeds, UK",Feb 2018,"As beaches go the walk from Semiyak, past Legian to Kuta isn’t the most pleasant. The positive: Beach bars galore semiyak end with cheap beer and entertainment at sunset! However if you are specifically describing the beach huge amounts of rubbish wash up, I’ve read on travel blogs this is a problem this time of year but I was surprised at the sheer amount. Every man and his dog wants to teach you to surf however I can imagine there are nicer places to do this. I for one look forward to travelling to more remote locations in search of the white sandy beautiful beaches I without hesitation know exist on this beautiful island. "
ChristineHK,"Sande Municipality, Norway",Jan 2018,Nice beach for surfers or for a walk. High waves and very windy when we were there. Nice sunset spot. A little messy since it’s rainy season. 
elizabeth m,"Liverpool, UK",Jan 2018,"We were not impressed at all with the beach in Seminyak. The locals told us it was because of the rain and storms which has washed all the rubbish ashore and deposited it in the beach, the place was so dirty and just disappointed."
Linda W,2 contributions,Dec 2017,"We arrived a week ago in nusa dua beach resort was bit priceyBut overall was beautiful now today we arrived in Seminyak at our villa for next 2weeks villa really nice ,made our way to beach Omg what disappointment beach full rubbish even the sea looks dirty no one has never commented on this ,will keep to posted xx"
Donna_Elle,"Manila, Philippines",Jan 2018,"Didn’t stay long as we visited in the late morning and it was hot, hot, hot! The beach was clean though."
LeaFry,"Toowoomba, Australia",Jan 2018,"Seminyak beach is a great place ti spend an evening with friends relaxing on a bean bag sipping drinks, having a nibble and chatting with friends. Great atmephere to just sit back and chill. Music can be loud. Pick your favourite bar and sit back. Enjoy a sunset if there's no cloud. We missed out. 2 weeks of cloud cover. Day time take a swim but expect debri on beach coming in with the tides. Water is warm. Dont expect white sandy beaches as it is dark grey volcanic sand. "
Pilar S,"Mexico City, Mexico",Jan 2018,When I came to Bali I thought I was going to see the most outstanding beachesSeminyak is a nice town the water is warm and people are very friendly
TheCamelot,"Quezon City, Philippines",Jan 2018,"We went here to have some beer at night time and chill. Although it was a windy day, they beach was fine but the water of the beach were too far from the shore, its nice to sit back and relax here while drinking, it wasnt  crowded at all and there were no vendors bugging me unlike in Kuta beach there are too many people forcing us to buy something! but it was a little dirty and its sand was dark grey, unlike in pandawa and padang padang beach which has white sand.. Overall, it was a good place to watch the sunset and relax after a day tour in Bali! 😊👍🏻"
Lisa W,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2018,"Unfortunately, Seminyak beach is completely covered in litter. The water is quite wavy and nice to listen to but isn’t very blue at all either. Won’t be returning to Seminyak. "
happyblender,"Athens, Greece",Aug 2017,"Surfing and relaxing is the best  way of living in holidays.Bali is definitely that place.nice people, full of fruits everywhere.."
Fifi I,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"It was hot day when arriving this beach, the waves was very mesmerizing and its quiet too bcz of less people around. I love to be here, but too bad there were a lot trash like plastic etc between the waves. too bad bcz i was hard to find trash can around the beach. I hope the management of this beach could do something about this. Seriously the only thing tht disturbing on this beach was only trash. "
Cliverd,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,I thought the whole of the beach from Seminyak through to Kuta was very average and with a lot of rubbish washed up on the sand
Dive Master H,"Moorea, French Polynesia",Jan 2018,"I rate this the best beach in Bali for the sunset, and altho there is trash on the beach like every beach here in Bali, this one had the least.  I recommend the part around seminyak square, on up. Potato Head if an amazing place to catch the sunset, with great service. Pictures below are ones I took from Potato Head"
JCTravelLog2016,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"It's tough to write a review for an entire beach. Even tougher to write about a constantly changing thing... so let me paint broad strokes: Seminyak beach is brown-sugar sand that is best experienced May-Oct -- off-shore wind, dry season, sun, surf, hustle&bustle and of course: epic sunsets."
Gio A,"Milan, Italy",Jan 2018,"Useless to say “you’ll be bothered by locals who try to sell you stuff” because that is written in every single review of Bali, get over it, that’s what they do to get money.The beach is BEAUTIFUL, and the best thing I can advice you to do is to go there to watch the sunset, as it really warms your heart."
Graham W,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",Jan 2018,What a mad place we spent new year 2018 here. Fireworks  galore. We loved it.Fireworks for hours we had a ball letting them off
Cynthia,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,1st visit to Bali. Disappointed by the dirty state of the beach. Maybe the heavy rains washed up a lot of rubbish but we didn't swim there at all.
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Jan 2018,Nice wide and sandy beach with magnificent views and tons of rubbish plus some stray dogs roaming around. Lack of basic services like chairs and umbrellas for rent or food stalls. It’s a shame since this place has a lot of potential.
tonithomson5,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,Lots of rubbish in the water. However it’s a pretty beach 🏖 kids enjoyed the few hours we had there. Has life guards !!
Kym P,"Baldivis, Australia",Jan 2018,We finally found it was a bit of a trek it was overcast the day we went and didn’t even get on the beach before a lady spotted us and tried to sell some sarongs.. 
Elly S,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"Seminyak Beach is much quieter than the famous Kuta Beach, a couple of cafes here n there. But there’s not much peddles plying n trying to sell you to buy their items. They are very calm n if you say “No thanks” they will walk away.n leave you to enjoy the view n relax. "
Denis Y,79 contributions,Jan 2018,"Beautiful, fun, friendly wonderful and relaxing, truly this is paradise on earth. I don't know anywhere I would rather be at sunset. "
Anshul S,106 contributions,Oct 2017,"try avoiding this if you want peace and privacy. too many tourists and shutterbugs. however, lots of food joints nearby"
docmh007,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,Not the best place to surf but a great spot to have a dip in without going too far out (major rips) and nice to bodysurf back in
herilee,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Great restaurants surrounded and the white sands surrounded.. It is very good place to enjoy sunset in Bali!
Megan S,Canada,Dec 2017,Beautiful beach with an amazing view of the sunset but unfortunately during monsoon season tonnes of trash and plastic bags get washed up on the beach each morning. The locals are very good at cleaning the beach up from the pollution but it is still an unfortunate occurrence
rsaatlarge,"Birmingham, UK",Dec 2017,"The water is beautiful and the views of the sunset are spectacular.  However, there is way too much garbage on the beach.  And way too many people trying to sell you scarves and jewelry and hats, and do not listen and leave you alone when you say NO. "
Maria F,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,"Seminyak Beach is part of a very long breach that runs from Echo Beach in the North to Kuta in the South. It runs for MANY Kilometres (I'd guess 10Km, at least). The Beach is wide and easy to walk along. Surfing is mainly at the North end (Canggu area). For Western tastes, the Beach is not attractive or inviting. It is a ""dirty"" grey colour and more literally ""dirty"" from a LOT of rubbish on it. There are many areas set-aside for Hotel guests with Sun Shading and deck chairs. these areas are no cleaner, otherwise, the water and beachfront, are available to all. Be prepared to be approached by many vendors! For sun-bathers, the beach, in the Hotel areas, is fine. For Beach-walkers/runners, it's also fine. For Swimmers, it's up to your preference of ""clean"" water."
JohnT61,Sydney,Jan 2018,"I am going to be slightly negative about this beach, unfortunately. I heard a lot about this beach before I went and I was left disappointed. The sunsets, however, were magnificent every evening, but the beach itself was not to my liking. Coming from Australia, where we have such clean and beautiful beaches, I am left to compare my beaches to that standard. Seminyak beach was overcrowded with beach umbrellas and lounges for tourists. I realise this is normal for this time of year (January). But what disappointed me the most was the rubbish. There were tonnes of man-made rubbish scattered along the beach with no attempt by local authorities to clean it up. With the little attempt made by local shopkeepers to clean up, it was stored on the foreshore for the tide to take away. I can only imagine what Kuta beach would have been like.It was certainly a different experience. Seminyak Beach in Bali was unique, but for me, it's a place I really won't return to anytime soon."
chyland,"Uckfield, UK",Dec 2017,"We visited this beach every day in December it was very quiet as it was December. The people were amazing on the beach. The most disappointing thing was the accumulation of rubbish all day long that washed in from the sea. Some of the locals cleared it up first thing and then it was washed in again, a never ending task. It put me off this beach and sea as it seemed very dirty."
Flitz8-A foodie travels,"Athens, Greece",Jan 2018,"There's a lot of eateries along this beach and most go for sunset view along this coast,very busy beach and not cleanest"
Kunal B,"Jaipur, India",Dec 2017,I think the beaches in India are better than this. The beach was absolutely dirty and filthy except in front of the oberoi which they clean themselves. on seeing the beach I wondered why bali is rated so highly as a destination when the beaches are filthy and there is lots of traffic jam
Claudio D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Where to see one of the best sunset in the world?Bali...... At Seminyak beach.So, 5 deserved stars !!!! "
Glamp Bazaar,"New York City, NY",Jan 2018,"This beach is beautiful and has lots of great waves if you're into surfing. Also great if you're a first time surfer they have tons of affordable surfing lessons and the waves are great but not so intense that it's a hard place to learn. There are great little beachfront restaurants and bars, and it's pretty easy to get a lounge chair if you go early enough. Negotiate for it and don't pay more than 50-100K rupiah for 2-3 hours. Sadly, there is a lot of trash on this beach. So walking along the water is not a great experience because you're dodging washed up trash and plastic bags. "
nitemist,"Canberra, Australia",Dec 2017,"Ok straight up here...the beach is horrible.  Why you ask...ill tell you...its polluted with rubbish that gets washed up due to the rainy season or due to tourists leaving waste on the beach.  Every morning we watched locals tirelessly try to remove rubbish, youd come back the next day and it would all start again.  Maybe were spot with our australian beaches and ecpectations that all beaches should look like ours but this was really sad.  Of more concern was that young children were allowed by parents to run tgrough the litter without a care in the world.  I can tell you know there is no way i would tramp through the litter to fet to the water let alone alliw a child too.  I wouldnt even enter the waters on this beach its just not worth it.Its not all gloom though.  Late acternoon tge restarants open up and you can have some great dri ks and meals on yhe beach watching the sunset.  Most cafes have their own music and the food is good (id recommend trying b9b we fou d them the best).  Go have a look at Semenyak beach but dont be mislead by images showing you thats its a pristine haven youll be dissapointed."
Nikita B,33 contributions,Jan 2018,The beach is nice and has a good stretch if you would like to walk. Usually in the evening the tide increases. Couldnt see any lifeguards nor is a beach for swimming as the water did not look very clean. Overall my recommendation would be to chill at the beach clubs/hotel facing the sea and not bother swimming in the sea - use the infinity pools out there. 
Pradnya_Kanekar,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,The beach is not very clean and the food stalls near the beach aren't very hygienic. If you have access to the beach through some villas r resorts then that portion of the beach is a must visit
Naomilee75,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,"So the 5 of us, (hubby and 3 kids and I) went for a walk on the beach around 6pm. The tide was out and all we could see was rubbish. 😪 There was so much rubbish on the beach being washed up, it was really sad to see. There were people everywhere and it just like it was so normal to them. It would be nice to maybe have more bins on the beach and make the locals and tourists aware of how bad it is to litter on the beach. Not only for the looks of the beach but also for the sea life. At breakfast the next day in our resort, I asked the manager if it was ever cleaned. He told me that the beach was cleaned every night. WOW- I was surprised. During that morning, we went for another walk and there was minimal rubbish. (Sadly, it was there again every night, but that did not stop the people coming in. ) The waves 🌊 looked amazing and many people were enjoying themselves surfing, swimming etc. We decided to just swim in the pool instead. The sand in front of The Royal Beach Resort was very grey, not the sand I expected. Nor, was it any good for making Sand Castles. Still a nice view though. 😊This photo is more towards Seminyak where the sand got a better. This was also during the day. "
CuriousTravellerDXB,Dubai,Dec 2017,"Oh Seminyak, your streets in general were so well maintained but the public beach strip was a disgrace. I know that we were there in rainy season and the sea throws up more garbage than usual, but watching the tourist hordes also treat the beach like a dumping ground and only a few bars/hotels making an effort to clean up was extremely disappointing. I've lived and worked in Asia in similarly touristy destinations and this is the worst I've seen in a long time. Friends staying further along the coast had an entirely different experience so that's reassuring but we didn't even swim in the sea because of this. Bali, you are a beautiful island with beautiful people, culture and food. Please don't forget the beaches (and kick the butts of tourist litter louts!)."
Al_21_121,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,NY celebration on Seminyak Beach was a gr8 experience ....we experienced NY eve  on Double six and Seminyak Beach /the fireworxs were Insane a 2 hour build up then @ 00:00 global firworx from all three main beaches Legian Double Six and Seminyak beaches the fireworxs only stoped after 00:45 ....Lively party experience potatoe head beach and Cocoon had a private NY Bash with International DJ 's cover charge was 1.400.000 IDR
Tiaan le Roux,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jan 2018,One on the best beach in Bali. We hand a good time there. You can rent a seat or just enjoy yourself on the sand. Beach was very clean and had a bunch of friendly locals! Great for a bali sunset!
Angelika R,"Leichhardt, Australia",Jan 2018,"Wandered down to the beach with 3 kids, aged 9 and our twin 7 year olds and were skipping over the Rubbish floating in from the beach and swatting away people trying to sell us just about everything. I wouldn’t go back."
David M,Singapore,Jan 2018,"After staying a week at Seminyuk in a villa behind the W hotel, I spent each day walking/running between 8 and 14kms on the beach,The early sunrise views were beautiful, the air clean and fresh and you feel a million dollars when out and walking.The problem is the pollution, there are 3 streams that run onto the beach and the water stinks of sewerage when you walk through these streams. In addition to the water stink was the huge amount of plastic garbage on the beach as well as broken glass , I didn’t feel safe to walk on the beach without shoes on.The Bali and Indonesian government officials need to work out how to reduce the plastic waste and the open sewerage that runs onto the beach, it will really impact the tourists coming over if like me they feel the water is not clean to swim in."
paulaS6563UA,"Colchester, UK",Jan 2018,"Lovely walk along the beach and it was a lot cooler than walking through the town.  Nice hotels, bars and restaurants. Relaxing place."
boozybub,"Cleveland, Australia",Dec 2017,Was only a 10 minute walk from our Villa to Seminyak Beach and we only did it the once. Rubbish on the beach everywhere and to top it off were the two used nappies half buried in the sand. Left immediately and didn't return...chose the cleaner option of the pool in our Villa. Shame.
PetterLundgren,"Nacka, Sweden",Dec 2017,"Fantastic beach, sunset and waves .. but there is a need to clean the beach and water from plastics. That will significantly improve the experience. Long term Bali authorities need to consider this..!! From a Bali lover "
Daniel C,"Kalamazoo, MI",Dec 2017,"There are many resorts near this beach and quite a few restaurants right on the beach with lawn chairs facing the water. There is less trash than on kuta beach, mostly just a little more effort to keep it clean but still trash around. There are a lot of people but it does have nice sunset views and seemed to be a decent surfing spot"
Paul C,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"We stayed at Double Six, with a beach front balcony. The beach is nearly always lively. New Year’s Eve the front street is mayhem, which if you love Bali you’ll be used to!We went to the rooftop club and watched the fireworks along the bay, amazing.The beach it self has a rubbish \ garbage problem, some say due to it being the wet season the garbage is wash down streams into the sea. Early morning groups clean the beach every day, but to no avail as later in the day the garbage is back.The water is murky and you feel garbage washing around you.Some hawkers, but not too pushy.Pricing in bars is on the high side, for Bali.There are nicer beaches in Bali for surfing and relaxing, the area does have a great selection of good restaurants though, and sunsets are good anywhere on the west side of the island."
jawa13,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA",Dec 2017,"I stayed in Seminyak area and went to the beach for a run on around 8:30 AM. What I saw was shocking. The beach is full of rubbish and filth. Never seen a beach this bad even in India. Check out the photos. Clearly, this rubbish was not thrown by the beachgoers. It is washed out from somewhere else. It seems to me that Bal does not have a garbage collection/disposal system so everything ends up in the ocean. There was large cleaning crew with large machines trying to clean up. But whatever they do, all goes back to ocean. I had a very different impression about Bali before I went there. Old historical temples such as Lempuyang Temple are worth a visit, not the seminyak beach. Save time and go somewhere else."
Riebro,"Vaxjo, Sweden",Jan 2018,"Ok, it is the rainy season and it drag a lot of dirt to the beach and in the water. The plus is that you can find your place and the merchants on the beach are few and polite. "
LaurenceLG,"Doha, Qatar",Dec 2017,This is a pleasant place to lie and sunbath.The view is great as well and it is a good place to learn surfing. Yet as there are waves you might prefer another place for a dip.
Damien S,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"The last time that we visited was in 2009....fast forward to 2018 and the place has been cleaned up away from the beach. The restaurants and the shopping areas are not modern and a lot cleaner. The shop keepers do not pester you to purchase, if you want to look and buy then you are able to do so in peace. The beach itself we visited and there was a lot of rubbish on the beach. Given that it was just after New Years Eve this may have be part of the reason. I will be back in the future for sure."
Shannon B,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,My best friend and I went here to celebrate 20 years of friendship! We had an amazing time. Highly recommended. 
Paul S,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"I stay in Seminyak when in Europe it is snowing, raining, etc. I often go to beach to enjoy the sunset. It's always funny"
Leo R,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,I have yet to see this beach in pristine condition. Admittedly there is some attempt to clean up the pile of plastic that stretches the length of the beach but this is only done in the areas which are set back from the waters edge. Moreover the workers use rudimentary equipment are they appear lazy.Depending upon the time of year there can be dangerous rip currents so bathing beach flags should be followed at all times.
Kelly H,29 contributions,Nov 2017,"Heaps of restaurants to choose from, good for a run, massage, nice swimming beach, toilets and shower, surfboard hire $5 an hour ok for beginners. Be prepared to be hassled even when your eating a meal."
David T,116 contributions,Dec 2017,Had higher expectation of the beach but the waters edge was covered in plastic rubbish making it uncertain of what we were walking on and definitely did not make a swim inviting - beach in desperate need of a cleanup
Gill H,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2017,The time we visited the weather was pretty stormy and there were signs warning of rips!  Not a safe place to swim! However walk up to the Westin hotel and have a drink while watching the sunset!  Good people watching Place and nice and relaxing!
Enyele,"Zurich, Switzerland",Dec 2017,The beach itself is truly BEAUTIFULWe surfed there - the waves are perfect for beginners BUT: when we were there the beach and water was full of trash. What a pity. They reacted well and started cleaning right away as it seemed to be bigger problem (trash came apparantly from indonesian mainland/other island)Of course Bali is not alone to blame for this problem - yet truly something needs to be done or Bali will have a big Problem with tourism. 
Matthew C,6 contributions,Dec 2017,"Disgusting beach filled with garbage so sad.  Bali really needs to work on their garbage disposal.  A paradise vacation spot littered with gatbage that constantly washes up on shore, sad 😢"
Monumental333,94 contributions,Dec 2017,The beach can get dirty but the get cleaners to clean it. The nightlife along the beach is buzzing. Alila has a great bar where you can listen to waves crashing. It is magical. Take a stroll on the beach. I did not have a dip but looking at the ocean at this beach was great.
Constance C,China,Dec 2017,"Seminyak Beach has many entry points.  We entered from the Polis Post in Seminyak (you can enter through Ku De Ta too) or one of the villas or hotels facing the beach.  Compared to Kuta Beach, this beach is relatively free of rubbish, water sports touts and people.  It begins to get crowded with people when you are walking on the beach approaching where Ku De Ta Restaurant is.The water sports costs are more expensive too.  In Kuta, you pay 50,000 rupiah per person (after bargaining) for 2 hours of the surf board; but in Seminyak it is 80,000 rupiah per person for 2 hours.   The beach vendors on the beach served better food though.  We did not feel like eating on the beach so we bought some satay (meat on skewers), fried banana pancakes and meatball soup.  The food only cost us 40,000!  The banana pancakes are 2,000 rupiahs each and the meat satay only 1,000 each! Unbelievably true."
AFehlers,"North Riding, South Africa",Dec 2017,As later explained by the locals due to wind and the time of year they experience large amounts of trash on the beach. It was difficult to find decent place to sunbath and swim. 
cerka,"Hastings, New Zealand",Dec 2017,Visited during wet season so the water was brown and the sand was littered in rubbish. We saw a used diaper. Gross.
darlygraham,"Tomar, Portugal",Dec 2017,"Been 3 times for surfing lesson. Myself and my partner learned surfing for about 2 hours each day, easy to rent surf board, we caught huge waves all the time and perfect spot for sunset."
Kalpesh P,82 contributions,Dec 2017,The Seminyak beach is ok types and not among the best ones.I would recommend to goto Padan beach or goto Gili Trawangan island and enjoy beach mood.
bb19872017,"London, UK",Dec 2017,"Luckily, I was staying at the W hotel so I had a great view of the beach. However, parts of the beach is very dirty and I only hoped the locals would clean it up"
Gay B,"Pattaya, Thailand",Dec 2017,Such a disappointment. The beach is guilty! Humans being at fault! Plastic rubbish every where. Beach vendors clean their patch constantly. But the next wave carries in more plastic. The sea is full of it! The beach vibe is good. Safety is managed by surf rescue. Beach beds are really good valve and the beach bars offer a friendly service of food and drink. 
Thelly76,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,We dropped by Seminyak Beach to see what all the fuss is about. Don’t be misled - those sands are far from White. If you’re looking for beaches of an Australian standard - knowing we are incredibly spoiled by beautiful sands and water - head to Nusa Dua Beach instead. 
LouTheShoe,"Leicestershire, UK",Dec 2017,"The beach was beautiful. The sea was quite rough so great for water sports but not so much for swimming. The only downside was the constant hassle from people selling things. If you say “no thank you” they do generally leave you alone. Loungers and parasol available to rent but don’t take the first price, we fell for this on the first day and paid 200k rp for two loungers, on the second day we walked down the beach slightly and paid just 100k. "
KuDeTa,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2017,Seminyak beach is my beach for sport early morning Swimming and surfing on day timeThe best Sunset at 6 pm  by walking on the beach and enjoying 
Lim Ah T,4 contributions,Oct 2017,I know this beach when I stayed at Luna2 hotel because this beach is just 1 minute away from the hotel. It is good beach and good wave. 
bxbats86,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2017,"Unfortunately it's extremely polluted in and out of the water though there are huge efforts to clean the place up. I wouldn't swim here at this time of year, the rains churn up the surf and leave junk everywhere."
Karley67,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2017,"Don’t bother going to the beach here, instead, hire a driver for 600,000 IDR for 8 hours, and head down to Uluwatu for the day where the sand is white and the water clear."
788m_t_t,"Pomaz, Hungary",Dec 2017,"Friendly waves. Normal beach but not the Best. Lot of bars and selling people. Its not a must place, but you can spend few days there.  "
CongiaEnterprises,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,Regrettably tourism has left its mark on the shores of Seminyak. Debris from uncaring tourists is dotted along the shore. 
Chizzel,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2017,"I don't know what has happened in Bali but their beaches are full of rubbish.  It is deep with plastic bags, bottles and general waste in the ocean and especially on the beach.The only thing that made Seminyak beach a bit better is that they had tractors working furious trying to collect it.  Unfortunately as the ocean is full of rubbish, it just kept filling up. Tuban, Kuta and other beaches including Canggu were atrocious as this clean up wasn't happening as well as Seminyak. It really is disgraceful as the only way that much rubbish could be in the ocean is if it was being dumped.At any rate until this gets cleaned up or there dumping practises change I wouldn't  recommend their beaches. This was like this at the start of our holiday and it was just as bad when we left. Shame really."
singhbhavana04,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2017,Not good for people looking for peace or privacy. The beach is dotted with several good restaurants organizing DJ parties or live music.
Janie Low,4 contributions,Dec 2017,The beach was so dirty and the sea water was very dirty too. Wanted to have a tanning session over there but so disappointed when I seen the beach due to the environment there was so bad. It was so much worst than my expectation. 
Ngurah P,1 contribution,Dec 2017,nice beach i love it enjoy holiday if you want holiday in bali you must come to seminyak beach😄😊😉😉
Mark W,"Wallan, Australia",Dec 2017,I don’t think I’ve every seen Seminyak each and Kuta beach so full of rubbish. There were piles of it. Seems that this is the norm during the wet season. The beach was unusable. Rubbish floating in the water as well. 
Vinesh Pikale,"Panjim, India",Dec 2017,Don’t get me wrong it’s a nice beach but I’ve seen far better. The sand is darkish and slightly coarse. Locationally nice. Has good restaurants on it. 
cass_bell17,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2017,Sunset over the water is beautiful however the beach is very dirty with rubbish etc. Did not feel safe having our toddler on the beach. 
djmontano,"Makati, Philippines",Jul 2017,"Coming from a country famed for its white beaches, I found the beaches in Bali unimpressive, the sand is dark and can get rocky. The tide and current can also get quite high so it's not the best for swimming."
adz_702,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2017,Go to the gillis if you want to swim as Seminyak is touristy with dirty beaches and price traps. The Gilli islands are GORGEOUS!
Aeagleaaron,"Phoenix, AZ",Dec 2017,I would say that Bali is not a place to go for beaches. They are very dirty. Well at least this one was. 
Seb L,"Tonbridge, UK",Dec 2017,"Not a swimming beach. Loads of trash in the water and washed up. In the more tourist sections they have loungers and do clear away the rubbish, but we took one look and knew this wasn’t a place to come and sunbathe/relax/swim. Go to a beach club... or a nicer beach."
Roscoe G,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2017,Might just be the time of year but we werent impressed with the beaches around kuta seminyak canggu areas. Not what we'd describe as idyllic or relaxing. Or what ine expects from an island vacation.  Locals were friendly though. 
laho758,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"Amazing sunsets, lots of activity on the beach with live music try to out do each other, lots of bars and beach lounges, too many people trying to see you stuff and lots of rubbish on the beach"
ROSSAtravels,"New York City, NY",Dec 2017,"Thanks to having a private pool at the villa we rented, we didnt have to rely on coming to this beach for swimming and or relaxing... The beach is just okay... Lots of people trying to sell u things which is bothersome... "
Kazm76,"Geelong, Australia",Nov 2017,"Didn’t enjoy this beach as much as one 20 minute walk down in Legian.  Seemed dirtier, sick dogs lying around. The guy to barter for sun lounges and boogie boards much more expensive than Legian and less willing to negotiate. Not as relaxing as Legian. After telling beach vendors ‘no thanks’ they would just ‘hang out’ at your sun lounge. No privacy!"
Philomena2013,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"Seminyak beach is the dirtiest of all that I have been to in Bali e.g. Nusa Dua, Sanur and Kuta.  The beach is littered with plastic bottles and other objects, clothings, slippers, etc. "
WorldTravla7,"Cairns, Australia",Jul 2017,"Seminyak Beach is one of the cleaner and more inviting beaches I’ve visited in Bali (mainland Bali that is, the Gilis and Lombok have amazing beaches) and I enjoyed a few long walks and a swim with family. The surf is good for body boarding and catching waves as well (though don’t drink and swim if you’re inexperienced, my brother had to pull a guy out of the water who could have drowned). The water was nice and I didn’t encounter rubbish like I have before further south at Legian (there was a tiny creek flowing into the ocean to cross which was a bit dirty but that was all) and there weren’t many sellers or hawkers at the section where we stayed (just near Potato Head, Alila & Mrs Sippy bars). If you can get a hotel or villa in this area you’d do well as it’s not too overcrowded and it’s a quality stretch of beach close to some excellent restaurants and bars."
chiragkkatara,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017,This is an amazing beach one of the silent ones which gives you your own space too and never miss the sunset
Elena C,Cyprus,Sep 2017,"Bali is great and Seminyak is full of lovely bars, clubs and restaurants but the beach is nice to view and walk not for swimming."
Tella P,Jakarta,Dec 2017,"I visited this beach few days ago; it's pretty good - the view was awesome for Sunset. You can find some ""jagung bakar"" afterwards."
peter k,Plymouth,Nov 2017,"We went to the beach on two occasionsThe surfers were out on the first time getting some good ridesThe beach barer went to offered cheap lunches of good qualityBeach loungers were available and we paid 100,000 rupiah for two on day 1 and further down the beach 50,000 on day 2 (£6 and £3 respectively)The busier areas further down the beach had an in water rubbish problem"
Luke C,"Issaquah, WA",Nov 2017,Spent 3 days at Seminyak Beach. Went in November when the rain washes trash into the ocean. It was quite dirty. Beach vendors can be a bit pushy as well.
ravifour,"Pearland, TX",Nov 2017,"I love the beach, it's nice on a hot as the water is nice an cool the place is teaming with people, drinks and family and kids playing, great place to enjoy the sunset"
Zoozoo_R,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2017,"The beach is good - a little debris around though, but still not too much. The surf waves here are awesome! Swimming in the waters here is fun - quite shallow waters with huge tides coming in.The cafe shacks on the beach are nice to lounge around in the evenings."
squerpans,22 contributions,Dec 2017,"a very nice beach to wear sunbathing, and a very nice atmosphere for a vacation😊maybe next year I will come back here again, because I am comfortable to be here"
Sebastian K,"Helsinki, Finland",Nov 2017,"Even if there are cleaning crews, the beach is full of plastic, plants  and coconuts at low tide. The problem is not the beach visitors, it's likely coming from all around."
Luis G,"New York City, NY",Dec 2017,Very disappointed to find this beach so full of garbage.  Impossible to swim due to the amount of plastic bags and other things in the water.  The beach it’s also covered with so much garbage and the top of the cream was finding a needle on the shore... shame to all those hotels and bars for not being responsible of cleaning the beach 
miheledom,"Shanghai, China",Nov 2017,Along the beach there are a lot of resort and bars. We enjoy the view while sitting in on of the bars there. It is not that great beach at alll
Jim S,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Nov 2017,"Nice place to view sunset. Plenty of food and drink choices and some with live music. Not the cleanest beach i have visited. Annoying ""chinese lantern"" sales people, why buy these and add to the plastics in the sea."
kevin-ooioo,7 contributions,Dec 2016,"i love the sunset here, actually the beach is not so clean and it is crowded. But if you wanna see people and have some fun it is a good place. But if you looking for a nice and romantic place, then better to go somewhere else"
pkaran,"Pune District, India",Oct 2017,"If you are in Bali then do visit Seminyak beach. It is good long beach and it is neat and clean. There are water sports, beach chairs/beds for rent and several food and beverages options. Before the beach, there is a market street where also many restaurants are there. A day can be spent easily in this area."
Patrick M,"New York City, NY",Nov 2017,"Unless you've never been to a nice beach before, you will surely be disappointed and underwhelmed. The sand is not pretty and the water is not blue. I'm honestly very surprised that Seminyak is such a popular destination. There is absolutely nothing special about the beach there. If you told me I was at a New Jersey beach I would have believed you."
Handoko T,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Seminyak beach is the best beach Bali has, especially the northern side (Batubelig)....it is flat and wide...and moderate waves in the morning. Sunset could be good in clear weather. Very nice for morning walk from Kudeta to Potato Head Club."
예원 김,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2017,"There are a lot of sunbeds around the beach. The prices that owners call are quite high, so make sure you negotiate with them to get a cheaper price."
cafitzy,"Chinchilla, Australia",Nov 2017,It’s a long stretch of sand but there is no white sand & more rubbishy than should ever be present on a beach! It’s an entertaining walk though with a mix of tourists & locals with cold drinks available from beach vendors. The sunsets are apparently amazing but we experienced the start of monsoon weather but watching the storms roll in was pretty special. 
WW’s,"Greater London, UK",Nov 2017,First visit in January 2016 was great. Unfortunately in November 2017 the beach was dirty. Every day. Nobody clean it
Kylie W,"Portsmouth, UK",Nov 2017,I was heartily disappointed at the awful state this beach is in. It’s dirty and covered in rubbish both in the beach and floating. The sea is dark but becomes clearer the further you walk. But if want a scenic view for sun bathing this is not the one! If u want to collect plastic visit 
dordor-Sin,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2017,The beach was just infront of our hotel.   It was a clean beach with lots of sea sports but payable. There are a few hotels with this beach front.  I was staying at Royal Beach Seminyak Bali. 
Francisca-José Cruz Saavedra,"Vina del Mar, Chile",Dec 2016,"Lovely place, it's a big and long beach. Perfrct for surfers but no good to have a nice and calm swimming."
Shamim G,"Durban, South Africa",Nov 2017,I won't trust getting in the water here. Black sand with lots of debris. If you are looking for a good swim head down to Nusa Dua. This place is only suitable for the beachfront cafes and restaurants but not a swim
phoebefeld,"Canberra, Australia",Nov 2017,"Wet Season is around October to March, (ish) at this time Indonesia rains and storms a lot. This brings out all the trash and rubbish and covers the beach in gunk. I was swimming and every wave that came past me I was brushed up by chip packets, plastic wrappers, and so on. The beach itself has barley any motoring which means it could be very dangerous to bring little kids. As I almost got caught it a strong rip, it made me realise there was minimal noticeable life guards or safety plans in place. There are many people on the beach selling you cool nicknacks (strange items). Only issue is they can be very persistent and will not leave you alone until you buy something. I personally felt uncomfortable leaving my bag on the beach while the ladies were lurking around. So I had to stay with my earphones in ignoring them until they finally walked away. "
GRAHAMMMCFARLANE,"Bedford, UK",Nov 2017,Wonderful beach at Seminak - everything you need is there for a great holiday experience - highly recommended.
Shelly M,"Mtunzini, South Africa",Nov 2017,"Our second day on the beach was a real treat, we went left instead of right which wasn't pleasant at all. So do remember to go left from Seminyak onto the beach. Our loungers and umbrella (which we had to pay for) was a saving grace for the day and we had a lovely lunch at the Samaya beach hotel. There are woman who give massages on the beach, and people selling all sorts of goodies. "
charliehill,"North Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,"This beach reminded me a little bit of my home country of Wales UkCloudy skies , dark (almost dirty looking) sand , and the sea didn't look inviting either!The bars with their bean bags and umbrellas were pretty and would have liked to have been there on a dry sunnier day and even for sunset as then this would have been better.Was expecting whiter sands in Bali but not this one. Such a shame , maybe next time it will look better"
Kajalkothari,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2017,"Went to this beach for a stroll in the evening and to enjoy sunset on my first day in Bali. It's definitely got a good footfall, yet clean and serene.  So many shacks line up this beach with colourful bean bags on the beach to sleep and enjoy the view and drinks. The sunset is stunning.  "
Menekag,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2017,"We come from a country which is known for it's beaches yet we enjoyed the Seminyak beach very much. Sea was not very rough, therefore one could just go for a sea bath or just enjoy watching the waves roll in.... It is also a wonderful place to people watch!! Beach was quite full yet we had our own space as well."
Michael W,8 contributions,Oct 2017,A great spot to get a tan and have an icy cold Bintang. You can also learn to surf or even fly a kite. Plenty of people to give you a massage for only a small amount of cash.
Padillalawyer,"San Antonio, TX",Nov 2017,"Great beach if you want to just walk along, as the waves brush against your feet.However, not much in the way of sunbeds or umbrellas."
babesinlove,21 contributions,Nov 2017,We spent two nights here sitting under umbrellas watching the waves roll in whilst lighting laterns and stting them off into the night sky.You can enjoy a cocktail or a meal here while lounging on beanbag chairs or sitting in a restaurant.It was lovely.
kristi20172017,"Vilnius County, Lithuania",Nov 2017,"The beache was much more cleaner than I have imagined! beutiful view, nice colour of water, tendet sand, no any stone at the beache. Was interesting to notice women walking and carrying their goods on heads!;) Just too expensive to rent an umbrella with loungers (it cost for us 200 000 rph for 4 hours- like in West Europe!). "
hyunsuk y,2 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice white sand beach surrounded with a lot of restaurant, great location nearby Bali's Airport, we will come back next year"
hubi61,"Manchester, UK",Nov 2017,"Nice sandy beach, quiet and good for relaxing , but sometimes dirty The atmosphere is very pleasant.If I have time again I will surely go back there"
Alan S,"Kettering, UK",Nov 2017,Fantastic huge clean beach with lots of sun beds everywhere ands loads of cool bars it's the best place on the island to watch the sun go down in paradise 
amandashe,Malaysia,Apr 2017,"The beach is not as famous as other beaches because it has lost its popularity due to cleanliness issue. However, this does not bother me that much. I just wanted to lie down and enjoy a sunset view. Lack of popularity now makes it slightly comfortable because it was not crowded."
Yod538,"Michaelston-y-Fedw, UK",Nov 2017,Great beach. Some traders are a pain. Restaurants on front very nice. Lovely at night. Big range of food and styles with matching budgets. Worth a stay.
OzHershy1,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2017,"The walk from Mr Potato Head beach club to Kuta will take around one hour unless you dally. Do the walks in the morning if you are an early riser to avoid the heat that comes with the sun. Don't forget that you need to walk back.Lovely walk on firm sand and wonderfully pleasant waves lapping at your feet. The walk in the heat of the day will be more strenuous so do wear a sunhat and do coverup and decidedly, slip, slap, slop on the suntan lotion.During the morning, the sun lounges and beach umbrellas appear as people arrive to sun and swin. The beach clubs and beach bars that spread all along the beach will serve drinks and snacks and some even serve breakfast, lunch and dinner. Later in the afternoon, as the heat begins to dissipate, the locals arrive with children and dogs and the appearance of the beach changes. There will be  games of soccer  played near the water, babies will be laughing as the waves lap at their little legs. Lots of pretty girls taking selfies and almost as many couples doing the same. Guys watching the girls and girls watching the boys. The occasional dog believing it is human will lie down in the water and let the waves wash over it. Surfers gliding on the frothy waves and the odd fishing boat out at sea dot the panorama. As the light fades, live music can be heard from beach bars. Singers set up on mini stages with back to the sea face multicoloured bean bags hosting resting locals and tourists sipping drinks, chatting and chilling out. Later, after the music has stopped and the beach goers have gone and went the scene changes yet again. The odd surfer is still out there surfing  the glittering silver sea but the sand is almost deserted except for the odd couple strolling hand in hand. Sun lounges, beach umbrellas and bean bags have been  washed  and put away and only  rubbish remains which like magic, disappears by morning."
KazzaIpswich_Suffolk,"Ipswich, UK",Nov 2017,Lovely beach directly outside our hotel which was fab but there was a river coming into the sea which was full of rubbish. Think the rubbish will be a big problem if they don't do something about it. Ideal for surfers as big waves. 
Jacqui A,5 contributions,Nov 2017,coming from Aus the beaches here dont rate im sorry!  First thing I saw was a dead rate upon entry.  Sunsets are beautiful from a nice resturant
SMcAloon,"Western Ireland, Ireland",Nov 2017,"We didn't spend time lying on the beach here. Unfortunately stray dogs seem to be a real issue in Bali and they roam freely on the beach doing their business where they like with nobody to clean up after them! Not ideal. There was some litter lying about and in the water which was disappointing.This was a big wide beach, with some horse riding and huge waves. I would go back, and maybe spend a day relaxing and swimming."
Craig P,14 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice beach, sand is dark but cleaner and softer than i thought. The kuta beach is dirty and black. Walked and run every day. Very comfortable."
Dj_panda,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Nov 2017,"I like the waves it’s the best black sand and clean with 100,000 rent a chair and enjoy and it’s safe "
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2017,A good view on sunset as the sky turns orange and the beach activity turns into black silhouettes. Plenty of good vantage points. Try not to waste your money at a trendy overpriced bar. Its as if they have a liscence to charge high high prices just because of the free sunset.
Mitesh K,4 contributions,Nov 2017,"Nice, quite beach. Couples & families can enjoy in day having surfing or laid back in sundeck. Rents for sundeck is IRD50k per head , bargain hard then only else price is too high. At Night one can enjoy gud live music/ band played by good performers. Once can have food & drink with lots of options to choose from ."
Kristeen R,2 contributions,Sep 2017,"What more can I say? Just wanted to be there forever. Lovely views and a great place for shopping if you choose to, but not too intimidating. "
Galuh888,29 contributions,Nov 2017,"Wanna come here again and enjoy the romantic sunset, the beach litle bit dirty. An silent after gunung agung issued."
Tartufi3110,"San Francisco, CA",Oct 2017,"The beach is wide, long and beautiful only if you don't look closely. There were dirty nappies, broken glass, piles of dog poop and other sorts of rubbish all over the place. We couldn't let our children walk barefoot in the sand, and we all were completely put off swimming, thinking the water was likely dirty as well. I write this review hoping that the local council and/or the beachfront businesses can organize ongoing cleanup and pollution prevention for the area, as that beach is a major tourist draw."
Petek999,"Barnsley, UK",Oct 2017,"This is a wide long stretch of beach. There are many beach bars along most of the stretch, all with bean bags, tables, most having live music nightly, and serving cocktails beers etc.There are a lot of street traders prowling the beach, many of whom don’t like to take “no” for an answer. They can be quite intrusive if you are trying to have a conversation.If the clouds are right, the sunsets on this beach are not to be missed, cameras at the ready, you will get some great shots here."
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Oct 2017,"First opinions when we got down there was very muddy and a lot of rubbish lying around, but when we got onto the beach itself it wasn't bad at all, they are building the sea wall and it is very nice and very arty, would love to see it when it's completed  and everything is built up by hand.lovely walk across the beach but even when it's not to sunny, please put some sun cream as you will catch it, even if you don't think you will, be safe,  stopped in a couple of bars on the beach and again impressed, the only thing that put me off was there are dogs roaming around and what put me off was one had a dump right alongside where we walked from the bar to the sea, nobody around the bar areas (owners) picked it up and disposed of it, we soon disappeared back off the beach, there are no laws about pets or strays on the beach but I would have thought the bar tenders who was watching at the time could have done something and I also know they have to go somewhere, apart from that nice clean beach once you are on it.   "
djmcenergy,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"The beach is really long, so perfect for early morning walks. Lots to see along the way with loads of hotels spotted it length. Loads of beach bars as well.  The sand is nice and clean and water refreshing...... but remember to swim between the flags as they do have areas with rips.  "
Moracc,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,I loved Double Six beach...good and comfortable...the lounges right at the front are a must....you get to enjoy the waves and people surfing. I found it very clean. 
Rajiv M,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,"We went here late afternoon in April. great vibe, people playing football, jogging, shacks were busy but not overcrowded. We read a rubbish near the beach and had low expectations but were pleasantly surprised, it was very clean. Beautiful sunset spot. Evening walk near the beach is a must!"
Greg C,"Narre Warren, Australia",Nov 2017,"Not much shade and a fair amount of rubbish, it's ok to walk along in the evening but in the heat of the day you will roast because of the lack of trees."
GizmoMC,"Frankston, Australia",Oct 2017,"Vast, wide beach that stretches for miles. The people watching is plentiful with an assortment of bars, restaurants & hotels along the beach front. Busy but clean & the sunsets are amazing! "
DebbyTravel1974,"Breda, The Netherlands",Nov 2017,"Nice beach, wide, many restaurants. Go for dinner at Sarong, Mamasan or Bikini. Water is not always fresh and clear, lots of plastic unfortunately."
foxie2006,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"Popular, good waves for beginner surfers. A small amount of litter but not overwhelming. Beds under umbrellas for which you need to negotiate a price. Bars on the beach side, good posi for a Bintang or milkshake. Be prepared for hawkers to which you will have to say a firm no thank you until they get the message."
clavis2016,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,"This oZZie (Australian)  Outback themed  Pub  is totally complete with original Aussie outback  relics and even a crocodile on the front entrance to geet you and get your holiday pics with him...

Christina H,17 contributions,Oct 2017,"If you expect to go have a sunset view, this place would be suitable for this. There were less people selling stuff, not like Kuta beach."
Fattums B,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2017,The waves were astonishing.  The men on the beach who offer day beds are genuine and accommodating. Not a lot of garbage but I suspect that may change as there isn't a dedicated person to clean it. Overall great location with beautiful sand and waves 
Bells1000,"Stockholm, Sweden",Aug 2017,"Seminyak is pretty hectic but the beach is wide and you will find a decent spot to relax on. The more north you go, the more quiet it is.  The water is pretty wavy and the sunsets are beautiful."
Leo Z,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2017,"Perhaps because of the pending Volcano eruptions, Seminyak Beach was deserted. There were some shops on the shore but nothing eye-catching, and the sand, unlike Kuta Beach, was dark and coarse."
Alan_Bligh,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,Nice beach but the level of rubbish was shocking bad during this visit. I remembered it to be much better before.
JenHappyDays,27 contributions,Nov 2017,"I'm in love with Bali.. great beach, beanbag bars , live music, amazing sunsets ( don't get caught with people offering foot massage, we paid €12 small money but you can get a full body massage in a spa for €9) "
coralgb,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2017,Changed my mind on the best place to stay in Bali...its THE BREEZES SEMINYAK went to walk through JAYAKATA when there in June its very old and rundown now
adrianaB5381ON,"Essex, UK",Nov 2017,"The beach is amazing. It’s everything you’d expect from Bali. The sandy beaches are wide, and it stretches for miles. There are bars and hotels and restaurants dotted along the beach and the sunsets are to die for. The evenings are brought to life by performers from the bars and it’s somewhere you’ll never forget."
Poonam K,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,We went when tides were mostly high so the red flag was up a lot. The sand is beautiful. Only some parts of the beach are badly littered. 
Abang Lexa,"Jembrana, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Just walking with my new fliper itu was so clean and beautiful sunset , but you must keep clean also at there because , Local people at there is really love they beach"
Macdariens,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,"Went for a walk on the beach and the stench of sewage is pretty rank, also not that fond of seeing usedCondoms coming in with the waves and on the beach. That said if you can find a good spot out of the whiff of sewage it’s a great sunset. "
Andrew H,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"We love going to Bali, but the beach is not the attraction.  We have a walk on the beach every morning, but you  need to watch out for garbage on the sand.  Nappies, syringes, glass.... Really sorry that this is not getting any better."
pnssnp,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2017,the beach is very clean here even though it is visited by scores of people and the waters with myriad shades of green and blue make it a very attractive place to spend time at
Ghina A,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"Great place for chills with friends, wnjoy the sunset in bar or restaurantDon't forget to choose the right restaurant"
Tushar,4 contributions,Oct 2017,Good beach for an evening walk. Clean water except after rain lot of rubbish washes up the beach.Lots of bars and restaurants on beach offering food and drink options while enjoying great sunset.
trishnbek,"Lismore, Australia",Oct 2017,Very dirty beach disappointing howMuch rubbish is left around people should be ashamed leaving their rubbish behind 
Tomislav M,"Zagreb, Croatia",Oct 2017,"Like title ...very big sand ,very nice,clean beach.Also good for surfers but when we are there was no big waves."
Roberto,"Carrara, Italy",Oct 2017,Worth a visit! Beautiful walks; surfing; very nice bars on the beach for a drink! Enjoy the sunset here! 
linzai71,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,We went there a couple of times in the evening to watched the sunset and it was near our hotel. I’m not sure if this beach is good for swimming but it is good enough for a stroll along the beach in the evening and to watch sunset. 
Kristyrae79,"Kingsley, Australia",Oct 2017,"The atmosphere along this beach at night is what Bali is all about! The bands, the drinks, the food and the bean bags all add up to a fun relaxing end to your day, Or a great start to your night. Either way, if you're in Seminyak you must go down to the beach and spend sometime enjoying what they have to offer down there. Keep up the good work! "
MateEeMa,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2017,"A disgustingly dirty beach full of trash! I would never in my right mind spend time at the beach yet alone swim there!! It was bad 7 years ago when we first visited Bali, now it's just purely disgusting!"
saim1961,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,Just a short walk where we stayed is seminyak beach. Forget about Swimming cause the wave is too high and red flag everywhere.Nice to go for a stroll and sunset view.
Wael A,Doha,Sep 2017,"seminyak beach , is one of the best beaches in bali, we went there for a day trip, and was amazed how clean is the beach, a lot of people are surfing, and many water sports."
Lani F,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2017,"Best place to relax with a cocktail and watch the sunset. The sand is a little coarse as it is volcanic, so don't wear white."
recidivist8,Makati,Oct 2017,This beach area of bali is suitable for surfing for the beginners. Waves are pretty ok for surfing. There are alot of bars on the shore and alot of surfing instructors. 
Y8719REmarcon,6 contributions,Oct 2017,e like Seminyak Beach because it is clean and inviting for walks and jogging and it connects a number of beautiful hotels/restaurants with easy daytime and night time.walks
nayda62,"Ulverstone, Australia",Jun 2017,"Had my sons wedding in Bali, so relaxing, looking forward to going again.Balinese folk so welcoming, shopping and restaurants a hive of activity."
rufusatmarton,"Middlesbrough, UK",Oct 2017,The beach at Seminyak is not its finest feature. At certain states of the tide there can be rubbish and rain in the hills can wash natural rubbish down the small streams that cross the beach. There is a fairly steep shelve in certain areas which means that you should watch small children but the proliferation of surf schools means that there are experience people on hand at all times. Red flags seem to mean nothing
Girl with Wander Dreams,"Kumarakom, India",Oct 2017,"The water and the beaches are really very clean. Although haven't seen a lot of surfers but still come ppl did learn there as the waves are small. The beach has all amenities like shacks, restaurant with live bands in the night, private beach clubs and shops around to buy anything u want from beer to medicines. "
YSchreut,32 contributions,Oct 2017,It's a very nice beach to watch the sunset. It's very popular under the locals as well.Swimming is dangerous and the beaches are not the cleanest but even with that you can have a nice (long) walk.Only big disadvantage I found is that a water out of the city ends up into the sea at different points and it's hard to continue your way without putting at least 1 feet into it.
Kim K,12 contributions,Oct 2017,"Beautiful beach and could be more beautiful, if people did their part and picked up after themselves. We need to keep our oceans and land clean.  This area is a little more quiet then Kuta and Legian. My new favourite spot. "
SkinnyPufferFish,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2017,"I used to love coming here to sit on the beach and enjoy sunbathing or watching the sunset. I came this month with my friends and was disgusted by the rubbish found on the beach from start to finish. It was filled with plastic bottles, tin cans, plastic bags, cigarette packets and other rubbish. This is not suitable for children, fish or the environment. It’s disgusting and I’m appalled this is the condition it’s been left in. "
Teresa P,44 contributions,Oct 2017,Great for Long walks. Long stretch of sand. Cleaner than expected. Fantastic sunsets. Go to the Breeze at the Samanta hotel for a drink at sunset. Amazing seating and views.
Bernadette C,24 contributions,May 2017,Great day for just sitting under a umbrella having a few drinks with friends Many restaurants across the road to enjoy lunch then enjoy the rest of the day relaxing with music drinks and good company intill the sunsetsBeach sellers make it more interesting with buying gifts that after a few beers you may never of bought but very cheap just makes the experience and you can have a little fun.Worth a visit to make the holiday experience. 
Compass623049,19 contributions,Oct 2017,"Beautiful sunsets, worth going down the beach for sunrise and sunsets, great location and lots of seating along the beach "
Terese L,14 contributions,Sep 2017,the sunsets along the beach here is stunning there are plenty of places to relax have a cocktail and watch as the sunsets not too bad for a dip in the ocean on a hot day either 
Rasika V,Mumbai,Oct 2017," Beach is clean, good for an evening stroll. Not many bars around, so it is peaceful. Waves are strong. Some services that offer surfing classes. "
Ritu G,43 contributions,Oct 2017,"seminyak market is good but beach is unclean.It is just like Mumbai choupathy.No water activities are there.If going to seminyak,then one can visit.otherwise there are very good beaches in bali."
GINCHONE,"London, UK",Oct 2017,If you want to witness stunning sunsets go to Semyniak beach! For day time is nothing special and I would not recommend for little children because the waves are huge most of the time . 
David H,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Oct 2017,Good beach in seminyak. Very Hot in seminyak beachMany people in the world in hereGood palace happy in this palace. I Like seminyak Beach with my Family
BrightSide101,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2017,"Fabulous bars and restaurants along this section but still plenty of room for families to play, and dogs to run around.  Not as many hawkers and bars as in Legian"
dillymix,"Ulsan, South Korea",Oct 2017,"A chilled beach with a cool atmosphere. Beanbags, shishas and drinks served all day. The hawkers can be a little pushy but certainly not a too much of a problem."
Slucyd,UK,Oct 2017,Seminyak Beach is lovely. It's fairly clean although it could do with some rubbish bins along the way as I picked up a couple of bits of trash but couldn't find anywhere to put them! The sand is lovely and the water was warm every time we got in. We didn't surf but it looked fantastic for that and easy and affordable to hire a board or get a lesson. There are lots of beach front hotels and restaurants and the views are just always gorgeous!
Michael F,"Mount Annan, Australia",Oct 2017,Beatific sunsets beautiful location. Friendly locals and great little bar areas. Great restaraunt are everywhere and world class.
monika s,"London, UK",Oct 2017,"The beach was a good place to surf, but it is the beach to watch that the tide is in for that. If you go to a shop you will pay 1ml per person for a lesson, but we got a lesson from the boys on the beach and it was a very good one for 500k for the two of us and we had a trainer each.Beers and other drinks are very cheap on the beach"
Pat A,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Aug 2017,"Found the rubbish was a bit yuk,that floats from the water ways.The kids loved the water.Walking along there at night time around sunset is beautiful"
the travel writer,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2017,I love Seminyak beach!!!You can walk for ages...or runGreat surf beachgreat cafes and restaurants along the beach fringeGreat patrolled beach
Austy1971,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,Shame but the beaches were pretty dirty when we visited.  We didnt mind because we had our own private pool at our villa
DeVries1976,"London, UK",Oct 2017,The Seminyak beach is clean and not as crowded as Kuta and therefor more attractive to us. Plus just a few minutes walk from the hotel
Nihit,"Surat, India",Jun 2017,This beach is more chilled out compare to Kuta beach . I went here in morning and had a good time here ... it was all quiet & sand & sun ... nice for a walk or sit on the sand during dawn / dusk.   also easy to reach
Leslie,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"Entire stretch of smooth sand with old and young enjoying themselves. Children playing in the sand, splashing with water. Youths were flying kites. People were walking or jogging on the beach. Some surfers were surfing the waves. The sunset was worth waiting for to get that perfect shot. "
Lynn T,"Tokyo, Japan",Oct 2017,The beach seems to have more garbage as time goes on...this trip the garbage seems very excessive.. wonder if from sea or otherwise.  very smelly and bad
Elke M,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2017,"Standard tourist beach in Bali. Dark coloured sand but clean beach, a lot of people and activities, including a range of water sports. Lots of locals selling products."
Jules A,2 contributions,Oct 2017,Ok I stayed here. Nice place just giving you a review of the actual beach....it's. it that nice. For example just north of Potatoem Head beach club it is littered with rubbish (My kids refused to swim at Seminyak).  Not sure if the currents push this up form the south beaches. Kuta and Legian are nicer beaches. Kuta is jam packed with locals trying to sell you something so it may be this reason that people are moving awAy from Kuta beach. Legian is pretty good .... clean and much less locals trying to sell you things. If you are thinking of having a rest on the beach best to take your sunnies off and close your eyes and that way the locals leave you all ne
Gareth F,"London, UK",Oct 2017,Really nice long and deep beach. Don't expect spectacular beauty - not really blue seas or really white sands. Great sun and places to stop for a drink.  Some litter on the beach and a slightly off putting stream running near the restaurants.
Rani75,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2017,Semiyak Beach..... Beaches are always relaxing. Swimmer's enjoy this beach bcoz of waves. I would advice children and non swimmers to be careful as this beach is uneven and the waves are harsh..
Gavo308,"Success, Australia",May 2017,"Most beautiful place to watch the sun go down. Nice and relaxing with bean bags everywhere...Great music ,live..only problem was after ordering a drink the waiters seemed to have disappeared..waiting over twenty minutes for a drink and another fifteen for our change..Be prepared to be hassled by hawkers..."
Guyinherts,"London, UK",Nov 2016,"An amazingly long beautiful sandy beach, loads of different bars hotel etc along side it and you can come off it right into the centre of town. "
Debasmita C,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2017,Seminyak beach is equipped with many excellent bars and clubs. The beach is really beautiful. It's beauty doubles during sunset. We enjoyed every bit of the sunset from Seminyak. Loved it.
BhaskarM,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2017,Beautiful clean beach in Seminyak. Enjoy sun bath in sunny day. Popular among tourist and easily accessible. 
Lisa K,4 contributions,Sep 2017,Needs to be swept/cleaned. Beautiful sunset. Lovely restaurants on the water. Can learn to surf. Locals very friendly people. 
Jack Dandy,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"Lots of places to chill along the beach ie coconut stands, seats and beanbags. great waves awesome for surfing and really clean beach! "
Ellyhuis,"Phoenix, AZ",Jun 2017,"It was only 10 min away from our hotel. I enjoyed going to the beach there, it was clean, private, not too busy, the water is rough. "
tinabrian_12,"Wirral, UK",Oct 2017,The beach is mainly for surfers. You couldn't swim in it as it would be totally  unsafe. The shower at the opening of the beach stank +++++ and didn't even work.Well at least we seen it but we didn't  return. 
Chloe200000,"North Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"Plenty fun things to do and see on beach incl drinks lounges parties but not a pretty or clean beach. Dirty water, brownish sand. Also full of dogs in all sizes!!"
523paulot,"Lisbon, Portugal",Jul 2017,Nice beach with rough but warm sea. I love this warm waves. Lots of bars and restaurants at the sea side. Beautiful sunset and all the bars get prepared for a vibrating night.
venusbirth,"San Francisco, CA",Oct 2017,This is NOT A SWIMMING BEACH  and I am staying around the corner so I am not happy.I love ocean swimming and will be going to the Sunday Beach Club to try to find a swimmable non-fllthy beach.LOTS of people wandering around selling stuff and the typical trying to hustle tours off of tourists .... it is excessive AND THE GARBAGE WOW just WOW this is a SURFING beach and the balinese kids were killing it this AM
cherylsass,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"With the bars facing the sea and bean bags on the beach, we were spoilt for choice. There are also umbrellas with sunbeds for rent. We preferred Seminyak Beach to Kuta Beach. It is obviously less crowded, and sellers do not harass you much, except for a few of them who approach you selling pareos, accessories and paintings. Besides that, it was a very peaceful day out under the sun. We spent the whole day on the beach having beer after beer til sundown. Nice waves, nice water, it was perfect! The beach was clean which is important. We reckon the staff from the beach clubs are instructed to keep the beach clean to keep customers coming back. Music and the sound of waves crashing on the beach was the perfect combination while getting a tan or over a game of cards. If you want a less crowded & cleaner beach, choose this beach over Kuta Beach anyday. "
kmmellalieu,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2017,Had a beautiful day at the Beach. Nice Beach good waves and close to a lot of things. Can hire seating if required friendly people 
Alexandre D,"Sao Paulo, SP",Oct 2017,"I loved this place even though it is not the most beautiful beach in Indonesia. The place is worth it for its vibe and people. The sunset is one of the Earth’s wonder. It is really worth to see it. There are children on the beach, but be careful because the sea is kinda dangerous. "
KatePe,Melbourne,Sep 2017,"A beautiful stretch of beach, offering an abundance of bars along the way, meaning you can stop anywhere to enjoy an ice cold Bintang whilst watching the amazing show that is a Bali sunset. Our favorite thing to do in Bali is wander down here, grab a bean bag and a drink and take in the spectacular show that never fails to disappoint. "
ozboz2016,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,Comfortable beautiful beach. No where near as hectic as Kita and legion. Very pleasant and a lovely little bar for drinks and snacks
Jenni W,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Aug 2017,"For anyone looking for a great beach to spend a few hours, or the whole day at when in Bali you can’t go past Seminyak Beach. Day or night, it’s colourful, fun & totally beautiful. Food & drinks are available from the beachfront cafes, Juice Park is my fav, or from the friendly locals who serve you right at your sun lounge (which you can hire for an hour or the whole day very cheap). Make it a ‘must do’ in the night to buy a lantern from the local sellers on the beach (they will help you light it) & make a wish as you watch it rise up into the night sky..... very special 💜🌛🏮"
AuroraSeabreeze D,"Drapetsona, Greece",Sep 2017,"The best beach at Bali!!!!!!feeling free of everything!!!!you ll find perfect sea to surf unstoppable!!!coctails,music,swimming,diving,is all you need at a huge beach!!!!!"
Wies,"Best, The Netherlands",Sep 2017,"Great beach, good waves and nice water.Great place to take some surfing lessons from the local people, to swim and to relax."
PhilJackie2015,"Huntingdon, UK",Sep 2017,This is an extensive beach with all the amenities for hire from surf boards to sun loungers.  Viewed for just an hour late one afternoon
Claudiu U,29 contributions,Oct 2017,This is mostly a tourist beach. There are a lot of families with childrens. At night every bar has a live music band
LondonEbay_Queen,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"I had been told the beaches in Seminyak were stunning so I tagged a few days here onto the end of my trip.  I was slightly disappointed (and shocked) at how dirty they were though. I walked along the beach for an hour or so collecting shells before finding a beach bar to sit and watch the sunset.  In that time I saw a lot of accompanied and unaccompanied dogs ..... and with dogs comes s**t.  I saw more of it on the beach than I've seen on any other beach anywhere.  Not impressed.  In addition to the doggie issue, there were used nappies and general litter scattered all over the place.  There's no excuse for this and I just kept walking until I found the clean stretch I decided to settle at for the sunset.  Needless to say I was very careful where I stepped on my walk back towards town...."
228Kevin,"Cairns, Australia",Sep 2017,Seminyak is an extension of Legian and Kuta but not as busy. Had nice waves the day I was there. The beauty is having a drink watching the sun set. Could do this every night.
Jessica M,36 contributions,Sep 2017,My husband is a keen surfer and loved surfing at the beach. I just went to sun bath and relax which was nice. Not many families swimming at beach as waves quite big (is a known surf beach). The locals work very hard to keep the beach clean and I could see them cleaning on a daily basis. Lots of loungers out but you have to pay to use.
Charles R,3 contributions,Aug 2017,"First time visit this Beaches, we felt really noise with beach boys who always interrupt our Holiday in the Beach "
sueau54,"Macleay Island, Australia",Sep 2017,"The beach is really great with waves for the board riders either just starting out learning, or for the more experienced . There's heaps and heaps of people trying to flog anything they can. What was disappointing was the hawkers are teaching their young and very young kids how to do it..very off putting..The toilets you have to pay for now, they collect the money But they do Not Clean them that was more than disappointing.."
hazejagergabriela,"Ettalong Beach, Australia",Sep 2017,Just had a beautiful holiday in Seminjak. The beach and surf was great . Lifeguards on duty most of the day. The beach was mostly clean
Patrick Sarj,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Sep 2017,"Great place to watch the sunset/sitting on the beach drinking Heineken with mates. Fantastic views great waves , nice beach .  People everywhere. Lots of Indonesian people selling there bits and pieces on the beach. Overall a nice spot to sink a few cold ones before heading into town for the nightlife. "
Tyan B,Southbank,Sep 2017,Not a nice beach and busy as well.Much rather stay in the hotel resort pool. Quite nice for an early morning walk before breakfast 
Loullabelle71,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2017,"Great to walk along in the early mornings, don't be afraid of the dogs .. as they don't go near you at all!  no swimming at this beach, as in SEP 17, too many rips didnt allow.  Hubby dipped in quickly but found it to be extremely salty. Nice to look at, nice to walk along and that's it."
OJ_1999,"Amersham, UK",Aug 2017,"We did not have a bad time... but not the best beach in Bali, and quite dirty in places. Evening light was pleasant and we left when the beach was gearing up for the evening party..."
lovetotravel386,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2017,"Beach is dirty! Don't go to Seminyak looking for nice beaches. They have litter on them, stray dogs, etc. Don't get the hype. "
JJOH,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2017,Back when I was at primary school I remember seeing a to programme ('Watch') that featured Bali and it looked like paradise. Long time ago that but I'm now here at Seminyak Beach. Perhaps not the place it was back then and although nice enough I have visited many many more attractive beaches.Sand is lovely and fine but volcanic so quite dark in colour. It's a huge expanse of sand with little natural shade but there are rows an rows of sun beds with umbrellas like in Italy which I don't like. Hence for me it's paradise lost
Marjen183,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"We strolled along the beach in the late afternoon, with the tide well out. There were a lot of people on the beach, but not many in the water. The sand was a grayish colour and we had to step in smelly drain water on two occasions, which is obviously more apparent at low tide."
Suzophrenic,28 contributions,Sep 2017,Expensive pop up pubs and restaurants line it now . Ordinary beach . Wouldn't go back no tropical paradise here . 
Siphiwe,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Sep 2017,"Lovely beach with warm water and not to many traders. My only issue is the lack of dustbins and a place where you can wash after swimming, at the very least there must be a small tap where you can rinse off your feet. "
Kezzasboy,"Mildura, Australia",Sep 2017,We went down here walked along beach the sand isn't the pure white more a chocolate with shells. It is flagged for swimming and it was rough the red flags indicate a rip be careful. There isn't a lot on this beach which is good the water wasn't cold. It's ok
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,"Seminyak beach has to be on any Bali checklist. The Sunsets are super colourful with the umbrellas of La Plancha adding up to the scene! Good music, cocktails and vibes overall at the beach. "
"emma,sean d",9 contributions,Sep 2017,Loved the beach here spent whole day lounging around Plenty of great food on offer . Also didn't get hassled as much as in kuta
MissPP89,"Birmingham, UK",Sep 2017,Really big waves- would be good for surfing. Sand is fairly fine. No where to keep our stuff so had to take it in turns going in the sea
FledgeColac,"Glen Iris, Australia",Sep 2017,Certainly a great spot to watch the sunset but is spoilt somewhat by the amount of rubbish near the waterline and in some places along the top of the beach.
Rod B,82 contributions,Sep 2017,"Do not go to Bali beach expecting Golden Sands. Seminyak Beach is no exception, the beach is clean and the water warn, surf is ok but that's where it ends. Vendors  set up beach beds and hawk them for 100,000ir for 2 . Then once you are settled the hawker approach aggressively selling anything from beer to kites, surfing lessons to towel hire. Our choice was to use the resort pool where we were staying . Far more comfortable and hassle free. If you are not staying at a resort with a pool ,use the beach but be prepared for the price you must pay for being a TARGET TOURIST"
aleksbt,"Bitola, Republic of North Macedonia",Sep 2017,Best place to enjoy the gorgeous sunset while relaxing on sand loungers. Bit overcrowded with many sellers pushing to sell staff
KandAPandora,"Bristol, UK",Aug 2017,"This was a good beach for us because we wanted to do some surfing as beginners and we're looking for consistent waist deep foamy waves and sand all the way out. This was a better bet for us than the beach at Canggu where the surf was too messy for beginners in August. There may be somewhere better for beginner surfers... Surf board hire 200,000 idr for 2 hours for 2 boards and rash vestsIt stays shallow here for some way out but the waves can get quite big. Not so good for swimming.The beach isn't the cleanest but only in the respect that there is the same run off into the sea as you unfortunately find on other Bali beaches. Unfortunately, like many beaches in Bali you will also find lots of polystyrene balls chocking the sand from the burst beach bean bags put out for tourists to use."
nadiasarif,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"We were greeted by the locals offering the beach beds. We chose one with 100,000 Rupiah for 2 beds. The beach was clean. Everyone was friendly. It is definitely not as crowded as Kuta. The beach is a good place for those who prefer lesser noise and disturbance."
David F,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2017,"If you're expecting beautiful white beaches and swaying palm trees forget it. Instead you get dirty sand (and the sea doesn't look too clean either). No change rooms or toilets, and just about the entire length signposted ""for surfers only"". If you want to go in and cool off no choice but to ignore the signs. Loads of tacky souvenir shops, eateries and bars plus outrageous prices to hire the deckchairs. On the other hand lots of ""Bali watches"" for sale, some of which might even still be working once you get back on the plane!"
maggietynan,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,It is over 35 years since I last visited Bali and I could not get over the transformation.  The sellers on the beach were more controlled - they did not hassle - just there in the background and would descend only if encouraged.  It actually meant you could enjoy  the beach.  A big contrast from when I was last there
Christophe C,"Senlis, France",Sep 2017,Amazing long beach with many nice bar. Really nice to enjoy the sunset there and have some drink after. Looking forward to going there again. 
Suzanne K,17 contributions,Sep 2017,Seminyak beach is very busy and the beach itself is a little hard to swim in.busy with the locals trying to sells you goods.you can buy a snack or a sorang on the beach.
raina646,"Boca Raton, FL",Sep 2017,Beautiful beach 🌊 great waves. There's a lot of broken glass on the beach so be extra careful when walking around. Wasn't overly busy so that was a treat. 
vipula m,"Northampton, UK",Sep 2017,"Very nice beach bit crowded and brown sand but quite peaceful Very high waves Not many places to eat at the beach I liked it, did not get bothered much there by any one to buy stuff"
Michael,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2017,"Lovely beach, but just like any other sandy beach! It goes on for miles though! Wonderful walk along the beach where you pass many bars to stop off and have a drink and sun loungers to chill on and catch a tan!"
jastuewe,"Milwaukee, WI",Sep 2017,"We stayed in Seminyak for a week and absolutely loved the beach!  We walked the beach every morning before visiting another area.  We also spent a couple of days lounging on the beach with coconut water or a mixed drink.  Beautiful beach, beautiful view.  It was a little dirty and didn't have any garbage cans."
Bill And-Kerrie H,"Victoria, Australia",Sep 2017,The beech is well maintained with lots of local hawkers adding to the ambience.  Hire a beach couch and watch the waves roll in with a Bintang or grab some surfing lessons.  The beach hawkers will sell you (try to sell you) lots of stuff you don't need but that's part of the scene here.   Sunset anywhere along the beach is great.   Only a short stroll to the Seminak Village Square.  
AuntieSober,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,"Nice and relaxing beach. Next to La Lucciola, Potato Head and other local and international cafes. Night life is lively with many people around."
lionelt680,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2017,Beautiful sunset. An awesome experience with your partner. Clean beach and friendly locals. Many Restaurant bars along the beach.. Vibrant nightlife :)
anjanak64,"Nagpur, India",Sep 2017,"The beach and place is close to the airport.Take an uber to the main Street and walk to the place.Its surrounded by good restaurants like ke de ta and potato head to chill in.Though highly priced if you are going to spend hours at the place ,then it's worth it.The beach is clean  with lovely water.The day we visited the water seemed a bit rough but we did go in for a swim.Be carefull the sand shifts with the water.You would loungers at the beach which can be hired for two hours for 200000 IDR.the restaurants have there own showers and towels If you need them,otherwise there are public showers too."
Lance C,"Rhoose, UK",Sep 2017,Good for a surfing and chilling. There are some really nice bars on the beach near by with some good seating areas. It's a nice day out.

localondongirl,"Guildford, UK",Sep 2017,"Great for surfing, unsuitable for swimming. Beautiful for sunsets and walks. Vibrant with lots of bars and restaurants. "
MaxMaya,Singapore,Sep 2017,"Great morning runs or walks on this beach is awesome. Sand is compact and not damaging to the joints. Quiet and serene in the early mornings. Come late morning, it becomes a human jungle!"
Everyday_Spartan,22 contributions,Sep 2017,"Great beach to watch the sunset from and chill out in the day, good for surfing in certain sections, but not great for swimming. "
Shai Vicky,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"Dark, fine volcanic sand beach. Wide expanse at low tide. Great sunset views.Red flag signals a no-swimming zone, due to the strong current.Red and yellow flags indicate that you can swim there.Decent crowd on the beach at night enjoying live music. Everything ends before midnight. No all-night party-goers."
Mark H,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,We were in Seminyak in September the sun set around 6:15. The beach has many bars with bean bags to sit on & chilled music. Great place to umwind.
Glenn Nicholls,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,"A nice place to sit at relax but I would not go swimming as between La Lucciola Restaurant and the car park there is a stormwater sewage canal that enters the beach and the sea, how ever if you go down to the beach for the sunset grab a drink and a fresh corn sit on the beach and relax"
Cerin C,"Clovelly, Australia",Aug 2017,so beautfiul and amazing sunsets. friendly people and good enviroment  would gladly go back. very calm 
Papamoabill,"Papamoa, New Zealand",Sep 2017,Not the most inviting beach I've been touch. Had to cross sewage contaminated lagoon to get to the ocean and would think twice about swimming in it. Looks nice though. 
Wanderer,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,My friends and I went to take a swim and realized that the sewerage water leads directly into the sea. Please do not swim. Disappointed that the beach was filthy!
Paul L,"Nijkerk, The Netherlands",Sep 2017,We went to the beach to swim but saw a surfing rental. we paid 200k for 1 hour lesson and 1 hour free practice. great waves and good surfing schools! a must do!
Greg C,"Cape Paterson, Australia",Sep 2017,Seems that this beach is great for surfing and relaxing upon - not so sure about swimming as the gradient is low.
Trina Moore,"Ashburton, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Nice beach, even better in the evening to watch the sunset, so many restaurants offering colorful seating along the beach. Such a nice spot"
Tom S,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2017,"Really nice beach located a 5-10 min walk from seminyak sq. lots of things to do, hire a surf board for an hour (50k-100k) hire a body board (~50k) do a surf lesson for an hour (200k and we got to keep the board for an extra hour). We also had sundowners outside the anantara hotel which were great. Very reasonably priced drinks for what is an excellent location to watch the sun slip into the sea on some rather comfy beanbags!"
Louise P,"Reedy Creek, Australia",Sep 2017,But not to swim in ... rips and currents make it too unsafe to do so.A very long stretch of beach which allows you to look at the other hotels on the beach. 
R. Layne Holley,"Memphis, TN",Sep 2017,"For some reason, I delayed travel to Indonesia despite visiting so many other countries in SEAsia, some more than once. Now that I have finally experienced Bali's Seminyak Beach area, it has suddenly reached the top of the pyramid. It is my new First Choice destination. The beach is very wide. The sand is fine and glistens in the sun. The ocean winds seem constant and is refreshing from the heat. Shelling is possible in a few areas but don't expect much on that front. The surf is robust but far more so to the north. Hotels, resorts, beach cafes and on-the-beach bars are prolific. There's a few very, very polite beach peddlers who are not at all pushy. It's a superb area any beach lover. "
Amr E,"Cairo, Egypt",Sep 2017,You got multiple options1. Sit on a bean bag and have a drink2. Sit on casual dining tablesSo many restaurants to select from with nice price and quality food. $10-$15 for a meal for two
Jodeacon,"Reading, UK",Sep 2017,"Huge beach with a great atmosphere. It's very clean and lovely comfortable sun beds (200k IDR for the day)The waves are quite strong so not really for swimming, but great to enjoy messing around in the surf. Without a doubt the best time of day to visit is late afternoon - there is a great laid back atmosphere and the beach offers amazing views of the sunset. There are lots of bars along the beach - all with beanbags where you can relax and enjoy the view with a couple of Bintangs! Also great to stay into the evening as there is lots of live music to enjoy "
bikomigo,Sydney,Sep 2017,Preferred to stick to swimming in our gorgeous resort hotel and watch the sunsets from there.  Coming from Sydney didn't think Seminyak beach was anything special.  Enjoyed our swim at nusa doa beach instead.
ariesnz,NZ,Sep 2017,Enjoyed beach walks at the end of the day.  I found the beach looked very different compared to mornings.
Karen O,"Sebastopol, CA",Sep 2017,Nice beach. Not the best surf. Restaurant/bar area right on the boardwalk. Didn't really impress compared to other beaches but there were less people coming up to your chairs selling stuff.  Kuta and canggu were better surf but non stop selling of goods. 
JanPat2013,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Aug 2017,Enjoyed lots of walksOn the beach Lots of people about some on chairs and loungers enjoying the sunsets.Good views along the long beach-front.  A 'must visit' at and before sunset!!
Peivven,17 contributions,Aug 2017,"We went to the beach outside potato head beach club. My 3-year old son loved it and we stayed for an hour and a half! It was extremely hot, but we rented the beds under the umbrella for 100,000 IDR an hour and enjoyed a coconut drink. The sound of the waves were lovely and my son enjoyed playing sand under the umbrella. "
Lovablezed,17 contributions,Jul 2017,"Really enjoyed watching the sunset here, great atmosphere and vibe. We walked along the beach and there are a number of beach clubs / restaurants that you can sit at and watch the sunset from whilst drinking a beverage of your choice. "
alfismont,"Bath, UK",Sep 2017,Enjoyed playing in the surf here and bartering for sunbeds .. keep walking and you will get a good price 
Annieinsaudi,"Dhahran, Saudi Arabia",Sep 2017,We loved our long sunset walks along the beach. It's quieter than other bali beaches but still has life to it. 
jjbaby1,"Buderim, Australia",Sep 2017,"Worth a visit, definitely a tourist destination. Beach filled with locals selling their goods and sun beds"
Johann M,2 contributions,Sep 2017,"Very nice and quiet. If you like a lot of people and loud vibrant scene, then this place is NOT for you. It's very lad back. Even the waves ate pretty calm. Great for someone learning how to surf. Pro surfers will NOT like this beach. "
SanghasUK,"Alton, UK",Aug 2017,"I walked the whole bay from Kuta (southernmost point) to Petitenget beach (northernmost point). Best place I found for family was just north of Jl Camplung Tanduk (the road with The Royal Beach Hotel). When you get to the beach turn right and about 200 M is a place to avoid the masses, a bit quieter, Sunbeds are around 100,000 Rupiah on the beach (£6)"
swnj_1701,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2017,Great fun to be had with the sellers on the beach. Sun shinning everyone happy. Can't wait to return one day. Fab atmosphere on this beach. Not to busy during the day but comes alive at sunset.We walked along the beach to Kuta we didnt like it there way way to busy stick to semyniak
Ooi C,3 contributions,Aug 2017,Beautiful and Nice beach.The sun is hot.The chair from the beach Rupiah 150000 is costly.No massage on the beach?

kevin d,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2017, Nice beach but very busy Not the greatest for swimmingFantastic night life along the beach Set up for dining drinking and music if thats your passion
Hadi R,79 contributions,Sep 2017,You definitely want to watch sunset when u are in bali. The view and the breathe are fantastic. U can enjoy the wind and the view. I was there the other day to witness the sunset and i am blessed that i was here. Its a place that you want to be at least once in ur lifetime. 
aircsi,"Phoenix, AZ",Sep 2017,"Had heard many different stories about this beach and in our experience for four days it was excellent. It was clean, weather was fantastic, and the beach boys were very helpful in securing us beach lounges. Very nice and fun beach."
Jason C,"Taguig City, Philippines",Aug 2017,"I'm from a country (the Philippines) with incredible beaches, if I may say so myself, so my expectations about Seminyak Beach was a bit high. It was okay, but nothing more and nothing less.The vendors peddling beach chairs and umbrellas can also get in your nerves if you're unprepared for them. I recommend haggling low, then working up to a compromise."
Prem T,delhi,Aug 2017,Good clean beach. The waves are very strong in evening and not feasible for swimming. There are not many independent restaurants along the beach as most are the ones owned by hotels on the beach. 
Dabsi0905,Bregenz,Aug 2017,At Seminyak Beach you can enjoy beautiful sunsets in one of the beach bars but you can also rent a sunshade and a sun lounger and stay there for hours. Beautiful beach!!! 
UriaChen,"New Taipei, Taiwan",Sep 2017,"There are many restaurants and offer sofas at the beach , drink cocktail and watch the sunset with your beloved one."
globetrotter1392,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"Good sandy beach, relatively quiet with mainly dogs wondering along the sand. Very little to do here but perfect for lying in the sun. "
nancyabdelsaid,"Harrow, UK",Sep 2017,"Seminyak beach is lovely, though it doesn't have golden sands and crystal blue seas, it was still a lovely and clean beach where we spent hours relaxing.In the evenings you're almost certainly guaranteed a stunning sunset which is worth the wait for.Very calm,peaceful and tranquil.Really enjoyed staying in a hotel just beside this beach "
joembre,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"This is a busy, thriving beach. The temperature of the sea is lovely. Rated only 3 stars as it has way too much rubbish around the roads and so many stray dogs. What is really nice is everyone is chilled and happy."
555steve,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2017,"Great scenic beach in Bali. Black sand and plenty of the tourist stuff (beer, soft drinks, fake tattoos etc). Typical beach in Bali but a bit quieter than Kira."
TravelExplorer193,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"People always talk about Bali sunsets. The waves were very heavy , so not too much swimming. However the wide beach was the perfect backdrop to a stunning sunset"
FabianP1998,"Upper Austria, Austria",Aug 2017,Really loved the sunsets there. Lot of people though at certain parts. Definitely put it on your todo list!
Argya N,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"It is definitely not the most beautiful beach, however the sunset was really nice and there were plenty of beach lounge to relax. Not as crowded as Kuta and had a wide sandy shore to walk by during the sunset. Probably better to went there by foot since it was hard to find parking lot and it costs 15k rupiah for parking car (domestic tourist here)."
lbbarb,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,Very disappointing sand is dark water is alot colder than i expected and water very average. Wouldn't bother coming here to swim..
Julia S,4 contributions,Aug 2017,"This is a strange beach - it goes on for miles and miles but it's not like the beaches of Thailand or other comparable locations. The shoreline is very very shallow, so you can walk out about 100m and the water is still only up to your waist but the currents are very strong so you can only really swim between the designated flags and even then the waves will smash into you. The sand is dark and very fine (so pretty sticky). However, the sunset is beautiful and it's a great place to rock up, sit on bean bags with a Bintang at the end of the day. Also great if you want to go to any of the beach clubs and get the best of music, pools and the beach,"
Alula S,"Depok, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"I like the beach because not as crowded as kuta, the sunset also gorgeous. only one thing that make uncomfortable are the lady that selling accessories/ offering massage really insist and aggressive."
KANKARIA,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2017,"An enjoyable beach but not the kind of white sandy pristine beach. If the resort/hotel where one stays is contagious, then it can be more enjoyable. "
Kristine M,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2017,"We have been to the beach a number of times now. Just walking & enjoying people watching. It's great for anyone who enjoys the outdoors. The beach is clean & apart from the hawkers selling their wares, it's very relaxing. You can sit on the sand for free or hire a lounge with/without an umbrella, there are also been bag chairs - free if you get a drink or plastic chairs same same. Evening time sees it all come alive with music & sunset (not to be missed). "
Aoife M,"San Francisco, CA",Aug 2017,"Great beach with lots to do on the beach, beginning surfing lessons can be given by locals for 250rp for like 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Water not at clear as you would hope but lovely all the same "
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,The sand is black and the sea is so wavy! Not suitable if you want to have a swim but definitely good for surfers! 
Rachael S,"Beccles, UK",Aug 2017,A good fun beach to visit if you like a bit of atmosphere! The sand is fine and there are plenty of sun loungers. Even though it is very very busy there is plenty of space as it is so big. People come here to surf so the ocean is full of surfers. Therefore you can not swim in the ocean.
ShellB49,"Houston, TX",Aug 2017,"The combo of the town's raw sewage flowing into the beach water, plus dangerous currents and waves which prohibit swimming make this a terrible beach for tourists."
JCSport1,"Wollongong, Australia",Aug 2017,"After we hired our scooters we headed down to the Beach for a Bintang or three at one of the bars and then went back again for Tapas that evening. This place is sensational, we were also treated to some of the best live DJ music mixes we have ever heard that evening, do not miss Seminyak Beach when you come to Bali!"
Jessica A,"Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia",Aug 2017,"great time, enjoy a beer and just relax for the sunset time, also you can rent a surf board and try it "
Trevor J,33 contributions,Aug 2017,This beach is great compared to the beaches closer to the Kuta area. There is minimal rubbish and the water is clear.
Iain P,"Bishops Stortford, UK",Jul 2017,"After visiting this area and the positive reports on this beech we were dreadfully disappointed. The locals that offer there sacrifices to there gods all wash up on the beach, OK we have to be respectful but really!What made it worse for us is the garbage that washes on to the beach from local water sources and the packs of dogs that roam around the beach and the crap that they do not bury or their owners do not pick up.So beware!OK the sunsets with corn and Bintang are beautiful works of art to enjoy each night but please be careful"
melrowan,10 contributions,Aug 2017,"It was definitely one beautiful beach, but we were kinda disappointed as it was nearly overcrowded! Not that we didn't have a good time at the beach... But I prefer a bit more peace! "
vivifang99,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,Love the beach. The sun. The sand. The view. The smile. The food. Love the people that come from different country :) having the same interest..... sun bathing .... yeaaahhhhh
Becksmartin,"Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Really vibrant, tonnes happening - awesome spot. Hire loungers on the beach by day and sip on a Bintang on a beanbag at night and watch the sunset. Or enjoy one of the many hotel bars or beach clubs along this beach. "
SEIJR,"Brighton and Hove, UK",Aug 2017,Disappointed with Seminyak beach. Really surprised how expensive the lounge hire was considering how cheap everything is in Bali. The average cost was 400IRP per day for 2 loungers and a umbrella. This is about £23.Also the beach area near Ku Da Te we found it to be really smelly and the water very dirty. There are a couple of water outlets which come out into the sea here causing these problems. But if you go towards Kuta it seems to be fine. 
Ascolovesla,"Vancouver, Canada",Aug 2017,Unfortunately garbage had washed up on shore. Otherwise beautiful and expansive. The water isn't crystal clear like Hawaii.
EllenOnVacation,California,Aug 2017,"Not a nice beach to hang out with family.  There was some type of dirty water dumping right into the beach and it smelled like sewer.  The foam was actually brown!!There were dogs defecating everywhere.  The designated area where there was suppose to be water for rinsing off was non-operational, with no water."
noorar744,"Helsinki, Finland",Aug 2017,"Nothing special, like the whole Seminyak area. There was a weird smell at the beach and towards north it was a bit trashy. Big waves so no swimming. Sunbeds were expensive (100)"
totallyNotRoman,"Kuta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Don't know how it used to be before but it's too overcrowded with tourists now. And annoying, fat, richer ones too; since it's kind of expensive and filled with resorts. The beach itself is a simple flat one with sandy sea access without any fauna and just the resorts. It's on the west side so the sunsets are nice though."
gvodbos,"Mechelen, Belgium",Jul 2017,"Nice sandy beach with lots of wind surfers.  Too many waves for swimming though.  And yes, sunset is great, especially with a beer at one of the many beer stalls."
v1ck12014,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,You can walk forever because there is. A bar every 50ft and walking is thirsty work.  Loads of beach activities. 
Allie I,"London, UK",Aug 2017,Beautiful! I'd recommend everyone to have a stroll down black sand beach. Lots of lovely places to eat and drink on the each for great values Very strong current if you want to go in the water so be careful  but great waves for surfers. Lifeguard loved his whistle! 
Janel F,"Cape Town, South Africa",Aug 2017,"Great beach , good vibes! Loads of restaurants on the beach to choose from! You can rent sun lounges from IDR100 000, bintangs in the beach tend to be cheaper than from the restaurants. "
Cornelia T,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"when in Bali, you do not want to miss out on the best sunsets ever. Just go anywhere on Seminyak beach, have a drink and enjoy the beautiful spectacle ."
Rhea R,14 contributions,Aug 2017,"Water is more for surfing but, nice place to just hang around.Chill!Nice shoreline.Decent amount of crowd as well.Quite a private access/entry point.Perfect if you stay at Grandma Hotel Seminyak."
Thomas K,Paris,Aug 2017,"Lovely beach, some hassle but not too much. Sunsets and evenings on beach bars are a must! If you want peace- head north."
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",May 2017,Loved the beach.  Had fun playing in the sand and the waves - Really nice beach and truly gorgeous views of the ocean. 
Helsim2017,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,Clean beach lots of kites not too crowded with lifesavers and lots of places for drinks and snacks  along the shore 
Rebekah F,5 contributions,Jul 2017,We really enjoyed the atmosphere of Seminyak Beach. Our teenage kids thoroughly enjoyed boogie boarding and eating on the beach. Hire a sun bed and enjoy.
guildfordians,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2017,Nice to look atBeautiful peaceful beach walk on the sand. Not swimmable unless your a surf life saver or extremely experienced swimmer. Please listen to life guards and swim between flags as the ocean can be unforgiving The sand is a dull grey so not the white beach you may be looking for . But for beach walking it's beautiful  
inVINCEable77,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,It is a must stop if you are in the area. If you can make it around dusk would be ideal as the sunsets are amazing. If you want an excellent beachside relaxation stop and are not in a resort that has Beach access then find your way down as it is something you will not regret. 
ThaiTraveller2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,We stayed at The Royal Beach witch has direct access to the beach and what a great section of beach it is.With lots of bars and places to eat you cannot go wrong and enjoy the sunset.
CiaraNiC87,Ireland,Jul 2017,"The beach is vast and glorious. You see many activities taking place here and can purchase many things from your towel such as scarves, jewellery, food and drink. Surf lessons are offered and both surf boards and body boards are available for rent at a decent price. You can also hire beds near the hotels. When we went 'swimming' however we struggled with the size and ferocity of the waves. It was great fun trying to body surf the waves and I'd totally go again. A close eye would be needed to be kept on children in and around the water. "
DanRoppelt,"Hamilton, Canada",Jul 2017,Loved the waves and the water. Suitable for swimming but dont venture out too far! THe undertow can be strong at times
Mohamed I,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2017,Seminyak beach has a very clean sand and easy access. The sunset is an amazing moment at this wonderful beach.
Rita Lee,"New Lambton, Australia",Aug 2017,Like Bali in off peak times otherwise too many idiots and crappy shops would rather stay in cannggu love it there
Nikhu B,7 contributions,Jul 2017,"Music, drinks and chairs to relax in the evening, Seminyak is the best.! We stayed in Hotel horison so it was convenient to walk down to seminyak beach. Also, double six beach is just beside to this seminyak beach. There are many restaurants oppo to these two beaches. Pretty good time if you looking to just relax and get a peace of mind with friends and family. "
Mary N,"Hong Kong Island, China",Aug 2017,"We had stayed in Nusa Dua and Jimbaran Bay before and loved this section of Bali at Seminyak near The Legian as the beach is long, sand is soft though not white. You could walk all the way along all the hotels, resorts, restauranrs, bars and surf! Surfing class is 200,000 rupiah, rental is 100,000 and boogey board is 50,000. Wave is great and our teenage kids ride on the wave on their first class! Would definitely stay here again next time!"
Karen M,"Kirup, Australia",Aug 2017,Very busy but quite spectacular! Took our young children and they all enjoyed running along the beach and playing in the sand. 
MersMajid,"Paris, France",Aug 2017,"Despite the crowd - we still love this place. Even though it is starting to feel like an European resort - we hardly see many Asian tourists , which is a pity. Sunsets are really fantastic"
준혁 김,15 contributions,Aug 2017,"Lots of quality restaurants around. Nice weather, waves and kind ppl. Little bit expensive to rent sun beds."
Silindile Dube,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach was always packed with tourists. The water is not too cold, you can hire chairs to relax at the beach. It is clean and there are guides."
lmb1989,"Phoenix, AZ",Aug 2017,Clean pristine miles of hotels and privacy along the coast. Great surf for intermediate or better surfers 
Jensbertelsen,"Sauveterre-de-Bearn, France",Aug 2017,"Meh! 😐 I am no Globetrotter but I have travelled the world fairly well and I do love I do love a beautiful sunset, yet this one will not rock my world for sure.Been there, done that, didn't buy the t-shirt like the 3000 other people there.Verdict = Tourist trap.I am sure there are better places to watch a sunset in Bali and I will look for it next time here."
aspearce,"Goolwa, Australia",Aug 2017,Loved chilling out eating dinner and having drinks in the bean bags on the beach watching the sunset.  Get there early though 
Jimmyjack2440,Crescent Head,Jul 2017,Beach 66 at seminyak is the best place in Bali to relax & chill out. With restaurants on the beach & cocktails all day to live music at night it's the place to be to chill out & unwind. 
Jorge M,"Lisbon, Portugal",Aug 2017,"The Indian ocean waters are beautifully warm in Bali and the waves not big enough to torment anyone. The beach itself is not particularly beautiful and cleanliness not its key feature but it is great for long romantic walks and we felt very safe even at night. Walk south east for the eventful surfing areas, north west for the quiet spots. "
Oscar A,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2017,"I am just reviewing Seminyak Beach ( Marriott hotel beach). Its been a long time since we used to holiday in Bali. but over 10 years ago, Bali beaches were polluted (full of rubbish), fortunately, this have changed now, beaches are clean. This in itself, will play a big deal for our next holiday destination."
TheJape,"Graz, Austria",Aug 2017,"Beach is fine in terms of views, but its not for swimming, if you are surfer you will probably enjoy it. Anyway if you are looking for place to chill and swim do not go here."
Hannah W,8 contributions,Aug 2017,Did not like the beach at all. Was very over crowded and just full of sun beds. There are however beach clubs you can go to or places similar to this. I think it lacked culture. 
CJO193,"Te Puke, New Zealand",Aug 2017,A nice walk along the beach.. a long stretch of beach with good surf.. a few locals selling products along the way 
Skinnychef2014,"Hoboken, NJ",Aug 2017,"Loved my surf lesson - so much better and cheaper compared to the US! The beach is clean and very beautiful, cool but not freezing water, and the cafes along the beach are great."
chamboNsw,NSW,Jul 2017,"This beach is used for many different things, religious ceremonies, family group outings (on Sunday as it's their day off), and of course for tourists parading their new swimwear!   Every few metres is a bar, some have food others have loungers, and a lot of them have public toilets.  Some charge a few coins others are free.    On our last day we noticed groups of workers on the beach collecting litter and debris from the previous days' high tides.  Nice to see."
scott s,17 contributions,Aug 2017,Once upon a time this beach was fabulous and a place to watch the sunset orange over the ocean. And I'm sure it will be again once the Balinese gov discover the benefits of sewage treatment...
ShahFam,"New York City, NY",May 2017,We went to Seminyak Beach twice. Both times at Sunset. Beautiful view! The beach is clean and family friendly. The fresh corn available at the entrance...not to be missed.
olivia h,"Petersfield, UK",Aug 2017,The beach in Seminyak is okay. It's not the best but it's not bad. The waves are very strong so you have to be careful when staying there. The sunbeds sometimes get waves underneath them as the tide comes in very fast and far. However the location is very good as there are lots of restaurants and market stalls near. 
Mai M,8 contributions,Aug 2017,Corse sand and rough waves don't be fooled by hustlers selling seats a towel is still a great ideal. People selling aray of small gifts for your friends back home. Restaurants near by and drinking allowed whoah
717vipink,5 contributions,Apr 2017,"Beaches of bali are best in the world. There is zimbaran beach where you can go for the evening fun, there will be live shows and open restaurants where you can enjoy."
Mav,"Hong Kong Island, China",Aug 2017,"The beach have everything! Nice place chilling with frds, with beers, sunset and food!! Some restaurant got live band :)"
shoque31,"London, UK",Aug 2017,"Lovely, kids loved the day. Tide is really strong, so hold onto the children. Downside, beach chairs can be very expensive, so best to bargain and or take lots of towels. Could not find anywhere to wash feet once off the beach. Also, quite hard to get hold of a licensed taxi (bluebird). Recommend, but be prepared if with children"
bitsagra,agra,Jul 2017,The beaches are small and crowded but clean. good place to drink and eat alongside. Sometimes too many vendors spoil the fun but overall good experience
ArizKohli,Mumbai,Jul 2017,"If you like your swim in the sea a little bit on the rough side this is a great. Kid took surfing lessons, the waves and current were a bit rough; we were immediately warned and pulled back whenever we ventured a bit too deep. The beach is clean and so is the water, don't know why some visitors have expressed otherwise. I loved it."
Debbie V,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"We parked ourselves at Mumma Rondas chairs over a few days during our stay. She is one of the loveliest most helpful and grateful ladies I've come across. Chairs with umbrella cost 10NZ for 2. She has fresh fruit salad, 3.50, Bintang and other assorted drinks including fresh coconuts. You do get the Hawkers trying to sell to you moreso if you sit in the loungers than on the beach. As the sun is so hot I would recommend grabbing a sun lounger and fending the hawkers off. Waves were too big for body surfing for us but we still had fun. There's a public toilet across the road, very stinky but find me one that isn't in Asia!!"
Blueyonda29,"Stockport, UK",Jul 2017,"We visited this beach several times on our trip, both during the day and the evening. The water is clean and the sand is soft. The beach was busy but we always found a sun lounger to rent or a space in a bar. This beach is a must in the evening before 6pm to watch the sunset whilst sat on a colourful beanbag with cocktails in hand. A real experience with music and the hustle and bustle. There are many beach vendors selling various bits and bobs, we just learned to wave them off and not be bothered by it. The water is too choppy to swim but great for paddling or body boards etc. We read reviews before our trip to say the beach was dirty but we found this to not be the case. We ate there several times and found the food to be great, but a little pricey in comparison to off the beach. "
lynn n,"Cebu Island, Philippines",Aug 2017,"Not really a picturesque venue....But the massive waves are good, brilliant for surfing especially it being so close to Canggu. However if your here for the ambience lol yeah just get a bed & drink coconuts lol..... You'll need it. Also a bit crowded so but well, at least you get the beach"
Laura G,"Newport Pagnell, UK",Aug 2017,The beach was good to watch the surf as there was lots of massive waves ideal for surfing but there is no swimming along much of the beach and lots lifeguards.Many many bars along the beach that get very crowded at night.Beach is not ideal for young kids as sand dirty and the waves are far too big for the kids to be able to swim.
RAVSHARAN,"Patiala, India",Jul 2017,The beach is clean and nice . But the tide timings should be kept in mind . The tide timings differ everyday . Its available on the resorts on the beachside like potato house and W.
SydneySider1983,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2017,"There's not much going on here. Sand is dark, not the prettiest beach. Head to a beach club or a lovely pool instead!"
irishrugbynut,166 contributions,Aug 2017,Very enjoyable beach paradise with many beachside restaurants and bars good food and drinking options.Lots of shops nearbyGreat poolbars restarantsMassage spas etc
dbwteach1,"New York City, NY",Jul 2017,"Nice large Beach area, but not very clean. The sunrise/sunset views were the best. We had a short walk from our hotel to the beach. It wasn't immediately obvious how to access the beach, but we did find an entrance pass the police station. There was a lot of activity in this location, there's a place to rent scooters and enjoy street food. There was a lot of people in the area selling local fair. The grilled corn stand with the brown sweet butter, drew a crowd."
Marina S,69 contributions,Aug 2017,Huge endless beach with many activities going on... from surfing  to horse riding and live music... amazing sunsets good vibe fun and relaxing at the same time😊
paras j,"Mumbai, India",Jul 2017,The beach is clean and nice but the facilities not too good. Kuta beach or Nusa dua is better and more fun  
Karthik Shankar,87 contributions,Nov 2016,"Great views and waves, one of the best surfing spots in the world! Its always vibrant with lots of restaurants by the beach, plenty of activities going on, enjoy a game of football or jump on to a karaoke machine and sing away. For those who seek quiet just stroll down the beach away from all this and sit on the sand and enjoy the sunset!"
8684854655,43 contributions,Jul 2017,Our nyuh luxury villa seminyak offered free shuttle to this beach and definitely the cleanest and most happening beach in bali...went to a shack with bean bags...amazing sunset view
Hans N,"Haarlem, The Netherlands",Jul 2017,"This beach disappoints. Small coffee bar. Waves to surf, but I did not see anybody doing it. Not too many people around. Prefer Kuta beach."
jean,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2017,A good beach minus all the crowds and food stalls of kuta. Good for sunset views too. Potato head beach club is very popular here
Aqem A,"Melaka, Malaysia",Jul 2017,"Seminyak Beach, jalan Raya Seminyak, 24 hours. Seminyak Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach situated in north of Legian Beach. The white sand stretch 3 km from Tuban Area has made it as a fascination for tourist to visit this place. Seminyak Beach is favored by the great wave that is ideally for surfing adventures hence many surfers visit this beach to conquer the waves and enjoy the surf adventures. This beach is also featured by beautiful panorama to the Indian Ocean, the wide white sand, complete public facilities, the word class hotels, international restaurant and more."
Claire Annand,"Kent, UK",Jul 2017,"Seminyak beach is a nice large beach to walk along with lots of bars / restaurants to enjoy. It is not an overly clean beach - we come across a lot of dog poo! And the sand isn't golden white. We wouldn't attempt to swim either as the sea is very tidal and wavy. However, it has beautiful sunset views, is lovely to walk along and is very wide. It's definitely worth a visit but it isn't your relaxing beautiful Caribbean beach."
SDL5965,"Queensland, Australia",Jul 2017,"Walked along the beach every day we were there.  The waves crashing in are just amazing, no wonder there are so many surfers there. Sunset was breathtaking.  A lot of people selling things on the beach from jewellery, hats, sunglasses, kites, canvases etc.  if you sit on the bean bags on the beach or at many of the bars on the beach you can be pestered constantly.  At night the beach is lit up with colour from the umbrella lights and the neon hanging lights.  Bands play at the bars and it's certainly worth a visit or two."
mcgetty,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2017,"Seyminak Beach is beautiful when you first see it. The waves are crazy and it is a long and impressive. However, I was a bit disappointed as it was pretty dirty in places and sewage smell was also quite strong in certain sections. Also I was there in July and there were massive crowds. I would save my time for the beach in a better place on the island than here."
TKazz,"Aalborg, Denmark",Jul 2017,"Our daughters were up for trying surfing and according to locals here, it should be Seminyak, so we hired a driver and went to the west coast.Water was more waves than east coast (Sanur) where we stayed.We found a place with some goid lical instructors and the girls had fun surfing for a couple of hours.Price was 150K for approx. 2 hours, so ok.Also great clean sandy beach and at least this day no plastic and rubbish lykng around.So overall a great day at Seminyak beach."
Swati S,4 contributions,Jul 2017,Food is delicious. Place is Awsm. Nd the most beautiful is I enjoyed a lot there. When I go with my frnds.  ...We enjoy soo much. 
acsaroj,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2017,"Just like your regular beach, nothing to write home about...not so crowded though at about 5 in the evening...good for a nice stroll..."
Astronaught,"Mijas Pueblo, Spain",Jul 2017,"We visited Seminyak beach in 2007 and the place was a haven of tranquility with the locals swimming and fishing in the ocean. Fast forward to 2017 and the beach feels like the gold coast of Australia, so busy and not the place it was. That said, I guess it's progress and it's a lovely long beach, but there's nicer beaches in Bali."
auberswell,"Harlington, UK",Jul 2017,"Excellent locationClean, beautifully appointed, spacious room with superb views over the sea. The friendly and very helpful staff made us welcome at all times. The breakfast buffet was extensive and if you could order from a menu in addition to the buffet.Would happily stay again. "
Parisa,2 contributions,Jul 2017, we had sunset dinner at the beach with an amazing view definitely recommend. The food might be a bit expensive but it is well worth it . 
HelandRich,"Nottingham, UK",Jul 2017,"The beach itself is not the best out there, we found it to be quite clean but I think that is dependant on the tides. The best thing for us about this beach is that you can walk up and down long stretches, particularly as the sun sets. It is nice seeing people go about their daily lives, kids playing football, making kites, locals running and walking their dogs. It has a relaxed vibe. We didn't visit any bars or clubs, but if you're into that then I'm sure you'll find plenty to amuse you here. "
azoz a,2 contributions,Jul 2017,"Amazing sunset in this beach , and very cool for swimming and surfing There are a lot of bars and horses riding "
dixiepeach,"Kansas City, MO",Jul 2017,This beach is a nice one overall.  The waves are beautiful as they roll in.  It could be better though if pet owners were more responsible about cleaning up after their dogs.
darren a,5 contributions,Jul 2017,"The beach has big waves - good for those who want to try surfing. Sand is not so white but the view is okay. There are umbrellas and benches that you can rent if the sun gets too hot. There are lots of tourists when we visited since it's summer, so it's kinda crowded. You can also run along the coast if your hotel is just nearby."
B P,"Iowa City, IA",Jul 2017,"If you go there expecting white sand beaches, you will be disappointed.  The sand is brown.  The water is somewhat green, not like the exotic beaches in Mexico or Hawaii.  We just walked a bit and left.  "
Maree F,2 contributions,Jul 2017,"Great, love beanbags at sunset, amazing massage by wendy watching all colours of the kites flying high, and surf lessons brilliant"
Jecajess,16 contributions,Jul 2017,"Crowded, dirty, strong tides, and just could be better. People bring their dogs and they are playful with anyone.  Dirty! Empty coconuts and garbage, a better effort should be exorcise to keep this place cleaner.  Too much money is request for a chair and the people in charge can be rude, they want their money! "
Deb L,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Jul 2017,"Loved our morning walks on the beach, watching the dogs play, surf school, and the people going about their business. Busy place but also beautiful. A great way to start the day. "
11Cab11,Brisbane,Jul 2017,"Enjoy sunset cocktails and snacks here on bean bags or table and chairs  on the sand. Prepare to be harassed by sellers of kites, jewellery and kids toys"
NafeeTA,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2017,"This beach although more crowded, its pretty long and has some very nice restaurants lined up near the shore. One can relax here while getting some pretty good grub too"
RPathare,1 contribution,Jul 2017,Beautiful place. Good experience. Great food. Enjoyed  a lot. A must visit when you r in Bali. Beach like never  seen before. Awsome water sports activities. Fun for adventure  lovers.
Andrew,Antarctica,Jul 2017,The waves are too harsh for swimmers and yet too small for seasoned surfers.  The waves are filled with black sand so it tends to stain your clothes and follow you to the hotel. Nightlife is great with a good choice of live bands
PHJTD,"Chippenham, UK",Jul 2017,"This is the first time we have been to Bali and chose the hotel on the basis that it was next to a great beach with good surf. What we hadn't experienced before, however, was a level of concern that swimmers would get into difficulty in the waves and rip that meant that swimming in anything other than ankle deep water immediately attracted a loud whistle blow from the lifeguards. Thankfully we had a pool at the hotel and the kids could go in the sea for surfing lessons but we could not enjoy beautiful waves as much as we wanted. All that said, the sunsets on this beach are amazing and the balance of nightlife, restaurants and shops is just right. Maybe if we had known a bit more about the nature of the rip on the coast we would have gone somewhere else which came better recommended for swimming but then we would have to sacrifice the vibe. "
carole h,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2017,"Love sunsets at Seminyak.Hundreds of people of all ages quietly enjoying the views over the water on this extensive beach - no hassles from traders, just peaceful enjoyment of this beautiful place. Simple pleasures. And free!"
Brijesh24,"Bhubaneswar, India",Jul 2017,You must visit this place to view sunset ! Beach is full of people who gather around 5 pm to click ..
Sulifamily,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,"Busy, beautiful and ever changing. Very good beach.If you are staying somewhere else it's a great experience to visit Seminyak beach"
Peter S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,We visited a few times mostly to enjoy the sunset while enjoying a beer.You can watch surfers and the people enjoying themselves.Parking is cheap if you need it and the local food drink people are friendly
rosco1202,Perth,Jun 2017,Stay @  Tijili Hotel  Jalan  Drupadi  - EXCELLENTcan highly recommend always Location - beach restaurants -Ideal
Pathfinder508728,3 contributions,Jul 2017,"Great for families, plenty of choice for eateries.  Had pizzas and cocktails served to us whilst lounging on bean bags under umbreallas! Clean."
David K,3 contributions,Jul 2017,Great night and great food. Cocktails were good and food was delicious!! Yudi our waiter was a gem and the bar service was sublime
Beth L,"Aberdeen, UK",Jul 2017,We loved the beach with the fantastic bars. The bean bags and umbrellas were really colourful and most bars had live music. Really chilled. Even the beach vendors were fun to watch and not pushy. 
wherearethedans,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,"This was a nice beach, if not a bit touristy. Worth a visit, just to stroll along the beach to see the locals selling their products. "
Ika_deShooters,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Jul 2017,Its one of famous spot for sunset. A little crowded but still good to see sunset.Have may bars on the beach with bean bed.. so u can relax and having a good time
TartanCat57,"Appin, United Kingdom",Jul 2017,Yuck---so many people and no place to sit without someone wanting to charge you. Noisy road next to beach and so much trash. Water not even that warm. Such a disappointment after the lovely beaches elsewhere in Bali. Not sure what the attraction is. 
Jonathan P,31 contributions,Jul 2017,Sunset has changed but still fun. So many bean bags and bintang offers. The beach has always been a great spot for people watching and remains that way. I lo e coming down and spending time watching all the activities
Odyssey463749,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2016,Nice beach. But I would say it's more commercial. We did find our peaceful moment but we would visit it only at sunset like we did. 
Chris A,3 contributions,Jul 2017,It was a little hectic. Very crowded and full of beach clubs pumping loud music. Beaches by Nusa Dua and Uluwatu better.
Anna T,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"Great atmosphere on the beach.  Live band,  but the sands is black oil and the water is dirty.  Couldn't walk on the sand as the feet were black and sticky.  The locals are helpful, polite and fun. "
Mich328,"Park Forest, IL",Jun 2017,"Upon arrival, you pay about .50 to enter. It is worth it. A black temple was fascinating to see. There are loungers and umbrella,too. Go early because the parking lot can become full quickly, if you are driving."
Eka Widya Ristanti,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Visit seminyak, feel free and cool. beautifull beach and the best view in Seminyak Bali Denpasar. please try"
Phil R,"Manchester, UK",Jul 2017,"Don't get me wrong, seminyak beach is stunning with its black sands, amazing sunset and massive waves. But unless you take plenty of food/drink there with you, you're gonna get stung. Unlike kuta beach, it's hard to come by a cheap little place to get a drink or food. There are sunbed spots (which are a bit of a rip off for the bed) where you can get a drink for a fair price, but the beach is mainly dominated by resorts that look like you have to have a lot of cash to stay/eat/drink there. Not only that but I've never known a beach be so hard to access. The shore line is dominated by massive resorts and beach clubs that you just can't get past from the road to the beach. We stumbled across a car park we could cut through to the beach luckily and another time we found a little alley to walk down, but failing that you'd just have to blag your way through a hotel lobby. Ridiculous. Kuta beach gets a bad rep but we had a better day there, it was easily accessible, there was cheaper drink and food everywhere and the sands sea and sunsets were just as nice."
ancyancy,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"The sunsets at Seminyak never disappoints. There's just something about this beach which also explains why all the beach bars along this stretch is always popular and crowded. The only thing that's disappointing is that in late Dec, there's an atrocious amount of rubbish and trash that is washed up onto the beach. We had to clear a tiny spot of plastic bags, wrappers, papers, so that my child can play on the sand. It's gross. This is due to the change in the current and the resorts along the beach tries their best to sweep it every day but you really can't win the ocean.But any other month that I've been there, it's just gorgeous. I'll return again and again."
Paddy J,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,It was a lovely place to go to and relax. Although the guys trying to sell the tourists watched were MOST annoying.
melanie aleman,"Quito, Ecuador",Aug 2016,"The Seminyak area is definitely my preference over Kuta. The restaurants and shops are better, and there are many cool place to hang out with on the beach. I recommend finding a spot with bean bags and hookah. I could be there forever!"
Piyush Patel,"Marrakech, Morocco",Jul 2017,Seminyak beach 🌊 is stunning. It's not white sands but dark volcanic sands. But the good news is no pebbles so easy to walk on without foot wear and very child friendly . The beach is very clean. Negatives not always swimmable the waves are quite high and strong. It's great for surfing and there are many restaurants including Potato Head & Ku Da Te ... 
Linda K,"Wales, UK",Jul 2017,"Seminyak is much quieter than those further down the coast such as Legian and especially Kuta. There are a number of big hotels bordering the beach but also some nice bars and restaurants. Same facilities available as the busier beaches - chairs, umbrellas, surfing, etc. There also seemed to be less beach sellers up here too.Great to wander and sit and watch the world go by in a bar before wandering back again."
Nicole J,"Buderim, Australia",Jul 2017,"Seminyak beach like that whole stretch from Kuta Legian to Seminyak is great. Get a lounge for around $5Aus for 2hrs ( negotiate ) and soak up the sun sea and all the carrying on around you. You can get a cold drink from the guy on the beach you just have to put up with the beach hawkers but if you dont want to buy or have a massage, nails done just so No. Like all the beaches its not the whitest sand but its great. Relax and enjoy."
LDW777,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2017,"We had dinner at La Plancha a great little restaurant by the beach close to the colourful umbrellas, kites and beanbags. Great food and excellent service. Ours was a large group and they accommodated us efficiently."
bobbylou2017,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"we stayed at the katamama hotel, watch sunset from this beach everyday. the most gorgeous sunset in kuta"
Kydroon,"Munich, Germany",Jul 2017,"a wonderful long beach with nice waves, however, the east side of Bali has the wind from the right direction."
vivek662014,"Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India",Jul 2017,I was there with my friends it a nice and fairly clean beach the best part is there is walking lane on the side and many beach shacks for all kind of food and drinks 
Soo Roh,"Cold Lake, Canada",Apr 2017,This beach is peaceful yet lively one surrounded by many resorts and beach bars. We were mostly at the side where Hotel Alila Seminyak was and there were lots of people walking by the beach and enjoy the beautiful scenery. Would love to be back!!
Abang Lexa,"Jembrana, Indonesia",Jul 2017,Just need 30 mnts to looking around and it was just can say wowww😍However traffic is so busy but when i am arrived at pantai Seminyak it make it at all woow🙌🙌🙌🙌
IrelandFailte,Ireland,Jul 2017,Amazing beach. Level flat sea very dangerous due to heavy currents mini spots to swim and surf. High waves. Behind beach there is a big dump well back from beach but needs cleaning. Water quality is very good.
SatishBalakrishnan,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,"Lovely beach with a great sunset view. The tide was decent when we went there. Enjoyed a lot. Just go there around 4 PM And stay till the sun sets, afternoon can be a bit hot."
Jessica C,"Riverwood, Australia",Jul 2017,During my stay in Bali I visited the beach as a scenic experience. Whilst walking the beach I had seen many syringes and litter. I could only imagine what would be in the water if that was on the sand
NWMale12345,"Manchester, UK",Jul 2017,"Bali is a lovely country with friendly people. Seminyak is a lively, trendy place that caters well for all ages and tastes. However, beware on the beach especially that can be full of dog excrement that dog walkers leave and do not pick up. We watched many just leave it, or even cover it with sand. Then, some unsuspecting walker stands in it with bare feet. Not good. As a seasoned, worldwide traveller this is the worst place I have seen with regards animal faeces. The pavements in the town can also be full of the same. It's a shame as it it's the only downside of a great place."
Jacoztraveller,35 contributions,Jul 2017,"This beach is not great, especially down the end with all the beach clubs. Head to Legian or Uluwatu if you want to swim in the ocean. Nice to watch the sunset though and plenty of beach bars to sit and drink. "
Althea M,"Crows Nest, Australia",Jun 2017,"Great sunsets from seminyak beach, with alot of cool bars/ restaurants to enjoy a cocktail and take it all in, my favourite being Ku Te Da. As far as beaches go in Bali i think there is better as this is typically where most people flock to, making it the one of the more run down beaches too."
Adventures_with_Kel,"Belmont, Australia",Jul 2017,We were down the expensive resort end of seminyak so quiet down there. People were flying the big kites 
afdal f,"Depok, Indonesia",Jul 2017,Many cafe/restaurant with sand floor along the beach with many choice off local/Italian/western.Clean beach best place to enjoying sunset or surfing..
Ellen M,29 contributions,Jul 2017,went down to watch the sunset many times - beautiful.saw the lanterns being let off & went to find them but couldnt - would have loved tolet one off.
Anne C,5 contributions,Jul 2017,"Not a beach I would recommend.  There is a terrible smell of phosphate and sewerage, and we decided not to swim in  it for 2 reasons, one the dirty water and two the waves were huge and lots of current.   The waves were envigorating to watch rolling in to the shore. I guess that is a positive. A host of restaurants are scattered  along the beach. Beach loungers available to hire.Most resorts had do not swim signs up, due to currents  and had security staff looking out for those who ignored the signs.  Make sure you choose accommodation that offers a pool."
jmason2017,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2017,"Wonderful Sandy beach, good waves and a tremendous selection of beah restaurents for lunch and sunset. Many happy days spent here."
sunantawu,"Shanghai, China",Jun 2017,A long straight beach with foot-friendly sand.Good for relaxing and for kids to play at.Quite easy to find place to dine in. And also important is access to the airport can avoid  the always congested Kuta and Legian area.
richbb2014,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,Oh what a Rooftop Bar but even better was the Plantation Restaurant one floor below. Fantastic steak and Bomb Alaska and entertainment. Best in Bali.
HorsemanNomad,"Idaho Falls, ID",Jul 2017,We spent several days here and liked this beach way more than Jimbaran Bay.  It is cleaner and has nicer sand and waves.
Kerobokan C,41 contributions,Jul 2017,"We did shopping and late lunch at Urchin Restaurant,  Then we went to the beach crossing a sewer, Indonesia lacks a well planned system as the beach is subject to trash, dogpoo and sewage."
Taniya E,"La Coruna, Spain",Jul 2017,We had a perfect relaxing evening in seminyak sunset beach. Though due to clouds sun set was not clear enough. It was perfect view and lots of multi clr bean bag restaurants are there with different styles of entertainment. Some hVe Good musics. 
GILIBUANAHostel12,"Gili Air, Indonesia",Jul 2017,good ...all is good and comfort to stay amd sleep amd eating. i will recommend my friend if visit bali stay at this hotel at seminyak
PhixyBoy,3 contributions,Jul 2017,Beautiful beach during in Bali. We enjoy for swim and sunset...This place good for family. And peoples was friendly
shaniecexoxo,"Coventry, UK",Jul 2017,"Big waves so you need to be careful when going out. Water is not crystal clear however is clean enough for an enjoyable visit. Thanks for reading , Shaniece . "
Jean H,"Limerick, Ireland",Jul 2017,"The whole beach had a dirty feel, especially around the many 'rivers' that flow down to the ocean and smell very strong. The beach clubs were nice with beanbags and music but honestly I couldn't wait to get away from the area.Will be staying at my hotel pool tomorrow."
joysybabe,"The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, UK",Jul 2017,"Thought the beach was dirty with rubbish and broken glass, and I was dismayed at the number of dogs running freely on beach at all times of day. Not a patch as gorgeous as I expected. "
Tom T,3 contributions,Jul 2017,During our vacation We looked for some authentic food and found it. Tested very good. We will come back. 
Kangen S,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"Great spot to see sunset, many spot to learn how to surf, easy to buy drinks and snack at convinjence store, come here already 5 times"
Maximilian K,61 contributions,Jul 2017,The beach would be nice but too many people trying to sell you something. It felt like getting asked every 5 meters if we want to surf. 
Brent S,"Chandler, AZ",Jul 2017,The kids enjoyed this beach. No pushy sales people.  Surf lessons available.  Bar and restaurant choices along the beach and within walking distance. 
Cherrykidz,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"great place to hang, drink while catching sunset or just simply enjoy your sunset while walking on the beach."
Greg Massacra,"Galway, Ireland",Jul 2017,"It is nice beach for first visit when you arrive on Bali, but there is a lot of coral pieces in sand so Its hard to walk on beach without flip flops on. Apart from that its lovely as all Bali. They are serving drinks, beach boys are not too annoying like for example in Kenya. "
DaniLL,"Lydney, UK",Jul 2017,"My husband & I watched the sun go down from Seminyak beach this evening, my gosh it was outstanding. It's very busy, in the car park outside you can purchase authentic Balinese street food. On the beach, there are couples, families, groups of friends, dogs, you name it.It really is a place for all.The waves are spectacular & great for surfers & spectators alike. Definately worth a visit! "
Esmaeil F,"Sharjah, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2017,watching the surfersEating your corn on the beachHaving a drink in one of the bars thereFeel the waves
FrankandTonia,"Ashburton, New Zealand",Jul 2017,There's something about Bali Beaches that makes them a bit special: The people.Yes there are a few hawkers but they are not pushy and add to the charmThe sand and surf are good but you should check the safe areas for swimming 
Rollin Adventures,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is very Overated. There are much better beaches in Bali. Coming from the Sunshine Coat in Australia, we don't frequent Bali for the beach. Mainly suited for those who ""have to be seen"" in Seminyak. Lots of eateries and shopping in the area."
Paul W,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,Very surprised at how clean this beach was. Excellent surf beach with plenty of places to hire boards etc. Peaceful and not harassed. Kids had a great time.
westluxnick,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Visited many times 66 beach rooftop,Cocoon,two or three restaurants on the beach,all good venues,sunset there a must."
Paul C,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,A good semi-surf type of beach with not a lot of vendors on it. The hotel restaurants are close by with easy access.
Robyn,27 contributions,Dec 2016,"This was the first beach I went to in Bali and I expected a lot more from it. We did go in December, but I found that it was very dirty and didn't really like being there. We walked up and down, then went and found something else to do"
nsl115,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2017,A very long stretch of beach with blackish sand and turbulent waters with strong waves. Lovely to watch the waves come into the beach and fun to be in the water and have the waves crash over you but do look out for the strong currents.The sunset is quite spectacular so well worth catching this.We couldn't find any good public baths or toilets which is an area the tourist promotion board should look into. However there are restaurants and cafes along the beach that you could use but no shower facilities or changing rooms that we could find.
Melanieh910,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2017,"Unfortunately the day that I first visited was after a big down pour, the rubbish was phenomenal and sad."
Pedro A,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"We visited in the first day we arrived to Bali and it is dark sand beach with good waves for surfers. But in Bali you have much nicer white sand beaches (Nusa Dua, ...)"
sfarisah,"Hua Hin, Thailand",Jul 2017,"This beach are much better than kuta beach..more calm, clean and not congested.However, to get there you need to walk a bit or take taxi/ motocycle...i entered the beach area via kudeta enterance..Worth for evening walk"
jrpt93,"Brentwood, UK",Jul 2017,"The beach has lovely sand, however it is not good for swimming. It's more of a surfing beach, the waves are very large sometimes. I preferred Legian beach although Seminyak beach seemed to be clearer to see the sunset. (Might have been weather related) "
Sam V,"Schilde, Belgium",Jun 2017,"If you like surfing, go there. Big waves!If you like snorkeling, don't. You'll only see sand. Beach is all but sand, comfortable when you go into sea. "
Jo B,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,"Whether you want to walk along the beach, go surfing, sit and have a drink or eat a meal, you will find what you want on Seminyak beach. The foreshore is lined with little eateries and bars overlooking the ocean. During the day there are sun lounges and umbrellas. At night there are beanbags and coloured lights out on the sand where you can dine or enjoy a quiet drink. Some places have live music that can be heard from the surrounding venues. You will also be visited by a range of locals trying to sell you anything from sarongs to toys or watches. Just say no thanks if you're not interested. "
Carol P,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"I have been to Bali many times but never to Seminyak. We walked down to the beach down a very busy road and near the entrance to the beach it was extremely busy and you have to watch for scooters and vehicles, it seems the private drivers park along the street and therefore makes it hard to walk along pavements. The beach was very long and there are lots of bars with bean bags and tables to sit and watch the breathtaking show of the sunset. It was a good place to watch the people walking by and others trying to get the best photo. I found the sand to be a grey colour which made your feet look dirty and very difficult to brush off. There are a lot of local people selling their goods which can get annoying. I was not overwhelmed by this beach and on our way back to the road via the path which runs behind the bars a enormous rat ran across our path. I think in future I'll watch the sunset from some place else."
Tejaldaftary,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2017,"If you are a surfer, you have to go to Bali and visit the beaches - one of them being Seminyak. The waves are good for beginners as well as people who surf regularly. "
Jacques du Toit,"Pretoria, South Africa",Apr 2017,"Great spot to surf in the mornings and a very relaxed atmosphere. Always barter for surfboards and sun loungers. By the time we got the hang of it, we consistently paid IR100k for a lounger and surfboard for the ENTIRE day. In the beginning we paid that for an hour, etc. So just keep walking if they don't agree - you'll get your price. But do it respectfully."
cheyennewyn,"Balakong, Malaysia",Apr 2017,One of my favourite spots to watch the sunset in Bali. It's always busy but I still love it! Love the vibe there!
Nicholas,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,Seminyak Beach is a great place to have a drink and watch the sunset. Also good place to go with family and friends.
Pamela R,18 contributions,Jun 2017,This beach is very good for a quick dip but predominately for surfers. That in itself is good because there is always something to see while your there. There are an abundance of bars on the beach and they all seem good. Street food is available if your game or you can bring your own. The downside is that there a lot of beach vendors who will approach you. Buts thats everywhere in bali. Overall we had a great time there on many occasions.
SangiTani,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2017,"This beach was clean with beautiful sunset views. Me and my daughter spent almost 3 hours at beach, U can relax near the shore there are paid benches available.  Book your chair and watch the sunset. Great place to catch some waves when the surfs up. There are local vendors for coconut water, beer, corn etc. my daughter went for local braids done by local Indonesian personal. It was overall enjoyable place."
sonalshomakash,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is a public beach & has everything to offer for every age. It has many open air restaurants on beach to drink & dine with LIVE music & enjoy the ambience. Across the road you have plenty more open air restaurants. Water is cleaner than Kuta beach. Best part is you can walk from seminyak beach to kuta beach, it is that long....However, this beach is for surfing only, not recommended for swimming. I personally liked this beach more than Kuta beach."
Firly I,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"If you want to see the sunset then this is a great place for you,  but i reckon the beach is so busy and a bit dirty its kinda hard to walk slowly and enjoying the view. "
Vivi G,"County Dublin, Ireland",Jun 2017,"We were in Seminyak on our honeymoon and we really loved the beach. The water is nice sandy and clean and we were like kids enjoying the crazy, strong waves with other people, it was lots of fun. On the other side you won't get much privacy to enjoy the sunset from the sellers.. They are constantly there and standing front of you cover the view.. not so romantic.."
stargazer62,"Coventry, UK",Jun 2017,Quite gritty sand more for surfers I think. Went at sundown but it was quite cloudy. Our children (20 & 25 ) went three times & loved it. 
GillHNewcastle,"Tynemouth, UK",Jun 2017,"The beach is long and wide but was pretty dirty at the seminyak part - it seemed cleaner the further towards kuta you went which was surprising. There were loads of bathroom waste items like toothpaste tubes and nappies and even a hypodermic needle on one part. Lots of hawkers too - the closer to kuta the more persistent they were. We headed off to jimbaran, padang padang and other quieter more pleasant spots for a day on the beach."
Daniel H,"Mernda, Australia",Jun 2017,"Wow what a beautiful beach i recomend it to couples from Australia to experience the Seminyak Beach.Especially on the sunset,just the crowd of locals and tourists is mind boggling and sitting there having a mocktail or bintang is the true Bali experience.All the beach markets and locals trying there best to make ends meet in selling there cultural gifts,be there at least an hour before sunset to get your lounge chair and mocktail."
Mark H,"Enmore, Australia",Jun 2017,"This was my third & last visit as this sad beach has not got cleaner. Only go if you want the experience of swimming with plastic & faeces. Miles & miles of bottles & trash. The locals ignore the waste blaming it on tides bringing pollution from Java or the rain washing trash down from the mountains. Whatever the cause, they do nothing about it.BTW the stray dogs that live on the beach are treated cruelly. Another reason not to go."
Andre H,8 contributions,Jun 2017,"Upside: lovely beach with loads of loungers & umbrellas for rent. Many delightful restaurants with wide variety of cuisine at reasonable prices. Downside: The beach can do with some business community participation to clean up plastic and other rubbish. The hawkers (although respected for their role) are mostly over-pushy and bordering annoying. Three times saying ""no thank you"" with a smile, should be enough. It is unpleasant elevating your blood pressure over something as stupid as this while supposed to relax.  "
Satish Chander,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2016,If your looking for a place to spent quality time the this is the place for you. Make sure you enter the beach from Potato Head beach club. You can spent hours sitting here with you partner looking at the sunset. Don't forget to bring umbrella if you don't like the rain.
AliciaVC,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2017,"Seminyak is a black sand beach with huge waves, making it great for surfing or bodyboarding. Gets lovely sunsets with being on the west coast. There are some cool beach bars scattered along the beach, giving it a similar vibe to a Thai island. Busy and touristy, but much cleaner than other beaches in Bali!"
Darnel-HDI,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,Located next to Kuta Beach. Seminyak is crowded with do many viditor. Tje beach just average. Not so clean.
Mansi S,23 contributions,Jun 2017,Nice for sunset but can get crowded if you don't stay in the resorts but just visit the beach. The area in front of resorts is clean and not that crowded so if visiting try finding a quiet spot and enjoy the sunset
chanda01,"Bengaluru, India",Jun 2017,"The beach looks just perfect. Best to fly a kite or just sit on a bean bag at one of the many beach clubs around, sip a drink and look at the beautiful sunset. Many hawkers here though."
Bryan2211,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is cleaner than most other beaches, and nice surf. Not overcrowded and the surf was also nice. It's got a beautiful sunset - when it's not too cloudy. Worth a visit when you are in Bali."
Deb M,"Kalaru, Australia",Jun 2017,We went down to Seminyak Beach to spend the day and swim - it was such a shame the beach was so littered with rubbish and the local sellers just did not leave you alone!!
Shane S,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,Lovely. Seminyak is very friendly and plenty to see eat and do..double six beach is a must. I recommend Annora villas for a magical time in Bali....
BeautifulBernard,Singapore,Jun 2017,"We spent an amazing couple of days enjoying Kuta Beach, Seminyak. The sand isn't powder white because of the volcanic sand and it could do with a beach clean but the waves totally make up for it. Our young daughters really enjoyed jumping in, over and ""surfing"" the waves back to shore.The beach sellers also have everything you could want from Sarongs to beer and arwn't too pushy."
Kevin,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2017,"Seminyak has a lovely beach, a lot nicer than the beach in Kuta in my opinion. Sunbeds are cheaper here too. Loads of cool bars along the beach front too :)"
Vanitha,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2017,Black sand beach with high current. Super place for surfing! During High tides you will see lots of surfers. Sand is black as volcanic sand. Seminyak square and a nice night life makes this a good choice to spend your day here ! 
Judith S,"New South Wales, Australia",Jun 2017,"Have been to Bali a few times but never stayed at Seminyak so thought it would be a good idea this time around. Seminyak is certainly more lay back than it's two rivals (Legian and Kuta) but unfortunately, like the rest of Bali, the most obvious thing is the RUBBISH all over this beach. There appears to be minimal respect for what people dispose of and what's washed up on the shore. I did notice a front loader attempting to clear some of the rubbish at high tide AM, which doesn't appear at low tide when the rubbish is more evident. Once again, it's all about the money rather than the paradise that people flock here for, and with more and more tourists hitting this little island, if something isn't done this will only get worse. This will be my last time visiting this island as I find it very distressing to see the abuse of animals, nature and little respect for the Eco system that this island has to offer."
Ruchi890,"Moradabad, India",Apr 2017,"If you are looking for peace and tranquility, this is the place to be . Nice , calm , refreshing and relaxing , seminayak is the refined form of kuta which is noisy and crowded . Stay in seminayak if all you want is quite and calm . A completely different form of Bali and it's culture.lovely place to be . Just go for a stroll on the beach even if you are staying in kuta . "
almago6,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"The beach at Seminyak is over crowded and dirty, lots of rubbish washing up. The redeeming fact is if you're staying on the beach it's great to watch the sun go down"
RonnieYang,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Touts throng the beach at Kuta and at Tanjong Benoa, but not at Seminyak. Its a lot more peaceful. The beach is so clean that it is safe to jog barefoot!The sunsets are also amazing. The beach side establishments: Ku De Ta and Potato Head also lend to the laid back, yet happening atmosphere to the beach.This beach is way better than the one at Kuta. Definitely worth a visit."
Jem Coco food and travel adventures,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017," One of my favourite things to do is go to the beach so I have visited many beaches in different countries. I was shocked to see a beach like this in Asia. Now I know for a fact that it is true with what people say, Bali is known more for their resorts and not their beaches."
mimi_mechosem,gurgaon,May 2017,"Seminyak is Bali's most fashionable beach, home to among the island's luxurious resorts and host to a number of fine restaurants and boutiques. Fashion stores and top dining spots.Seminyak's Petitenget Beach offers a more secluded ambiance compared to its sister strands of Kuta and Legian to the south.Evening scene more nice."
tonyv6,"Newport, UK",Jun 2017,"Beautiful clean beach,plenty of small bars with bean bags and sunloungers,barter on the price for sunloungers typically they say 150000rp got them down to 100000rp which when converted to english pounds is about £6.50 which is really cheap.Definitely recommend seminyak beach."
gavs23,"Canberra, Australia",Jun 2017,"What a let down. Terrible surf. Dirty, greyish sand and rubbish everywhere. I don't know if it's the locals or the tourists...probably both...but why do people treat the planet as a giant garbage dump?"
bootsy1989,28 contributions,Jun 2017,"We loved this beach ! However expect to be asked every 2 minutes literally to buy things ... if your girlfriend loves to sun bathe and you get a bit bored though this is a good way to keep busy so i really didn't mind we caught some rays and listened to some nice music ... on our own speaker that is , the beds were really comfy and we didn't get hasseled by the people's beds we used they were really nice :) we'll be back "
Isuru palliyaguru,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2017,Place like no other :) it was great 6 days we were spending in seminyak bali.. Allways great food and drinks and fantastic service almost each and every restaurant we went .. highly recommended  holiday destination .cheers 
Sudhan R,20 contributions,Jun 2017,Good and beautiful... Not so deep.. It's shallow for some distance.. Its not a blue one.. Can enjoy a beautiful sunset
geromam,"Geraldton, Australia",Jun 2017,We decided to walk from Seminyak beach to Kuta Beach. Average speed. Took a couple of hours as we had to take refuge under beach umbrellas from the rain. Credit to people cleaning up as hardly any litter on the sand. Water looked clean but not sure with water from the roads flowing straight into the ocean. Not too many dogs running around the morning we went. Maybe the rain put them off?
Jarkko L,"Espoo, Finland",Jun 2017,"Great place for surfing, usually big waves especially in the Legian direction (where most of the surf schools are). Often red flags for swimming due to waves. Great fine sandy beach for sunbathing. Lots of beach bars/restaurants."
Shivi G,"Toronto, Ontario",Aug 2016,"This beach has the most amazing views and just so many neat places to eat and activities to do. Not as clear as the Pandava beach, but definitely beautiful! "
Syme0n,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,"If there's even such a word. Bali is home to a multitude of scenic sunset views and Seminyak isn't shy of holding quite a few records of stunning photographic opportunities. Take a stroll after breakfast or just before dinner when the sun is about to set and I can guarantee you that your life's perspective would change. Clean sandy white beaches, azure blue skies and the deep vast ocean blue are just a couple of things that would rope beach-goers and water sports enthusiasts."
Henry S,Jakarta,Jun 2017,"The beach is nice and so huge area, it means the long beach there..There is a beautiful sunset there and good for family activity...There are couples bar and lounge to enjoy during sun down..The beach also clean, with the beautiful white sands"
Kristine Li • The Petite Wanderess,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"Went to this particular stretch of the beach and I actually find Seminyak beach much better than Kuta's beach which I had visited years ago. Seminyak beach wasn't as dirty as I imagined from the reviews, I didn't really see rubbish in the sea or dead fishes washed ashore (as seen at Kuta)?!? Waves were huge in the evening so it's definitely not for swimming, but the sunset was beautiful! There were no hawkers trying to sell us stuff too, as compared to Kuta's constant stream of persistent hawkers."
dananghagni,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Some said that the beach is filthy, but i think the Seminyak is still can be consider as clean, both that there were not any garbage and trash, and also there were not many locals trying to sell you things unlike in Kuta.good and wide space, the beach is perfect for waiting sunset, and just sitting around enjoying oneself or letting your kid plays with the sands.the wave is quite big in the middle, not suitable for swimming, specially for kids, but it will be a perfect spot for surfing."
Robin T,"Glasgow, UK",Jan 2017,My wife and I selected and booked a luxury hotel on the beach as we enjoyed a beach holiday and swimming in the sea. We were most disappointed with the filth along the whole of Seminyak beach and in the sea. On enquiry we were told that the waste were wash ashore from another part of Indonesia. If you want a beach holiday in Bali this is not a place to go. Will not return and will not recommend tourist to go 
Helena,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2017,"Big waves, kind of crowded and lots of people wanting to sell you stuff. I'm not a surfer so I found it hard to appreciate the beach although I understand that surfers do. Wouldn't recommend it if you're not used to swimming with big waves and it's suitable for children."
drwols,"Gloucester, UK",Jun 2017,"Similar to Petitenget beach, just a little busier. Sea is too rough to swim in, but great for surfing. If you've visited other beaches in South East Asia, this isn't worth making a special effort to visit "
JoJo,California,Jun 2017,"This beach was nice for drinks at night but as far as the water goes it was a bit rough. The waves were small but the undertow was mighty. Also, if you think you are far enough back you are not. Take a look around and see where the chairs are placed and know that the water will come up to and sometimes past them. At night we saw a couple of rows of beanbag chairs and tables being taken into the ocean. It was funny until you realized that the customers not only lost their drinks but possibly their cell phones too. "
Sarah2424111,"Horsham, UK",Jun 2017,A few bars and some market stalls clean beach would go again. Not many 'sellers'  hassling you to buy their wares unlike at kuta beach 
dipalihanda,5 contributions,Jun 2017,Nice beach. It was calm and clean and not so crowded. Very beautiful sunset there . We enjoyed there. Some one was flying kite and another was playing with the dog.
DexterD2013,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jun 2017,"The beach shelves away quite steeply here and results in 'dumpy' waves that wouldn't be great for small children and isn't that conducive to swimming.A nice beach to go for a walk on although there are lots of beach umbrellas and loungers set out during the day, so you are best to go early in the morning when it also a bit cooler."
Maria H,8 contributions,Jun 2017,Walking distance from our villa....Sand a little rough and dark....Plenty of chairs at beach to hire for the day.Great surf...lovely warm water.All you need there..
Leicaman8,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,Great beach to watch the spectacular sunsets especially from cool beach clubs like ku de ta and potato head. These beach clubs are more pricy but they are recommended top end clubs . There are numerous cheap eating places and massages done on the beach . Good beach for morning or evening walks to people watch . 
sandrajago,"Anglesea, Australia",Jun 2017,"went specifically for  the surf, and is for experienced surfers only. My son who has surfed all over the world found it quite dangerous. The beach was closed for surfing on a few days and would recommend early mornings as being the best time to go.   "
Xena,17 contributions,Jun 2017,"My friend and I got a sun-bed for 200k Indonesian Rupees for the whole day - that's 100k each, we tried other beaches around the area and the prices asked were about the same; you can, if you're up to, bargain the prices a little bit though. The guy, who lent us the sunbeds took great care of our things too - the one time our shoes were washed away by a wave, so he secure them for us, etc. The beach is amazing to have a sundowner drink, the bars/restaurants will let you then sit on a beanbag at the beach with some fancy small umbrellas - super cute. "
Abi B,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is really nice In my option, not quite the tranquil paradise like beach you think of when visiting Bali but this place has a really good surf beach which is clean and fun. The best part of Seminyak beach is at night, it really does come to life. Everyone gathers to watch the sun set drinking beers on all the bean bags they put out, really great atmosphere and amazing sun set!"
SaketPandit,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,Seminyak Beach is lovely in many ways. There aren't too many hawkers bothering you but at the same time there's plenty of shacks to get a drink or some fresh coconut water. Definitely recommended!
AnnMarieGrace,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,My husband and I took our 1 and 2 year old to the beach in morning and we had a spectacular time. I don't think it is one of the prettiest beaches I have been to though we still had fun.We brought sand toys from one of the market stores which we used to dig and build castles and in the water along the shore we jumped the waves while watching the surfers. It was early (830-1030am) in the morning that we didn't get hassled by any sales people.I have been to Seminyak beach in the evening with the kids for dinner and drinks as well. We did get a lot of people coming up us trying to sell us things. My husband had enough whereas I didn't mind it was window browsing for me while I sat and enjoyed my cocktail. They were great as they didn't bother the kids who again played with the beach toys.
Sathesh K,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2017,"It's a very nice place to visit. The sand is very fine, it feels very comfortable to walk on. The water that touches the shore is very clear. The whole beach is a great place to play, walk in. "
Paula B,"Leeds, UK",Jun 2017,Not as great as TripAdvisor would suggest sadly. The bars around are pretty cool but the amount of rubbish spoils the experience.
Adrie L,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,"Went there for lunch and dinner for separate occasions. May not be the nicest beach in Bali but there are nice and inexpensive places to eat, rest and relax in the heat. "
Martha Elena T,13 contributions,Jun 2017,"Its filthy literally see diapers along the beach., sales people pushing to sale stuff, trust me you dont want to take home a horrible image of Bali"
ErinOz,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,When you live in Australia the beaches of Bali don't really compare to what we have at home. Seminyak's great for beach bars to watch the sunset but it's not the crystal clear water haven that can be found on many neighbouring islands. 
Laurie S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"Visited twice, both times before dusk. Bit cloudy on the horizon so the sunset was not really beautiful although once was pretty good. But the beach itself is great - wide, flattish & genuinely one of the great beaches of my life especially in the late afternoon. Maybe not spotlessly clean but better than those in my Melbourne experience. Romantic & exotic as well as great weather always - quite vibrant too with so many things happening on the beach."
ukrania,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jun 2017,"If you're looking for fairytale white sand and see through glass water, not the place..if you are looking for chilled out party vibe,ok swimming, easy surfing it's great..good place to hang out soak up some sun and good vibes...think way toned down, cleaner, Kuta..you can rent a board for 50k, there are low pressure beach peddlers that are accepting to a polite no thank you, you can get 2 beds/umbrella/table for 50k an hour, bean bag bars at sunset are great...check it out"
Fruzsina S,22 contributions,Jun 2017,"Nice and less crowded than Kuta Beach, we were there several times. Also next to the beach there is a street with full of nice hotel resorts, we we usually had dinner. The sunset is awesome :) "
Happyfacea,"Hervey Bay, Australia",Jun 2017,Beach was quite dirty and smelly. I would not swim there or even walk on the sand. Good markets there
Peteski2016,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Apr 2017,"This is a nice beach for sundowners and surfers - not a swimming beach as a result of the surfers although you could have a quick dip at sunset when the surfers stop - nice sand and a great walk - lots to see and do - pictures and there are the beach vendors but they are very nice.............lots of clubs and restaurants along the beach W, Potatohead etc. La Laguna Restaurant and small independents - you will find something you love here............"
Preetikh,24 contributions,Jun 2017,"Stunning sunset, wonderful ambience as you sit on bean bags provided by the beach shacks, relax have a drink, surf swim!!"
Carmencita222,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2017,"My boyfriend and I much prefer this beach over the many others we have been to thus far. In the evening the whole vibe on the beach is wonderful... lots of live music, hooka, beanbag chairs and lanterns you can light to the sky if you choose. "
surfsteve7,"Coolum Beach, Australia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak Beach is THE  place to go for a  "" sundowner ""  . This is Aussie slang for a great place to be to watch the sunset and be a part of the day turning to night . For many this is a significant part of the day . With a great choice of Bars  Restos  and other attractions you are spoiled by the array of eating drink and just plain hanging out options .   Be careful if you have children as all beaches are a risk ."
LorinE-lovestotravel,"Sunbury, Australia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak beach is very picturesque.  Long expanse of white sand, dotted with beach clubs, restaurants and hawkers selling their wares.  You can sit in bean bag chairs with a Bintang and watch the sunset.  There was one man selling black Pirate Ship kites that looked amazing floating over the ocean.  The waves are very strong, I just walked into the water a little way and the pull from the waves nearly had me off my feet.  The water is a great temperature."
Salina A,38 contributions,Jun 2017,The views of the beach are stunning day or night. Unfortunately there is rubbish along the beach and some has washed up. Such a shame that people using the beach aren't better disposing of rubbish. The beach can be crowded in parts but the upside is you can book activities easily or buy a drink. There are bars and hotels along the beach too. It is a must see spot. Enjoy! 
jedoanuta j,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Seminyak Beach has great sunsets. The water is very polluted, the beach is mostly very very dirty. Be careful if you have kids, strong rips and the water is filthy"
LarsLyngse,"Copenhagen, Denmark",May 2017,"Beautiful beach with white sand but heavy waves - recommendable for surfers, but not for children and families. "
Natasha B,5 contributions,Jun 2017,My children are quite young and the beach wasn't really suitable for swimming but they still loved the walks..... 
Kirsty S,"St. Albans, UK",Aug 2016,"Stayed here for our wedding, took our vows  overlooking the sea and couldn't have asked for better scenery.The sea is rough but I happily swam. Great for people watching. Lots of happy memories."
Mary M,"Pacific Pines, Australia",May 2017,Hired a driver to show us around for the day and landed here ...the beach was ok but the hawkers hit you as soon as you try to get comfortable ....massage hair nails the works ....nice to just relax
Elizabeth P,"Margate, UK",Jun 2017,"The beach is beautiful and the waves high but I tried swimming and it wasn't pleasant. The sunloungers are about 150k for 2 all day which is a lot. The people selling things are a  bit much but you have ro pretend to sleep! They are nice people but persistent and they are friendly. Bali is quiet right now due to a  terrorist attack in Jakarta and the people are feeling it so it's difficult to be annoyed. The sea was also brown in places, it looked like cooking oil. There are lots of stray dogs all over Bali including the beach which is heartbreaking."
Syawalianto,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2017,"The beach is less crowded compare to Kuta. The waves are decent for beginner to start learning how to surf. Many vendors for board rentals, and the boards are much better shape compare to those in Kuta. I paid 50k IDR for 1 hour of long board soft top rental. But negotiated for lower rate when I rent more than 1 board or took it longer than 1 hour. Lot's of cafes too on the beach ground so you can relax and enjoy watching sunset afterwards. No public shower place, if I am not mistaken (Kuta has them).Lately people are complaining about the thrash in Bali beaches. When I ask a local, he said that there is periodical clean-ups of these beaches. So just before this you might encounter a very dirty beach. But I guess most of the time they are allright."
vs-gurgaon,gurgaon,May 2017,"although a public beach.. But it was nice and clean.. NO water sports or acclivities can be done.. Just go for enjoying the sea, waves and maybe a stroll on the beach"
Filipa A,7 contributions,Jun 2017,"Bad beach, very dirty and impossible to bath. The sand is dark and filled with garbage.There are sewers that enter directly at the beach and provide a terrible smell "
Mehdi T,"Casablanca, Morocco",Jun 2017,"Interesting beach, quiter than Kuta but still busy at sunset. You can get a bed for 50krp, and get fresh drinks. Depending on where you stay, it's pretty accessible. Also the sand isn't volcanic like other beaches in Bali. "
Marnauli T,3 contributions,May 2017,"the beach is more clean and less people that kuta beach.in the afternoon, the cafe will put many beanBags in the beach so you can sit and enjoy the sunset"
rob1528,"Widnes, UK",Jun 2017,Lovely beach with a great sunset and live acoustic music at the bars at night bean bags on the beach this is the place to chill out at night 
deepforezt,"London, UK",May 2017,"I don't normally like to give bad reviews. But here you have to. Long beach with lot of restaurants and other outlets. But people will pester you to buy their products. At some point you will get irritated. Now coming back to the beach, it is dirty and lot of waste here and there lying around. Not clean at all. Rubbish all through the sand. . This beach is for new comers. Those who hasn’t experienced what a real good beach or sea side will call it great as I have seen some of the reviewers do. But if you have gone to Mauritius, Seychelles or some islands in Thailand then you will know what clean beaches do look like. Have been to many beaches around the world. But really disappointed with the way they kept the bay. Same with Kutta beach as well. Sunset is the only good thing you can say about this beach. There are lot of hotels on the line of beach side which has pool. Try to get a room there and sit and relax in the pool side as they are much better."
Steve_Mathieson,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2017,"I love the atmosphere of Seminyak, not so busy as Kuta but with plenty of scope for all things esecially the beachside eateries"
HEtraveler,"Carmel, IN",May 2017,This is a nice beach for walking on the sand. It's relatively flat with high waves that moves back-and-forth. Not that suitable for swimming. Probably good for surfing. Sunset view is spectacular. I enjoyed it.
Rasha S,"Amman, Jordan",Jun 2017,Can rent sun beds easily alwaus ask for half price they accept. Coconut water is a must u can take ur own drinks easily. Massage ladies can be annoying but try to be nice they will go away :)for buying anything ask for hapf price alwaaaaays
Carlee Wilson,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"Love this beautiful beach. So much to enjoy. Many places to enjoy a cold drink, great good and enjoy the sunset and swimming. "
Chris C,"Noosa, Australia",May 2017,"Polluted streams spoil this beach esp just south of Ku De Ta. Streams help the surf but even so there was little shape and strong currents sometimes just sideways, other times sideways and taking you way out to sea. Definitely not a place for a real swim unless unusually calm. Not too crowded"
sumirejay,"London, UK",Jul 2016,This beach is popular with a lot of the young people saying nearby in hotels but it avoids the overcrowded feeling in many European beaches as it is wide and well catered by staffs of the on beach hotels. The surface isnt too rough and the water is warm. Charming to walk here in the evening or go for a shisha 
biljanalab,"Skopje, Republic of North Macedonia",Apr 2017,it is nice beach with a lot of bars where you can spend you time. most of people are tourists. have great sunset.
tastraveller20152015,"Hobart, Australia",May 2017,Very crowded beach with it difficult to find a place to sit without having to pay for the privilege.
Ross&JessL,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"We stayed 10 nights this year , we stayed last year as well, still a nice hotel close to everything pool great , beach across the road with bands at night  , the rooms cleaned everyday , staff friendly and accommodating , breakfast was ok , They had a wedding group aussies at the hotel at the same time , they were wild but harmless at the pool , luckily they only partied at the pool one day , this is not a complaint just what we experienced , the pool staff controlled the situation ,all in all still a great hotel, thanks again puri saron Great place to relax and unwind "
Linda H,"Port Augusta, Australia",May 2017,"The beach is generally clean and there is room for everyone. There are sun lounges and umbrella, bean bags and kites flying overhead. You can even have a surf lesson. There are some hawkers, but they go away if unwanted.  Great sunsets."
Omokoroa23,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2017,Open sewers running into water. Rubbish and not the best quality sand. Dirty I'd say. The water and waves were excellent when we were there. 
Jeffrey B,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2017,"Just relaxing having a drink by the beach they have Umbrella deck chairs and seats, surf lessons if that's what interests you.You can have breakfast overlooking the water I walked from my Villa various market stalls along the way "
SantosPaul,"Toronto, Canada",Jun 2017,I found this to be a bit overrated...great if you are coming from Australia...close by. Coming from far...other options for sure.I did like Legion beach...again...not the tropical paradise one might be thinking of finding. Good place to chill and go clubbing.
Lourose73,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"A really lovely beach, but be warned you get absolutely hassled by beach vendors trying to sell you anything and everything."
Meredith H,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2017,"To me this beach is just as busy and has just as much sales people on it as Kuta and Legian. My boys that surf said the wave break was better.  However to sit on the beach and watch the sunset it is nice but again to me, no better than the other beaches.  Probably a bit nicer places to sit, lots more bean bags rather than plastic chairs."
Gloria B,"Hanoi, Ha Noi, Vietnam",May 2017,We visited the beach at sunset. The beach was very crowded. However the disturbing thing is the bad smell from the sewage system which runs directly to the sea. I think local gov must do something about this to keep the beach clean and safe
IanTwee,"Durban, South Africa",May 2017,We expected more from what was posted as an attractive beach.The surf was high but on our visits unridable.A trip to Double 6 was definitely a better bet
gaynorjohn2003,"Leyland, UK",May 2017,Quite disappointed Litter is a problem from offerings on the beachVery strong currents so not recommended for swimming unless a very confident swimmerWe attempted to find a nicer beach with a more tropical image
GeoffO,"Maroochydore, Australia",May 2017,"Much nicer beach than on the eastern side of the island at Sanur but water is sometimes very rough with signs out prohibiting swimming. Plenty of board riders though and although the tide comes in and out a fair distance, the sand is a little dark, but walking to Kuta or Potato Head is easy with plenty of lounges available all along the beach.The sunsets are amazing and of course the area is famous for them."
antinmk,"Milton Keynes, UK",May 2017,"Very clean beach, everyday (10 days) the sea was rough but plenty of people surfing. The one down side is the ""looky looky sellers"" keep asking you if you would like to buy there products, which range from a cheap bracelet to Bow & arrow! "
LeeWilkesisHere,"Ampthill, UK",May 2017,"The sunset is amazing. But yet each can be quite dirty in places.Tends to be better outside of the private beach clubs.If you can get a hotel or villas to allow you onto their private part of the beach, this is your best bet if you want to spend a whole day there.During the wet season, the currents bring lots of rubbish to the beach, so do your research and check your seasons!"
lifewelltraveller,"Hong Kong, China",May 2017,Perfect sunset beach. Walking along the beach from Ku De Ta to Petitinget Temple and looking the sun sets into the sea is amazing.
JJMumbai,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2017,The Seminyak public beach is quite clean. There are several hotels with private beach adjacent to the public beach. 
sarvysweet,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2017,Clean beach and good for swim.  Nice restaurants in the beach with bean bags thrown around for sitting   Not expensive   Good beach for candid pictures   Good market parallel to the beach 
3009jimmac,"Long Jetty, Australia",May 2017,Love Seminyak area and have stayed 6 times. However the actual beach is spoilt somewhat with plastic bag rubbish. 
Vincent M,5 contributions,May 2017,Enjoying my time here.  Staff is helpful by far the most comfortable bed and the shower is amazing.  They have free shuttle buggie to beach and market. Liquor store right across the street 
AsiaTravelHero,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2017,"Long beach along Seminyak. Unfortunately Bali is so busy, the beach here didn't seem to get looked after. Lots of plastic bags, rubbish and even glass found on the beach. Unfortunate. The touts along the beach were also trying to charge ridiculous money for beach chairs. Advice would be to ignore the ones that are near the entry points to the beach and speak to the sellers further away. The price continuously drops as you say no to each beach chair mafia person."
Asiaunknown_com,"Bangkok, Thailand",May 2017,The beach is beautiful That is in front of the private tourist properties.  Sadly the beach in front of the property owner by the locals such as the templates etc is one big garbage dump.   This makes the long walk on the beach a sad and discusting experience.  Shame on you.
Dara-Khmer,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,"Well it's a nice view. But a little surprised at the rubbish on the high tide markI guess I shouldn't be given the infrastructure along the beach but given this is Bali, just thought it would be better"
MYK712,"Huddersfield, UK",May 2017,Lovely beach. Great waves. Watch the undercurrents though and take heed of what the lifeguards tell you. Sun lounger haggleto get 2 for 150k. Best Bakso in Bali is the guy with the street food cart just at the beach entrance. 
Anthony_Close,"Chicago, IL",May 2017,"John and Jevi run the best chairs and umbrella's on double six.  Just drive down until you get to the ""Seaside Mexican Restaurant"" it has a blue sign and is right after the circle K.  Enter the beach near there and ask where Gee Wiz Bar is.  They will point you towards the yellow and green umbrella's.  "
Ann C,"London, UK",May 2017,"This is a beautiful beach and when we visited there were few people around, but the local facilities are shabby.The showers to wash away the sand were all broken and very dirty. I didn't bother using the toilets because they were terrible.It's a shame because Bali is such a beautiful place with such lovely people, but this put me off going back to the beach."
iamrawat,"Pune, India",Feb 2017,I wasn't sure if I should go to the beach because of the reviews I read but since I decided to dine in an Indian restaurant in semniyak I paid a visit to the beach too.. Well the beach as many have mentioned is dirty and plagued with hawkers who keep disturbing you. But what makes up for it is the beautiful sunset. Visit in the evening to enjoy the sunset and dine if you wish to.
Marleyspiji91,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"Seminyak beach is the perfect spot for the sunset.It's just amazing! The beach is huge, you can enjoy the sunset from anywhere you'd like.Surfing lessons recommended, so cheap!"
Kimkortekaas,Bali,Apr 2017,"So Seminyak beach is a nice beach if you want to learn how to surf or just spend the day with a few bintangs, enjoy the sun and read a good book. It's not a beautiful beach, can get dirty especially during the raining season.The waves can get quite high so it dangerous to swim especially with small children. Sunsets however are amazing!"
Lisa W,10 contributions,Jan 2017,"Walked along this dirty, litter strewn beach to get to Potato Head and watch the sunset. Wouldn't want to go in and Potato Head is an overpriced tourist destination so prepare to pay. "
duhoz,"Beroun, Czech Republic",Apr 2017,"I found this beach as average and disappointing. Quite clean, without any shade to hide apart the overpriced umbrellas and deckchair for rent (IDR 250.000 per day).The sea is clean but great waves are good for surfers not for swimming. Also too low tide makes water shallow for swimming, jgood just to sit and let the water pass around you. You are also heavily bothered by hawkers. However the beach is nice for endless strolling around. But sunset is spectacular many tourist and locals gather here to watch it. If do not want to sit on the beach you can laze in the bar, sipping beer and admire the sunset."
Harrytol,"Sneek, The Netherlands",May 2017,Don't let your kids swim here! The waves and current is to strong! Almost always red flag so good warning at the beach. The beach restaurants are simpel but in good relax atmosfere... Ideal for wave surfers!
Brendan248,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,Walked along here from kuta and legian. Found legian beach to be the cleanest. Seminyak seemed to have a lot more rubbish washed up.....perhaps not cleaned as regularly??
Febry B,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2017,It's a great place to watch sunset and they have plenty of bar and restaurants to chill and have drinks. Music and live band performance make your evening feeling more romantic. 
Linda D,"Nelson Bay, New South Wales, Australia",May 2017,Just ok wouldn't recommend dirty but lots of eating places that are nice. Better beaches to visit in Bali
rosacu,"Attadale, Australia",May 2017,This a beach for walking and enjoying the fresh air. Large waves are noisy so not for swimming. Beach bars are good.
sals11274,"Nuneaton, UK",May 2017,"Not the greatest beach. Ugly brown sand and not good for swimming as the waves are huge. You also get harassed quite regularly by the beach sellers when you are trying to relax on your (rented) sun lounger. It is however quite a spectacular sunset point but we still only visited once, there are many better beaches in Bali."
Cassie T,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,"If you come from a pristine country like Australia, very few beaches elsewhere can compete and so it is the case in Bali; but Seminyak Beach was 7 minutes walk to our hotel and allowed us access along the whole stretch of Seminyak and Kerobokan beaches. It is faster to walk along beach front to say Potato Head Beach Club than to use the winding roads in Seminyak. We used it as our quick access to some other places like Petitenget Temple."
lindsaysmith3,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,I just love the beach here. It really doesn't matter what time of the day you go to the beach.  It truly is amazing & always buzzing with excitement.
Brad J,"Mandurah, Australia",May 2017,Visited Seminyak for the first time and was disappointed with the beach. The sand was grey and had a lot of rubbish washed up on the sand or was dropped there by selfish tourists. The locals do try to keep it clean but it is littered with rubbish. Casual dining along the beach at night with live music at most venues leads to a relaxed evening.
kydo40,"Mt Eliza, Australia",May 2017,Great for a long walk and people watching but a noisy spot to relax. We enjoyed walking along the beach early in the morning but avoided it late afternoon.
Sandy PH,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,The view during sunset is great. Explains all the beach bar in the area.The beach is much cleaner than Kuta beach and there are less people
Michelle B,"Noosa, Australia",May 2017,"Great beach to stroll along. Dark sand.  We didn't enter the water but saw lots of people swimming.  Looked like there were lots of rips. Vendors selling kites, sarongs, sunglasses and jewellery.  Hire a sunbed, buy a beer or learn to surf."
ExploreWithHappySi,Doha,May 2017,"spent one evening, but would love to come back..great place for shopping, sunset and just enjoy around."
Vanessa T,"Tauranga, New Zealand",May 2017,"ok, so maybe i am being harsh, but its just a beach, we have the Mount Beach here in NZ and some amazing beaches to be had.  this one was overtaken by heaps of Australians blobbed out, getting drinks, the water was not that clean and i would not have put my head under for anything."
RxVacation,"San Dimas, CA",May 2017,"We did not realized coming into Bali that the beach at Seminyak was really not swimmable and more for surfing, so we were kinda bummed on this, however, it does allow for endless hours of walks along the beach and the water in May was very comfortable and delightful. "
Janine W,8 contributions,May 2017,"Looks like a great surf beach, we walked a small way along it , was a rough day so no swimming allower"
Polley17,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",May 2017,"What can I say, there are a lot of great beaches over in Bali, however I didn't see anything special about this beach. It is still a nice beach to see and swim but there is a lot of other beaches that you can choose from. It smells at times from the water running off from the Seminyak itself.And be prepared to be bothered by the people selling stuff and coming up to you when you're relaxing.Overall, it is just a beach with no real special qualities but if you want to go to a beach and am close to this one then you will be able to swim and relax by it if you like. "
Sandra Derksen,"Eindhoven, The Netherlands",Apr 2017,"We made some nice strolls on the beach, visited few beachbars, where you can chill and watch sunset enjoying nice food and drinks. The beach is wide until you reach the sea. Sea is warm with high waves. Good for surfing and kiting."
chris g,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Hire a boogy board, or just relax on a sun lounge. for a quiet beach enter through Ku-De-Ta security gate."
obygold,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,Many places rent sun bed and umbrellas quite cheaply. The sand itself is generally of good quality and you can use the beach to either relax or seeing sunset. We loved this beach and it holds many fond memories for us
Fey N,79 contributions,Jun 2016,Clean and nice Long Beach walk to go best in morning and evening time.See the sunset in this ocean will be absolutely beautiful and must to try.
butchame,ararat,May 2017,"Great staff, lovely food but owner was on site and DID NOT Acnowledge Australian visitors. His agourance will make me stay elsewhere else but here "
B2wh,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,"First time to Seminyak Beach and feel disgusting with all the dirty and black sand beaches. Not good for swimming buy good for surfing. Thought can have a quiet sun tan at there, but everything there have to pay, we cant just lay our towel there, so no choice sit at one of the cafe and order drink..annoying was the beach vendors are everywhere. They keep asking you to buy something or massage. Quite disappointed with Bali. Anyway the sunset was very beautiful though.."
StantonJR,"Staines, UK",Apr 2017,"Standing and viewing the endless beach stretching before you is breathtakingly awesome.  The sea rolls in with large breakers, which are perfect for the surfers and again, watching them battle against the elements is a sight that never ceases to amaze.  However, walk along the beach and there is rubbish strewn about.  In some places the beach is discoloured and you can see why from the effluence in the water.  I did not venture in it and I certainly was amazed that others let their children anywhere these obviously polluted parts.  It was a great disappointment and made me wish that I had chosen anywhere else in Bali other than Seminyak/Kota.  They would do well to organise parties of people to clean the beach each day and then it might be a safer and more beautiful attraction.  "
William,"Beirut, Lebanon",Apr 2017,"Seminyak Beach has amazing sunset views, the sand is black and the sea is rough but the views are a wonderful pass for me"
Winterfamily4u,"Geelong, Australia",May 2017,Great sunset and bars on seminyak beach.You do get hassled but hey it's BaliJust luv the beach Bali atmosphere 
boshmickey,"Tupelo, MS",May 2017,"I visited Seminyak Beach with a friend following a wedding in Ubud. To put it short, it could be beautiful, but the trash makes it dirty and not a great location. I may be spoiled by the clean white sand of the Gulf of Mexico along with crystal clear water...this had neither. I'll try another beach on the next visit."
RhiannaWeston13,"Mandurah, Australia",May 2017,Went to go to la planche but was busy so went next door to Bali juice park. The sunset is amazing and so much to watch . Go around 5pm and enjoy the sights 
Jana P,"Bristol, UK",May 2017,To be honest I nearly cried when I went to Seminyak Beach. Very dirty around and you are not able to swim in the ocean as the waves are really high. First visit and my last visit. Definitely wouldn't recommend it.
579sharon,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Dec 2016,We unfortunately didn't spend much time on the beach as we were sight seeing but its a stunning beach with a lot happening for everyone
Vicki T,3 contributions,Apr 2017,Didn't like the beach at all.the sand was black and the surf was rough..i will stick to the swimming pools..
Gerard B,83 contributions,Oct 2016,We stayed at the W October & November 2016. Could not speak too highly of the place.We had a suite and it was sensational.The staff were ever helpful and friendlyGreat Value for money.
Devieapriliani,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2017,Enjoying evening walk in beach was a very pleasant things to do after working.Here you can try to eat meatballs or Roasted corn while enjoying the sunset. There are also some cafes and restaurants that offer different sensations to enjoy the atmosphere of the night on the beach.
benjiwave,"Geelong, Australia",Apr 2017,"Great for a paddle during the day, and a great place to enjoy a few beers and watch the sun set with the wife."
Toon34,"Greater Perth, Australia",May 2017,"Weather amazing most of the day and night, never had a breeze most of the day before so lovely and warm but low humidity great time of year to be in Bali. And not many yobbos so Allah good."
Amelia K,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",May 2017,Quite Crowded but not as dirty as Kuta or Legian. The sunset is just gorgeous. They have event called SOS - Sunset on Seminyak. 
djelc,"Chichester, UK",May 2017,"The beach itself isn't really that pretty as it has mostly black volcanic sand and alot of the gutter water from the island runs across the sand into the sea, which doesn't smell to clean. But through the day it's great for surfing and at sunset it comes alive with music. So good if that's what your after."
123susan456,"Lake City, FL",May 2017,After being in the phillipines and the islands in thailand i am very very dissapointed in the beach here.  Just an ordinary nothing special beach
gtahlia,"Washington DC, DC",May 2017,"The bars are rather more upmarket, beach was nice, but had a bunch of signs up for No swimming. I even got a chair and a massage on the beach there"
Wetwedgie,"London, UK",May 2017,"Spent our last night in Seminyak, before returning to London. Ventured to the beach before lunch, not a great experience.The beach, like Kuta Beach, is crazy and packed with people. Quite hard to relax or even take anything in with the consent - ""you want drink?, you buy?, massage?, you buy you buy?"" Avoid if you can"
MichaelWWest,"Kibworth Beauchamp, United Kingdom",May 2017,Big big beach but quite disappointed with quality of the sand & cleanliness.Very busy though for sunset which is stunning Maybe in the future it will improve 
Agnes S,2 contributions,May 2017,"clean, and lovely place to go. We had a great time with all friends and spending our time to catch sunset there."
Sunai W,"Mae Rim, Thailand",May 2017,A bit too crowded for me but nice sunset beach scene which a lot people will hang around with lots of club
Emma W,"Altea, Spain",May 2017,"Beautiful beach to stroll along, you can take more or less endless walks. There are plenty of places to stop for drinks or food. From what we saw, most of the beach is clean. There are however some patches with garbage and brownish water that doesn't look very healthy to swim in.We stayed in seminyak for five days in early May, not sure if the waves are always this high, but there were red flags more or less everywhere prohibiting from swimming. So if you fancy swims far out in the ocean or floating around in the water, this is not the right beach to go to"
AllyRogo,"Point Lonsdale, Australia",May 2017,"If surfing is your thing this beach is for you. The waves were huge! As for the rest of the beach, it is quite sad really. There wasn't a whole lot of rubbish but around the drainage areas it smelled of sewerage. Heaps of dogs around which was great for a dog lover. Not many strays either. We walked along early in the morning, around 8 so no hawkers. It was nice, but I think we are a bit spoilt in Australia with amazing white sandy beaches. "
Jamie M,2 contributions,May 2017,"Dirty black sand, lots of hawkers was also hard to find. Has Day beds available to utilise but only as a duo no more than two beds near each other "
KittyT,50 contributions,May 2017,"Such a lovely beach to relax and watch the sun go down. This beach is no where near as busy as Kuta and the vibe is more relaxed and laid back. Different bats have chairs and bean bags set up on the sand with umbrellas and small tables so you don't need to move. The sellers will come up to you with various wares (from sunglasses to fairy floss) but they're not as aggressive as in some other parts as you are sitting in the designated area of a restaurant. The only drawback is that the bathrooms are not pleasant to use - the public ones cost money and are not clean and many of the restaurant ones are not clean either - bring some tissues and hand sanitiser just in case. Lovely, relaxed evening watching the sun go down! "
Carly E,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,We went for a walk on the beach it's stunning at sunset! There is lots of sellers on the beach however just say no and keep walking unless you are interested lol
Guillaume T,"Ottawa, Canada",May 2017,The beach is great as clean. Lots of activity. Come with lots of street vendors but it is to be expected. A quick no and they leave you alone... nice sunset on the sitting bean bags... overall good place to go!!! 
Aminur R,4 contributions,Apr 2017,"Was our local beach during our stay in Bali and was only 25 minute walk through the busy, colourful and vibrant eat street and Seminyak square.Visited during the day and during sunset and there was a lot of beach to stroll down when we wanted to. The waves are wonderful to watch as the get bigger and more aggressive and sun loungers are easily available with young coconut and ice cream vendors regularly passing by.We got loungers for 1 hour at 25K Rupiah which seemed like a good price and added a young coconut to the day visit as well.The water and the sand is clean and the beach wasn't overcrowded at all. Sunset was set to be epic as you get a clear view of the horizon but alas on the evening we went the clouds decided to crowd around the sun as it set.I know other more secluded beaches provide more pristine waters and sands but Seminyak beach doesn't charge to access it which is always nice.Our only regret was not visiting the beach more often but our private villa did spoil us as well."
oliverc197,43 contributions,May 2017,"Not the nicest beach in Bali, but ok. Full of pricey flash beach clubs if that's your thing. Better to venture to the Bukit peninsula for nicer beaches and clearer water! Try balangan beach/ Sundays beach club/ uluwatu / Padang Padang..."
MykeAlpha,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2017,"Here is the infamous one and only Seminyak beach. Nice beach bars, cool crowd and lots of activities. The sea is always wavy so if you're not a surfer, you might not like it."
Gail H,22 contributions,May 2017,"Lovely location to watch the sunset. Great bars with bean bags, pretty umbrellas and great music! Visited Taris Bali for a lovely iced tea post massage. "
Elizabeth D,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Seminyak beach is quite beautiful and differs from Kuta in that is is cleaner and less crowded.  We walked down to Legian for our usual brunch and drink and enjoyed the peacefulness.  There are some great hotels that open up to the beach and generally you can go in to the cafes.  If in doubt, don't be put off by the security guard and ask them if you can go  in.  If you are approached by a hawker, simply say no thanks and keep walking, and they will not pursue you (as a rule). The beach at night is misty with the waves gently crashing on the beach, and I recommend you find a great restaurant that opens up to the beach for a beautiful evening of fine dining. If it is with someone you love, then all the better."
BTSS,"Carrum, Australia",May 2017,"Walking along the beach each day bought new & interesting delights! There's so much going on, you can't possibly see or experience it all in 1 day, & the nightlife along the beach is just fantastic & right up my alley!! "
Inukshukasia,Asia,May 2017,One of the most tranquil beaches in Bali great for sunset drinks.  Also if you are a beginner surfer this is the place to start 
Vazerol,"Lantsch/Lenz, Switzerland",Oct 2016,"Wonderful resort lined by a great beach, with numerous hotels, shops and restaurants. Gateway for tours around the island, for instance to Ubud."
michael t,"Perth, Australia",May 2017,"Spent the day at Seminyak beach ,it would no be a beach I would bring kids to ,tere is a lot of rubbish in the water and broken beer bottles in the sand not very safe for swimming either as tere was a strong rip beers was cheap $2.50 per bottle of Bintang "
Estelle P,"Seoul, South Korea",May 2017,"Beach is very beautiful, but the sands are too hot day time, so you have to put shoes! 😉and sunset is the best!!! 비치가 너무나 아름다워요! 단, 낮에는 모래사장이 너무나 뚜거우니 신발 꼭 신어야 해요^^ 선셋 역시 너무 예쁘니 꼭 방문하시길 ㅎㅎㅎ"
Madhumati I,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2017,It's a good beach to visit and enjoy the view. Accessible via bike or car. No parking fee. Clean and not much crowded. We went on Friday.
R G,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2017,"Not the sort of beach you would head to for a days swimming in the sheltered safe waters.I would imagine that if you wanted to paddle maybe (although the water didn't look that clean - brown colour) but appeared more to be for surfers with big waves.I'd imagine the sea is quite strong.If you want to walk along the beach the sea front is quite wide (compared to other beaches in Bali) so all ok.Good place to watch the sunset if you feel so inclined. Lots of places to sit, eat and drink also. Some venues also have live music."
jscyn,37 contributions,Jun 2016,"Seminyak beach is definitely not white sand which I prefer, but the beach itself is dirty and full of trash. There is really nothing special for me with this beach"
Kamariah1951,Australia,May 2017,"Courtyard Marriott Seminyak provides excellent service to their Private Beach. There are wifi, towels, water even ice blocks. Friendly staff as always. We cannot fault anything. Great service as always. "
summersky13,"Montreal, Canada",Apr 2017,The beach in Seminiak is not everywhere recommended for bathing. While visiting and walking along the beach I realized that in some places where the water is really dirty and I am not so sure that is not coming from sewages. Plus the huge waves are the delight of surfers not swimmers. If you visit with a small child make sure it stays far from the water due to waves and fast curents
SunnytheTraveller,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2017,Best sunset beach by far when it's low tide. High tide is dramatic but the surf is for experts only. 
FabioOliveira86,"Lucerne, Switzerland",May 2017,Dark sand dirty beach ! ( water is very dirty ) orherwise is great ! Nice bars ( day and night)at the beach with live bands performing !
Nomadman411978,"London, UK",May 2017,Seminyak Beach is a good beach without being spectacular. However the sunsets make up for that and during the day the sand is good enough but the sea can be rough.
davemickle2015,Walsall UK,May 2017,Nice beach but a little unclean and not white sand.  There is a terrific incoming waves at all times and it is not suitable for just normal bathing
Tim D,"Geraldton, Australia",May 2017,"Not as crowded as Kuta but offering all the same, food was great night shows even better, live gigs up and down the beach, grab a bean bag sit back and enjoy"
David C,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,The sand is beautiful and soft and when the tide is out there is vast amounts of sand.  Was different than our golden sand on the Gold Coast with black sand mixed in.  The sun sets into the ocean and is magical. 
Dale H,"Darwin, Australia",May 2017,"Not a lot of sand to relax on, dumping waves. At least you dont get overly hassled to buy stuff.Better beaches around to enjoy, or enjoy a hotel pool."
Maddie,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Most breathtaking, warming, magical sunset I've ever seen ! Walked all the way along the beach, lots of little warungs and places to stop and take on the view. Enjoy ! "
Novia K,91 contributions,Jul 2016,"The decent place to kill the time by lazying at the beach bench until sunset, enjoying local foods, beers."
Charlène L,"Menton, France",May 2017,Full of tourist people who just want to spend money and are superficial. The beach isn't beautiful. Women's who comes every 30 minutes trying to sell jellery or other stuff. If you are looking for tranquility it's definitely not the right place ! 
cdjenks,Bft,Apr 2017,Nice beach with good views and plenty of clubs and cafes available as you walk along.There are hawkers but buying a few wish lanterns from one and set them off was a lovely experience !
ahmedelbialy,Egypt,Sep 2016,You can do any water activities in this place except swimming as It will be very difficult because of very high waves 
Appu S,"Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India",Mar 2017,"Compared to the beaches in Uluwatu, seminyak is not that great but it still is a good enough place to go in case you have nothing to do."
t0ngdee,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,The waves at the beach was great! Very gd for surfing... sand was fine and the crowd was gd as well. Recommended to at least take a walk down the beaches
thespellofrepetition,54 contributions,Apr 2017,Great beach to wander down to check out the beach front hotel bars and watch the sunset. Great place to catch some waves when the surfs up. Bit rough for swimming however.
nurseladyAtlanta,Atlanta,Apr 2017,"Soft brown sand, big waves, mostly clear water. Current is too strong for many swimmers, experienced surfers will be happy. Can be crowded in areas near public parks and access points, and will get visibly dirtier in these same areas with trash littering the sand and surf in some places and the occasional smell of sewage. Overall a good beach to visit, choose areas near nicer resorts for best experience."
990harshadb,138 contributions,Apr 2017,Reached here at dark so just got an ok view of the beach but enjoyed the dinner at the shack wit nice breeze and gud music also good food had fun wished had come in daylight.
adizazuli,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2016,Seminyak beach is which one beach in Bali. Perfect to see sunset and surfing too. And many beach bar surrounding.
Manikarn M,"Mannheim, Germany",Apr 2017,"We have been to Seminayak beach during our stay in Seminayak,Bali. Beach is clean from perspective of Solid dirt like Polythene etc. Sea water has much higher current than Kuta Beach. Number of people can be seen there doing surf.Best Thing: Branded eating outlets on beach like potato head, less crowded, good for walk.Beautiful pic background and scenes for sunset. Near to Tanha lot temple.Bad Thing: Sewer water for Seminayak drops in to sea so little messy in between. Overall worth spending time!!"
Putu Eka W,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2016,It is the cleanest beach in kuta. Walk to the south you will find many famous restaurant with colorful umbrella and bean bag
TavaresJorge,"Macau, China",Apr 2017,Went there a few times the beach is very big but the sea is a bit hard to swim. If you  like to swim or just chill in the water not the best beach for you. Care with the high prices for the sunbeds and the umbrellas. 
jenny c,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Currently staying at Seminyak and the beach is lovely. Yes perhaps the sand is not as perfect as our sydney sand but the view from my hotel room is spectacular and when travelling I am looking for something different from home. I have walked along the beach before in January and there was a lot of rubbish on the beach. I read this is season dependent and in the dry season you don't see the rubbish.This appears to be true. The beach is lovely and wide and easy to have a significant walk along to other beaches. Seminyak itself is a busy place. Seems to get busier with each visit. It's easier than what it use to be to walk along the streets but still would be difficult for someone who struggled with mobility. A zillion great restaurants here to choose from. All up a great place to stay
Pankti Shah,"Vadodara, India",Jan 2017,"The posh area of beaches, Seminyak Beach is home to features that every modern day man desires in a beach. It is house to world class chef’s food. There is also many shopping options for clothing and fashion."
ritapetita,glasgow,Apr 2017,Amazing..loved it..lots of fab places to eat and shopping is good. Somd beautiful hotels especially on beachfront
Nelwin C,1 contribution,Apr 2017,"My first visit to bali and had no inclination of sightseeing or touring there.  Found great reviews of The Cheapest Travel in Bali. my questions were quickly answered and i booked an full day tour with them.  Our driver promptly arrived at our hotel and we started our tour. Dewa our driver was very courteous and answered all our question about the tour and even the history of Bali. His politeness, knowledge were on track and very helpful.  He accompanied us on our tour and made sure we were comfortable as we entered the chosen places to visit. Dewa's caring and assistance made our tour a wonderful experience. I will definitely use this company again and hopefully have our driver Dewa again. i will highly recommend this company to all my friend and family visiting Bali.  Thank you Anantha and Dewa for your exemplanary"
Diennick,29 contributions,Apr 2017,Good beach to watch the sunset and play games. Very wide and large but also very busy. There are many bars/restaurants that have beds or sitbags for the day.
Menehune808,"Hilo, HI",Apr 2017,The beaches are long and sandy.  Large breaks to shore and easy to wade but not swimming for beginners.  Body surfer would love these shorebreaks and surfers the outside breaks.
Vanessa P,"Surbiton, UK",Apr 2017,I didn't like Semiyak beach at all. Went there once. In fact Semiyak was not what I was expecting. It's really busy with lots of traffic taxi drivers constantly hooting. I just didn't feel relaxed. It felt like we where in a hot noisy city full of designer shops and to find a nice beach you had to go to a beach club with a minimum spend. We left after a few days even though we had a hotel. We also had a lot of trouble getting cash out. Make sure when using cash machine you press checking account as it has 3 options and you press the wrong one and you don't get any money. A lot of the machines kept running out of money. Everyone from all over the world had trouble getting cash. Always get a blue bird taxi as they have to use the meter and they are much cheaper. You can download the app before you come called my bluebird taxi. I went all over Bali and I found the people very friendly everywhere. And if you learn thank you and a bit of Balinese they love it. Oh if you like wine ( like me) bring it from duty free as it's expensive everywhere in Bali. Semiyak is not the place for cheap shopping either. It's all expensive cloths shops and we found prices cheaper in Kuta. 
yosef_santoso,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"Nice beach,not crowded as kuta beach and this beach more clean than kuta,many foreigner here especially western"
Sk8nsnogrl,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2017,Seminyak beach was a black sand beach with rough waves and not too clean. I totally would recommend a different beach if you want to see crystal clear water and beautiful sand. 
John M,3 contributions,Apr 2017,"Does the job but beach loungers are abit pricey. Would visit again but it's not a calm beach so be aware, maybe not so suitable for younger kids"
Anita A,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2017,"Only walked this beach, didn't swim and it was lovely, lots of resturaunts along the way that are amazing "
Theoda F,"Toledo, OH",Apr 2017,This beach would be very ideal if it qasnt for being asked 30 times to buy some souvenirs from the beach roamers..
gsraju2k,"Visakhapatnam, India",Apr 2017,"Visited this beach on 19 th April with my wife and son. Although it's a sunny day we felt comfortable with cool breeze from the sea. As we relaxed in one of the beautifully arranged big umbrellas for shade,our son enjoyed the surfing. Nice place to spend leasurly."
blnotman,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"So much rubbish washing ashore, could not bring myself or our group to go swimming- such a shame sunset was beautiful. "
Liège M,"Espinho, Portugal",Apr 2017,Beautiful but with pollution of cloacal waste  whats makes it not healthy for bath..I don't want to come back 
Mark O,"Kirkby-in-Ashfield, UK",Apr 2017,"This is for anyone visiting,  or thinking of visiting Seminyak this year (2017).These are only our own opinions based on our recent holiday there. GETTING THERE: Most people will arrive via Denpasar Airport, and from the arrivals hall you'll enter a very busy area with hordes of people holding name boards,  and even more taxi drivers vying for your business.  My advice here is to ensure that you've pre-booked a taxi through your hotel. Your (c30 min) journey to your Seminyak hotel will then be easier and probably less expensive.  Our pre-booked taxi cost £15.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok, Denpasar and environs is never going to win any beauty awards, if you're familiar with the Far East then the ramshackle set-up, the huge volume of crazily driven scooters, and the antithesis to Western order won't come as a shock, but if Bali is your first time east of the Mediterranean then be patient and stick with it.  Seminyak has been designed for enjoyment whilst Denpasar is a capital city with few reasons to linger.Seminyak is quite compact and this review only encompasses this area and not Kuta. The vast majority of the accommodation in town is either beach facing,  or a short walk from the beach.HOTELS: Whilst we can only comment specifically on one, the excellent Taum Resort, we saw enough of the others during our stay to build a very favourable opinion on standards,  most were 4* and quite a few the vaunted 5* quality, and they looked every inch comparable with the best beach hotels in Europe. We saw a number of very smart beachfront hotels with sun decks, pools and lovingly manicured gardens, where the almost daily stunning sunsets could be enjoyed in blissful surroundings. NIGHTLIFE : This is where Seminyak scores highly.  It's set-up for people who like to enjoy life once the sun goes down - but that said,  it's not trying to be an Ibiza. We felt that the beating heart of Seminyak was given over to couples,  irrespective of age (we're 40's and 50's), and testimony to this were the range of other couples that we met during our stay; the vast majority being Australian  (3 hrs flight from Perth for example ). Lots of 'gap year' youngsters and 'Eat, Pray, Love' wannabe types looking for adventure or love (or both). They'd all gravitated to the right place, heaps of great bars and restaurants and enough high-end nightspots to please every taste,  budget and preference,  most people will have heard of Potato Head and Ku De Ta etc, they're very good as you'd expect, but look beyond them and the supporting cast will enthrall you and your money will go a long way. Although just examples and exchange rates will fluctuate, you'll find most bars trying to lure you in with 2-1 cocktails or 2-1 Happy Hour deals for around (UK) £1.50 for the beer (Bintang is the excellent local beer) and £3 for the cocktails,  compare this to London prices and you'll be in the slightly unusual position of feeling mildly wealthy.  Eating out bears similar fruit and we enjoyed some brilliant food in extremely atmospheric restaurants for Wetherspoons type prices! For a couple of personal recommendations try La Laguna, Ginger Moon, Batik, Grocer & Grind,  but there are nany more as good.  In short then, tons of choice,  fantastic service wherever you go,  and very kind on your pocket  (have you booked yet?).SAFETY: This one comes in two parts.  If you're reading this and you're an adult,  or going with other adults,  then this will be the safest place you've ever been unless you drink too much,  if you get drunk then at some point you're likely to fall foul of the 2-wheeled 24/7 carnage that is the half a billion scooters that compete for space on the narrow Seminyak streets, these things are literally everywhere and at times the lunatic drivers (term used loosely ) will mount the kerb and use the footpath. Many of the scooters appear to be carrying at least 3 generations of the same family and they'll all have aboard items such as ladders, power saws, live animals and the sort of stuff we'd need a Qashqai to transport. We took photos of the aforementioned just because we figured the folks back home wouldn't believe us! Crossing the road in Bali would be classed as a dangerous sport in the Uk, but help is normally on hand courtesy of the ubiquitous security guards, who guard everything.  They all carry illuminated batons and make full use of the whistles that they also carry, if they spot that you're struggling to cross the road then they're out there in a jiffy to see you safely across.  Top boys.The pavements are hilarious in that one minute they're there,  and then the next minute they've either ended abruptly at a large chasm,  or a  set of neck height power lines (not kidding) ,  or....the pavement just reappears on the opposite side of the street. So, given the last point,  I'd implore any parents with babies,  toddlers,  or pre-teen children to take a holiday elsewhere,  because we saw so many anguished parents frantically trying to either control their kids next to the Nurbergring town roads,  or trying to stop enough of the wacky races participants in order to get to the other side,  hugely dangerous and quite disturbing to see. Bali is lovely but small children brought up with UK road sense are in peril here.Like I said earlier, sensible adults will have no issues here. BEACH : This was a shock to us. When we booked our holiday we of course Googled Bali (Seminyak) beach images,  and feasted our eyes on the stunning shots. In reality there are times when the long Seminyak Beach is quite the opposite. In the wet season it rains regularly and when it does the stuff cones down in torrents,  add to this the generally observed habit of throwing most litter into the gutter,  then you'll quickly realise that all of the litter is quickly washed into surface water culverts that themselves wash into the small rivers that flow through the town. These then run straight into the sea,  and the tide deposits the whole lot on the tide line early doors the next morning! ! Take a beach stroll on the morning after one of the regular evening thunderstorms and you'll see what I mean.; absolutely shocking mess and not safe for walking on as you can imagine.  The Balinese seem to employ a small army of people (many wearing face masks and PPE) plus tractors to try and make good this mess every day.  When this has been done then large swathes of the beach do justice to the brochure images,  but just be aware that at times the beach can be quite awful and there has to be some effort made to try and improve the littering situation which I have to say is more down to the locals,  than the visitors!TAXIS: Worthy of its own section,  the town is chock full of taxis and this whirring convoy just seems to endlessly circulate around the centre (AKA Seminyak Square) looking for anyone 'walking '. We deduced that when Balinese taxi drivers take their training course their first instruction is the assumption that someone walking is in dire need of a fare-paying lift! From the second you creep beyond the wall of your hotel EVERY taxi driver will hit his horn and slow down,  many will stop and wind down their window and wait for you to agree that 'yes....you can't possibly walk 100 metres to the beach / bar / shop, and that you need a lift'.  The trick is to either smile and carry on walking, or just ignore them. Both methods work equally well but the good news is that these guys aren't the least bit pushy or aggressive. You get used to the patter and we assume that they get used to just driving around all day.That said, be advised of the ongoing scams. The ONLY officially licensed taxis are Blue Bird. That doesn't help you with recognition because in Bali EVERY taxi is blue and the same model  (Toyota ) as the official ones!  Also many of the unlicensed taxis have the name 'Blue XXXX' that look almost identical to the pucker version. The difference being that if you ride in a dodgy taxi then the driver will either say ""meter not working"", or when you arrive at your destination,  he will say ""no change"". The latter is a patent lie of course, and if you enter a taxi with ""broken meter "" then get straight out. We of course fell fowl of both on day one, but a very helpful 'official ' Blue Bird driver apprised us of the dark side of Seminyak taxis on day two,  citing that unlicensed drivers face fines if caught with dodgy meters or if they're discourteous to customers.  In summary we found the whole taxi topic amusing,  and I'd also add that almost every driver  stopped or slowed down if they saw that we wanted to cross the street.In terms of fares. From our hotel to either the beach or Seminyak Square,  both a 30 min walk,  we'd pay the minimum evening fare of IDR 30.OOO. Which worked out at £2 at the March exchange rate of IDR 16000 to £1. MONEY: I've alluded to the generally very agreeable cost of eating and drinking out, taxis I've also said are cheap,  and with a total absence of other means of public transport you might want to engage your hotel in finding a locally recommended driver. We hired a friendly driver who took us all around the island for £30 per day, try doing that in the UK and you'll be adding another '0', fantastic value and all of the drivers speak good English  (as do almost all Balinese ).There are numerous ATM's dotted around Seminyak and my wife and I used different ATM's with our respective banks and the exchange rates worked out at broadly the same as the exchange rates that we'd been given prior to setting off from the UK. If you're a single female traveller and are conscious of security with your cards / money then there are a couple of cash machines inside the new shopping mall in Seminyak Square, the latter housing some good shops,  but tons of better ones that aren't generic 'high street' around the town that are well worth a look.  THE PEOPLE : If you've been to Thailand then you'll be sitting there thinking that 'nobody is friendlier than the Thai's', I know you're thinking that because we thought so, too. But come here and you'll be truly in the presence of the nicest people on God's green Earth. We were humbled by their humility,  their values,  their sheer desire to make a difference to your day. The service we received in every single venue, bar, hotel, or even total strangers in the street was so genuine,  so wonderful,  that to not come back to Bali would be a crime. Come and see for yourself,  if you've been promising yourself  / husband / wife / partner to take a trip to Bali then go to your bank tomorrow,  or beg a wealthy relative for funds,  sell that useless artefact or trade-in the boat you never used,  and drag your weary body to this temple of soul salvation, I promise you that you will enjoy every moment and you'll return to our embittered crime -ridden soulless country a better person.SEMINYAK: Yes it's a fabulous destination.  It's not without its faults and I'd advocate it's not fit for young children or the infirm,  but if your mojo has lost its sparkle then this is the place to lift your spirits. Great hotels, great nightlife, and incredible people. WEATHER: There are two main seasons in Bali. Hot and wet and hot and dry. We came end of March which is towards the end of the wet season. We had rain almost every day but in the main the rain and thunderstorms came late afternoon or during the night. When it rains it comes down in torrents but the temperature doesn't drop,  meaning it gets very humid. When the sun comes out it's blistering hot and most days the mercury will climb up to 32c (90f in old money ) and often beyond. The actual temperature feels hotter so the 'real feel' in the daytime is more like 40c (104f). Bear that in mind if you're fair skinned!  At night the thermometer rarely dips below 25c (77f) so you'll not need to bring outer layers here save for a rain mac. What disappointed me was the appalling lack of weather forecast detail available online in the lead up to our holiday.  The BBC didn't feature a single location on Bali,  others just gave a  generic 'cut and paste ' tropics forecast, and the go-to Wunderground  (Weather Underground ) gave pessimistic forecasts which simply stated ""cloud,  frequent thunderstorms "" for most of the days we were there,  and whilst 'yes' we did get some cloud and some storms,  the latter's forecasts made no mention of the 5-6 hours of blazing sunshine that we got each day. Only one day out of 12 was 'bang on' their prediction. So I'm saying don't take too much notice of the forecasts before you come out here,  they're not accurate enough!  Have a great time.  "
Andy M,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"Seminyak is just full of high end shops and bars and very expensive beach clubs and hotels.The beach is very average the water doesn't not clean, you only have to look in the little creeks to feed onto the beach to see the quality of the water , most people just use the swimming poolsThe one very annoying thing is the people that drive around in early hours of the morning on loud motorbikes disturbing everybody that's trying to sleep."
Norma S,3 contributions,Apr 2017,"a place to relax and drink, you can also have live band and the best part you can have the best color of sunset and you don't need to go too far. i never get bored of this place"
nik_getmygrubon,"Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany",Apr 2017,"Seminyak beach is awesome, it has miles and miles of lovely day beach, great swells fit beginners and advanced surfers alike, a great line of nice beach clubs but unfortunately no trees whatsoever so throw you some shade. That's really complaining on a high level here but lunch hours are just so super hot. Gotta stop, am off to the beach. ☺️"
cindydk321,"Lafayette, CA",Apr 2017,"Perfect place to take a walk before it gets too hot out.  The water was so warm, the stray dogs were chilling and playing together, and the beach stretches out for miles.  I got a good walk in.  Perfect."
Greybeard111,"Ely, UK",Feb 2017,"Took a walk to see Seminyak beach, as apparently its a place to experience. From what I saw the beach was dirty, with the evidence of the previous nights' beach parties. Why can't people take their rubbish away after they had their fun. Beach hawkers were an annoying problem as well. I appreciate these people need to make a living, but would not accept my saying no to them. I'm am sure they were not Balinese. My only high light of this visit was to see a coconut being washed up on to the shoreline. If you want to experience a beach that is not cared for, then go to Seminyak Beach."
KDPop,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"I will keep this short. Most of the beaches in this region of Bali are in a complete mess. Filthy, grimy and in need of some major attention. The issue remains the ammount of businesses, hawkers, stray dogs and litter in the ocean. This on top of climate just repels you from the potential beauty that could have once been seen here in the late 70s / early 80s. "
Baxy,brisbane,Apr 2017,Dirty beach.. not worth the traveling experience. It seems to be actually cleaner down in Legian and Kuta.. Rubish all through the sand..
Peter L,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2017,Not the cleanest beach around..............lots of plastic washed up every morning. Would not recommend swimming here
MarkSalPortugal,"Hertford, UK",Apr 2017,"Parts of the beach are dirty, not clean, littered and there are lots of dogs and some dog mess. We expected the beaches and cost line to be stunning and I am sure some are, however this is not quite one of those beaches. Disappointing! "
Oktay S,"Heidelberg, Germany",Apr 2017,"The beach is nice but it is polluted. It is not the best place to swim. The waves are very strong. There are some parts where sea pulls you into the ocean. Please be careful and don't go far from beach. When you try to rest in the beach, many sellers try to sell things and never let you alone. "
Phil R,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2017,This is a great beach to walk along and enjoy the views. It is very relaxing if you are near the Seminyak area as some parts can be overcrowded. Great place for sunset or to have a drink or meal at one of the many hotels and bars.
Juanita M,7 contributions,Apr 2017,An amazing atmosphere.  Warm water and fun place to chill and have a few drinks with the sun going down.
Michael_Teoh,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"Seminyak beach are the clean and beautiful view beach,there also is a good place for surfing. Nearby have a lot great restaurant."
Marcus W,"Stockholm, Sweden",Apr 2017,"This beach is really nice to look at. Unfortunately the tide works the wrong way here as the waves become stronger as the day passes. Get a beachclub with a pool and enjoy. But sitting on this beach is not an alternative.... there are better places to sit in the sand. After 16:00 you have the best sun set in the world.... so.... take it for what it is, not how it sounds."
Dougy_Lyell,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,They try hard to keep it clean : ) .. it's a happening place for surfers and yoga instruction or mostly good walks for visitors and locals ! 
Brylie H,17 contributions,Apr 2017,Rubbish everywhere and dirty water. I wouldn't swim in it. Better beaches definitely ! Otherwise Seminyak is great
Leanne N,Bass hill,Apr 2017,"The Karma beach was beautiful, we paid AUD $50.00 for the $20.00 entrance fee & AUD $30.00 towards meals. "
bondbaby007,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Kuta beach is cleaner, by that I mean the sand is whiter and the water is clear. Or try Padang Padang, although small stretch of sand which gets really crowded.Semniyak beach is good for a stroll, watching the sunset and to admire all the luxury hotels, but go elsewhere to swim."
rachelywheeler,"Redland City, Australia",Mar 2017,"after paying $5 for a banana chair on the beach I felt like  breadcrumb thrown amongst hungry seagulls..There was no rest for hagglers.. smelt of waste products and ocean was polluted with plastic , so sad"
BlessedAloy,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,"Visit the beach just before sunset which provides great photo opportunities.  Do not bother going there for sunbathing, you will likely have to pay for your deck chair rental and also approach by the local vendors selling their products. Just visit the beach for a good photo shoot will do. You can enter the beach via the side entrance near Kudeta. "
Elli,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Amazing beach and the sea is amazing the waves are dangerous but also fun and swimmable . The evening are really good with bean bags with live bands watching the sunset. 
KATY P,"Kincumber, Australia",Feb 2017,"Seminyak beach is quite long.  It can get quite rough and it's not the most beautiful beach in Bali however it has some fantastic hotels and eateries and it's a great walk!  If you need a driver in Bali to take you there,  I can recommend Putu at fair dinkum transport and tours.  He's on tripadvisor too and took us all around seminyak"
DT8888,Singapore,Apr 2017,Great beachfront. Beach and water very clean. Sun beds from local vendors are ridiculously expensive and if you need one better go to one of the beach clubs where you get top service and a pool as well. The surf is amazing but equally dangerous. Do listen to the Lifeguards they know better than you do where it's safe to swim. In some places the current is scarily strong and can just pull you out to sea.
Lorraine C,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2017,I'm sure if you can see past the rubbish & smell in this beach it would be nice but that's a big if!!!The amount of rubbish was disgusting which def did not encourage us to stay!Avoid at all cost there are way too many nice beaches to waste time with this one 
CaseyTeh,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,Good location to busk in the beach atmosphere and watch the sunset.Great to see many locals with theirs dogs roaming along the beach together with all the tourists holidaying on this island.The sunset view was definitely worth making a trip there to enjoy it and some photo taking.
Chloe G,29 contributions,Feb 2017,"One of my favourite things about Bali is the service that you can get on the beach. I am not a beach lover usually get you can sit on the beach and order meals and drinks and not have to sit on the sand and it's awesome. You've gotta be firm with locals that are selling stuff on the beach if you're not interested in buying because if you look interested they will show you literally everything you have to offer and it can be hard to get across that you aren't interested once you have started looking which can be awkward. The sand is clean and soft, the water isn't full of rubbish but you do get the occasional piece. The waves can get pretty rough, I'm a pretty confident swimmer but some of the waves got me pretty good! Overall it's a nice place to spend your time relaxing."
Elsa N,7 contributions,Apr 2017,"Love the seminyak beach, people around here very nice, we really enjoyed and not disturbing with people offering things. And the wave its very cool for played board. We spend all day relaxing on the beach. "
Sharon L,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Love drinks on the beach at sunset in one of the many ""bars"" set up along the beach. Amazing sunsets, cool breezes & great prices. "
Lyndell P P,"Quakers Hill, Australia",Apr 2017,"Great spot, chairs & umbrellas to hire, as well as surfboards & boogie boards. Clean water, service on the beach for drinks & some but not too many hawkers"
Adi Saputro,"Salatiga, Indonesia",Apr 2017,Walk over night on this beach so peaceful l. We can enjoy the wave and wind come from the see. Really good beach for relax time !
Celine P,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2017,"It is a walking distance from the villa I stayed.  Clean, soft sands, long coast that you can enjoy walking along with sunshine.  The waves is unpredictable.  In one day it was great tides and 2 days later it got a red flag up.  Luckily I was guided by a local security, he strongly advised me that never go to the water when red flag up.  Though I saw a number of tourists and surfers ignore the flag's warning.Hope you luck to have a good and save wave to enjoy ;)"
thredbear56,"Bowral, Australia",Apr 2017,"Wouldn't swim in the ocean personally, not the cleanest of water. However if it's sunset your after then the bean bag restaurants offer a great view and some cheap eats."
Jonathand24,"Mobberley, Cheshire",Apr 2017,"And you get all sorts of life on Seminyak Beach. It all depends on what you want from a beach as to whether or not it is a good place to go.The problem here is that for every good point, there is an opposite and vice versa. Firstly this is a huge beach. At low tide very wide and it is accessed by a few gaps in the rows of restaurants, cafes and bars which line the coast usually abutting the access roads . You will pay to park, even a motorbike nearby but then it will be relatively safe. The alternative is that you will get free parking in an isolated area and have you bike pinched or complain that there are no facilities.This is an excellent beach for running especially by the water and if you go fast enough you wont be bothered by hawkers. However if you stay still for five minutes they will be all over you. Especially if you show any interest in the sunglasses, watch or Ken Holm wok that they are selling. This is truly an international problem now but they have to earn a living and they generally move on if politely addressed. The problem is that there are so many of them there is always another one to follow. Alternatively, you may just want your hair braiding, sir, or your nails varnishing whilst sitting on a beach. To be honest, you can get pretty much anything you want on Seminyak Beach except probably any peace.The water is warm but a lot of sand suspension as it is shallow. It can also be windy and because of its undisturbed length,windy and disorientating. Look out for the flags for safe swimming. A truly high point is to watch the sunset especially with a cold beer at one of the bars or walking along the sand with your partner. If my memory serves me correctly though. If you have the right partner it doesn't matter where you are.Whilst you are there you may as well go to see it."
Maysworld,"Brooklyn, NY",Apr 2017,The beach is beautiful and very powerfyl. If you're a surfer then you are in the right country. The waves are big and strong. 
George E,Dewsbury,Apr 2017,"I suppose we were naive in assuming all beaches on Bali would be like a scene from South Pacific.Seminyak beach has rather dark sand, suffers from some rubbish and a constant tide, not of sea but of touts trying to sell stuff doggedly but unenthusiastically.Umbrellas and sunbeds cost about £7 each but are more comfortable than trying to lay on a towel in a high wind.The sea has a lot of suspended sand as the shoreline is very shallow.Its always good to be by the sea, however, even when its impossible to find peace.One of the tourists on the sunbed next to me (which the attendant had already sold to three others before her) was having a massage from two locals plus another one trying to sell her a hat at the same time!If you are in Seminyak and like a beach there isn't much choice but you might be a little disapointed"
Janine1926,"Geelong, Australia",Apr 2017,You can rent a sun lounge and spend day lying by the beach. Many vendors try to sell you their wares but they don't hassle you if you tell them to leave. Many great venues line the shores so you can easily get a drink in the hot sun. Don't forget to always swim between the flags. Sometimes the waves can be dumpers. Overall a nice experience which would be recommended
Mehndi Art b,9 contributions,Apr 2017,"It's an amazing beach to go for a run/ walk. We tried little workouts here too. I practiced yoga independently.Watching the sunset as we walked was bliss.Very popular for surfers because of the huge waves!There's options to hire sun beds/ bean bags to watch the sunset. Loads of bars and places to eat along the beachside. Negative factors are;1. There's a lot of washed up rubbish on the sand so watch where you step! Especially broken glass pieces on some parts.2. You have to pay to park and visit the beach. I only put this as a negative factor as it was free in Phuket Thailand! (I know I shouldn't compare but costs can build up if you're visiting daily!)3. For me, crabs! That's because they freak me out! 4. People trying to sell you stuff - a generic issue worldwide whilst travelling!"
toowelltravelled64,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"The sunset of course is legendary, but the place comes to life at night. With many beach chairs, bean lounges and music for all tastes. Nice way to spend an evening."
rohit1911,Mumbai,Mar 2017,"A must visit beach for everyone coming to Bali. It's peaceful and the night life is also good here. Enjoy a romantic stroll or just sip a beer while sitting on the bean bags, this beach will surely give you some good memories."
Rene & Bailey,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2017,It is a nice beach.The boys had some surf lessons and they did enjoy the time and the waterIt's not the last time we will go there if we are in the area.
JVNMelbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Visited 13 April 2017 for surf lesson. Firstly the beach. Grey Black sand with trash and overflowing bins. Tons of beach traders selling fake goods and hair braiding. Did not see a toilet anywhere.Sad to see stray dogs on the beach as well many of which are pregnant or have recently given birth.The water looked nice from afar but once in, was filthy and full if trash and used shopping bags and plastic.A real pity as there is huge potential. There must be better options than this.Will not return. Not recommended."
Shaheen H,54 contributions,Apr 2017,"It's a lovely beach but not white sand, you can sit at one of the food place and enjoy the view or even go for a swim and use the shower facility. So no need to pay for a sunbed on the beach. I saw some reviews saying it was full of rubbish, we didn't see any so maybe we went when it was just cleaned...."
LarryandTim,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Mar 2017,"This is a fabulous beach - wide, sandy, with moderate surf.  Very clean with a few places to eat along the beach."
humdinger,"Dublin, Ireland",Apr 2017,Disappointing beaches in seminyak. Was definitely expecting more. Not white sandy and smooth! Be prepared to see A LOT of rubbish and dirt. Such a pity to see what could be beautiful totally abused and kinda smelly. Great sunsets and waves though! 
Neco D,44 contributions,Apr 2017,Thus Beach is only 15 minutes hike from my hotel here in Seminyak. Good for sun bathing and surfing.
743kcnguyen72,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2017,"If you are a surf lover, this is it...best and biggest wave you ever seen. Very nice long stretch beach for walking. A bit dirty with trash flow on top from where am at though."
Peter_ACT_OK,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,This beach is depressing - grey sand and brown water on the day we were there but the worst thing was the litter.  I have never seen such a filthy beach.  Would not dare to walk barefoot here!
Shirley C,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2017,"This is something worth seeing during the evening, there is a beautiful sunset, hawkers, although they an be a pain when you are trying to eat evening dinner.Great ambience, on the beach watching the sunset, watching the world go buy sitting on the seating with a cold BINTANGThe beach comes alive, with the locals their dogs... kids and it's much cooler"
MayaMamaDav,"Depok, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"One of beautiful beaches in bali, near with the famous resto with colorfull umbrella named la plancha. Parents and their children will enjoy playing on the beach together"
k and m munro,"Kirkby Mallory, UK",Apr 2017,"Wouldn't swim or put my towel on that beach. It's grim! However, walk to your left and you'll come across some nice looking beds and the sea looks nicer. Try pedang pedang beach instead for a real taste of Bali "
Maritraveler,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,Not a very clean beach which is unfortunate. Walking on the sand is also full of rubbish and glass so be mindfull.
Viktor P,7 contributions,Mar 2017,Nice beach for surfing not for swiming. Lot of beach bars and with beach restaurant on the night. Good for long beach walk.
103thelighthouse,"Townsville, Australia",Apr 2017,Having said that the drainage system ruins a northerly walkRelax on the beach on day beds or sip a drink in one of the many bars whilst the kids enjoy the clean beach
Don B,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,"At high tide it ceases to exist, and at low tide you wade through garbage. Would not plan on going there ever."
Oscar S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,A beautiful landscape of beach for public to enjoy... there are several beach club along the beach that will ensure you to enjoy your moment and relaxation
David S,142 contributions,Apr 2017,"In a hot and humid Bali, too find Seminyak beach was a life saver. Cool wind and warm seas greeted us and we stayed and drank beers and wine till the sun went down. This is not one of the most prettiest beaches we've seen but to provide some relief with that cool breeze was priceless."
Penny D,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,Awesome place to hang out. Nice views good atmosphere enjoyed the beanbags rather than tables and chairs 
Neda E,2 contributions,Mar 2017,This beach was beautiful and jam packed with restaurants and activities.The Unfortunate Issue was Rubbish every where
Emily H,7 contributions,Jan 2017,This beach was beautiful and jam packed with resturants and activities but there was ALOT of rubbish scattered around the beach which was sad to see. The water was very dirty but it had lovely views. A once in a lifetime view.
Andrina M,10 contributions,Mar 2017,"There's a sign before the beach letting us know it's ""garbage season"" at seminyak beach from December to April. It wasn't swimmable when we went, there was so much garbage floating around. I would give it a miss during this time of year, there are much nicer beaches around Bali to enjoy."
NehaVerma1987,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,Very Clean beach with good sand and less number of tourists. Nice place to spend and enjoy a day.Near to bog and famour reaorts and villas.
Jordan D,23 contributions,Apr 2017,During the period I was in Seminyak the wind blew all the rubbish and waste onshore. Leaving the beaches littered and the sea dirty. I'm used to seeing this while traveling and unfortunately a reality of the way in which plastic is dealt with in this part of the world. 
lynne l,United Kingdom,Mar 2017,"Go to NusaThere is a little shop in Seminyak ,looks nothing. but makes the most fafulous coconut ice cream . You must try it"
cambridgetravller,"Cambridge, UK",Mar 2017,"Unfortunately, I agree with all the negative reviews.  We were staying at  a very good hotel which was sea front and they cleaned the front of the hotel's part of the beach every day so was not responsible for the rest.  The few times we walked we did see a dead dog and dog walkers would let their dogs foul and not pick up after them, so pretty disgusting. The GM of the hotel said that the Government are responsible and as they really don't care a fig as you can see from the rubbish on the beach as well as the streets, that the Government is not exactly ""Green""."
Khaled N,18 contributions,Mar 2017,"The ebach is amazing by sunset, its not recomended for swimming, rather surfing and hanging around there is cool, alot of nice places to dine and drink along the beach"
19flyer91,"Manchester, UK",Apr 2017,"We went to Seminyak for a few days in April and we found the beach to be pretty dirty with litter, broken glass etc all over the sand, not just in 1 area but the 2 or so miles we walked along. The sea was also very brown in some areas. There are much much nicer beaches in other areas of Bali. "
Japan1980,"Las Vegas, NV",Feb 2017,"I was expected to see a beautiful beach in Seminyak but was a big disappointed to see a lot of garbage on the beach like plastic bags,plastic wrapped and cans. The waves are very high, not able to swim either. Black sand not a problem if the beach is clean. I would say Nusa Dua beach more beautiful, cleanest and quiet than Seminyak beach. "
CMAX2012,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,"Perhaps living in Australia with its pristine beaches has spoiled us, but I wouldn't even walk on those carbage strewn places you don't know what's buried , there's no excuse for the dirt there, it is only slightly better than Kuta beach. Bali needs to sort its beaches out to bring them up to a family friendly status."
Ali P,11 contributions,Mar 2017,"High waves. Not suitable for swimming but good for surfing. Water was not clean. We saw things like plastic bags and candy rapers floating in the water.Lots of people walking around  trying to sell you bracelets, glasses, bows, paintings ... etc.Lots of restaurants and shops around. If you are looking for a busy beach this is for you. If you want peace and crystal clear waters then this is not the best option."
Lyle K,"Sarasota, FL",Apr 2017,"On a recent visit to this Beach I was astonished at how dirty the beach was. I'm mean this is Bali. I understand that the tide brings in trash everyday, but this wasn't overnight garbage.  I travel the world and even in the poorest countries I have never seen anything like this before. If all the restaurants would just take care of their portion then the beach would be more attractive for all..."
Donald G,"Louisville, KY",Apr 2017,"Dirty, lots of trash but warm water and good time.  We went to a surf school and we all caught a few waves. "
Robert G,24 contributions,Apr 2017,"Two ""streams"" ran from busy town into the sea. it did not smell very nice and put us off the sea. Sea was rough and Red flags up so again not as good as many other beaches I have been to."
PeterMM3,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2017,"Very dirty beach, lots of rubbish and discoloured water. Parts of the each covered in brown/green sludge and general garbage everywhere."
Dana G,6 contributions,Apr 2017,This beach is raved about and I don't know why! It was so dirty on the beach and there was so much rubbish in the water. Most of the restaurants on the beach were quite run down. Lots of people offering you to buy different accessories/paintings/toys. This beach definitely needs a clean up! Will not revisit and would not recommend to others. 
KAYRA,OXFORD UK,Mar 2017,"Our hotel was a few mins walk from Seminyak beach.... It's wide and waves are huge .... You get a variety of bars and restaurants to choose from.... It's nicer and calmer than Kuta Beach ....In the evenings there were loads of lanterns lights lit up and big bonfire in front of some restaurants.... Lovely atmosphere...Nice stroll and amazing sunset as it's anywhere else in Bali ....You watch people riding horses or walking , surfing .... We didn't dare to go in to the sea as it looked very scary and waves were big .... But beautiful all the same .... If you keep walking then you reach the much busier Kuta beach ... More going on there .... The reason for a 4 star rating is the sewerage smell and the rubbish .... Probably coming from the hotels we don't know ... Bali and its beaches are definitely worth a visit... "
Jennifer R,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2017,I'm not sure where some of these other reviewers went but in early April 2017 there was simply not much beach left. Waves crashed right up to the restaurants and it was virtually impossible to walk along the beach! There was a larger amount of dirty grey sand near the temple which was full of rubbish and dogs. The lesson I repeatedly learn is that if I want white pristine beaches I should just stay at home ( Australia ) Make sure you book a place with a pool 
David L,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,One of the nicer stretches of beach near Kuta. A number of nice hotels and restaraunts along here to choose from. Beach was clean and on some days the surf was excellent. 
Margaret19606,"Texas Gulf Coast, TX",Mar 2017,We spent our time in the hotel pool which overlooked the beach.  The beech is sandy and clean and lovely for a stroll in the evening.

fionji,Milano,Jun 2016,"We stayed in Seminyak during our holiday and would often come here in the mornings to enjoy the sun. Plenty of space on the beach, there are some great food stalls all along."
NickPay,"Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"Walk along Seminyak beach, enjoy the sunset and take in the energy of this beautiful beach.Try one of the beachfront restaurants and eat dinner as the sun sets over the sea."
Kate O,"Los Angeles, CA",Mar 2017,"After traveling all over Bali and Lombok and seeing some really beautiful beaches, this one wasn't really that impressive. I was happy to see the water and get my feet in the sand but it wasn't pristine or calming. If you're looking for a really nice beach, try heading away from the city a little."
Ceri E,"Bristol, UK",Mar 2017,"Before we went to Bali i done research on the local beaches and a large percentage of the reviews were not great so we were not surprised when we arrived to see it full of rubbish and not really inviting, it's worth a visit to say you've seen it as it's only a 15 minute walk from the centre of Seminyak or 5 minutes in a taxi 30,000 one way...What I would recommend is to hire a cab to take you to some beaches as there's no local transport if you want to spend a day hanging out at the beach..."
ennasila6,14 contributions,Mar 2017,"Dinner on the beach, watching the sun go down, followed by fireworks and Balinese dancing....can't be beaten!"
larrym0527,"Camas, Washington",Mar 2017,"Wonderful beach, litteraly just on the edge of the city... Great beach walk.  The sunsets are the best in the world.  We were lucky to watch a fantastic lightening show over the Indian Ocean at sunset.  Fantastic does not begin to describe."
Rschagrin,"Delray Beach, FL",Mar 2017,A public beach on the Indian Ocean. Very soft grey sand. You can rent chairs and umbrellas. It is pretty wide.
Joon,"Los Angeles, CA",Mar 2017,"I went down to Seminyak Beach for the first time expecting a beach of paradise. What I saw instead was a beach full of trash, stray dogs running around, some brown water in the beach and some red flags that's telling you not to go into the water. Trash. That's what I felt as I was walking around in the water and on the beach. There are lot of TRASH. I couldn't stand in the water for a minute without some kind of trash touching my feet. Wrappers, Cloths, or whatever. Trash. Now I come from Los Angeles where there are a lot of people that go in the water and has commercial businesses all around. Even LA beaches felt it was cleaner and more sanitary than here. I couldn't believe all the amount of trash floating in the water and debris on the beach. I thought this was supposed to be a paradise, instead it felt like where all the trash ended up. Granted some of them could be from Bali and some of them could be from elsewhere just washing up here. Regardless, it felt dirty just standing in the water with the damn trash touching my feet every 10 seconds or so!I saw some brown water and thought it was weird that the water was so brown. Not all parts but some parts. I asked around why the water was brown and no one knew. Also there were red flags all around and when I asked around, people were saying because the wind was strong and that you could get sucked out to the ocean due to fast & strong current. Also there are apparently whirlpools that will suck you in. That's a scary thought. I've also seen some stray dogs running around. One time I saw a pack of 5 dogs all playing with each other on the beach. Sure that sounds cute except when you come to realize that some of these dogs could have rabies, probably had no owners, and that they were playing in the beach where people were. I'm sure the dogs don't think about where to pee and poop. I'm from USA where there are regulations against dogs on the beach due to them crapping and peeing which contaminates the water. In Seminyak I've seen a lot of stray dogs around which didn't help the feeling I got about the hygiene and cleanliness of the water. The water was very warm. That was one plus about the beach. With the clouds far away and the sandy beach all around, this was a plus. There weren't that many pluses given I've also been to beaches in Thailand which were freakin Awesome."
842colin,"Bournemouth, UK",Mar 2017,"I have travelled for many years and can honestly say l have never seen so much rubbish on a beach. even when you enter the water you are walking in floating plastic and any other form of garbage. The locals are only interested in selling you over priced drinks, or renting you a board for 4 times the price you would pay 5 mins walk away to a side street shop. They are not interested in your comfort if you don't want to lie on the dirty beaches of kuta ,legion or Seminyak you can rent an over priced sun bed."
Peter_Mogensen,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Mar 2017,"This could be the most fantastic place. The view is absolutely stunning, not only at sunset but also during the day.Sadly all the garbage and rubbish from the ocean is just lying there in the sand - spoiling the beach."
Jessi-leigh B,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,Massages tickCold drinks tickBeautiful sunsets tickFriendly people tick This place has it all! 3rd time visiting I will 110% be back.. have added bars and restaurants we visited 
Sally F,"Brighton, UK",Mar 2017,"After having travelled across South east Asia our expectations for Bali beaches were high. Sorry to say we were disappointed except for Seminyak Beach. It was the only one that is being actively kept clean. Only thing is the locals will try to sting you for the sun loungers. We paid 100,000 (£6.00 approximately) for 2 beds for 4 hours. I think we overpaid. He originally wanted 200,000. "
Paulinha,"County Dublin, Ireland",Mar 2017,"The sand is black and water is not clear, but this is not the issue. If you don't want to lie on the rubbish, avoid this beach. "
Katie M,"Aberdeen, UK",Mar 2017,"Perhaps ignorance and lack of research on our part, but the beach itself is dirty, covered with dog's mess and has extremely strong currents. So if you're looking for a romantic stroll and dip in the Ocean, prepare to be disappointed! "
Priyanka Kwatra,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2017,"Great restaurants and shacks are located on the beach which get crowded during sunset. You can surf, take a horse ride and enjoy your drinks and food here. Kids love it. A bit dirty though.."
ShahBulgaria,"Varna, Varna, Bulgaria",Mar 2017,Bali is a place known for surfing and so the tides are harsh for swimmers... so swimmers be careful... for the people and families who want to enjoy the holiday on the beach please take your rubbish with you as you can see many people like you left their rubbish there... When I say people like you I mean humans so do not get offended and try to keep a larger clean vision in life
MaryAnnPerth,Perth,Mar 2017,The first night we went there was great buzz on the beach. A few nights later it was weird. And if you're looking for snow white sand forget it.  There are enough restaurants and bars to find something to keep most people happy. 
Delhibelly0410E,"Edmonton, Canada",Mar 2017,Very sad to see so much plastic and garbage on the beach and in the water. Not pleasant to have plastic wrap around your legs when you go swimming. Locals claim it comes from the sea but it's being washed out from the streets every time it rains. Bali is choking under the weight of its own success. A pity to see it now compared to when I was there in 1974. Very sad!!
Torben,20 contributions,Mar 2017,"We were quite disappointed by the amount of trash at the beach. We just did a beach walk from Seminyak down to Legian. We wouldn't go here with our kids, not even on our own. It's sad to see places like this ruined by garbage."
Nariman E,31 contributions,Mar 2017,"Overall nice, with the exception of 'beach' vendors and 'brownish' water at places. Lots of sunscreen recommended though, sun is tricky and you can easily get burnt."
Roland D,"London, UK",Mar 2017,"The beach was not crowded and the water was lovely and warm.  But the waves meant it was not easy to swim.  And the water had a greenish-brown tinge.  I wondered where the sewerage is discharged from all the local hotels...   There are places along the shore to buy drinks, food and to rent sun beds.  "
Jon S,"Fremantle, Australia",Mar 2017,This beach is seriously filthy - full of discarded rubbish and an open sewer runs out to the ocean - which stinks. I would not swim or surf at this beach. This needs closing and a serious clean up.
Rajat A,"New Delhi, Delhi, India",Apr 2016,Lovely beach and amazing atmosphere. plenty of eateries around and you can do several water activities. Overall a must visit place for couples of families alike.
Roger W,"Bristol, UK",Mar 2017,"Beautiful long golden sandy beach. It's kept clean & tidy. Varied selection of beach bars & cafes spilling onto the beach - music can be annoying! Get the usual beach sellers, all licensed but they are persistent! Plenty of surfing etc. Really great beach."
Arve K,"Southern Norway, Norway",Mar 2017,"We visited this beach on 20. March, a sunny warm day in Bali. We sat for 2 hours in a restaurant with spectacular view of the beach. A nice and mild breeze made our time there enjoyable and outstanding. I reccommend a visit at Seminyak Beach!"
Sherri A,"London, England, United Kingdom",Mar 2017,"Average beach, very dirty. Full of expensive sun loungers with nowhere to lie on the sand. Also there are so many people trying to sell you things every two minutes, who do not take no for an answer - spoiled our overall experience here"
Reza K,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2017,"It was not clean enough and you cant find white sands, full of girls who looking for business!! May be not good for families."
Martin C,3 contributions,Mar 2017,We were there after a stom so there is rubish all over the beach so we didn't swim the people who sell on the beach are a little bit anoring but after you get use to that its a wonderful place with food and drinks even were your choice we and what you do the chiars on the beach are of rent so if you don't mind playing a little money you can sit on the beach and get a massage  it really wonderful way to spend time 
Deeana_L,"Ubud, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"I love swimming on this beach in the morning, when there are still less people there... This beach has a nice wave and many surfers like it too. Seminyak beach is one of the best places to see sunset in Bali so no wonder if this place is always full around that time..."
Khatleen M,Curepipe,Mar 2017,"Pretty good place to chill at sunset and to eat in the evening with lots of restos lining up the beach till Double Six. With their nice colourful umbrellas, it's quite a sight."
Shanu D,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2016,I feel the beaches at Kuta and Legian were more happening than the seminyak beach! The water was also pretty sandy and sticky! 
philjanal,13 contributions,Mar 2017,"Nice big beaches, first look awesome but rubbish everywhere on beach, storm water from streets run straight in "
Dieter B,"Redland City, Australia",Mar 2017,"This beach can have a lot of litter washed up each morning, but it is cleaned each morning. Lots of people walk this beach each morning for exercise. This is easy to do especially when the tide is out. Good for swimming and surfing , but look out for the strong current when the waves wash back out"
282Tourist,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2017,"Perfect for a morning or evening walk,  Not much of a swimming beach since the waves are very high ans strong so mostly for surfers.  It looked fgairly clean but seeing two dogs defecating in the beach was not something I wanted to see.  The evenings were great just relaxing and watching the beautiful sunsets."
ShawnD2010,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2017,"nice to walk along at sunset and listen to the music from the various beachside bars, very relaxing part of bali"
Shaiful_Noh,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2017,Cleanliness is an issue here. The sunset was good although it is not a white sandy beach but can always try to end a day here renting a sand bag sipping some mocktails and ice-cream with the kid.
Jessie,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beach itself is relatively clean, with a nice view. On super hot days there was an oder - I suspect from the rubbish behind the restaurants along the beach front. It was quite unpleasant and we could not stay long. Would recommend going at sunset/night as it's a bit cooler and the lanterns that are put up make for a very nice view. "
ahadley2017,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2017,I thought this beach was stunning especially in the early morning when there are less people and at sunset when there are stunning sunsets over the water. A lot of rubbish washes up on this beach but I've been told that's seasonal and there were people cleaning the beach in the early morning.
Lilypad P,"London, UK",Mar 2017,Go to Seminyak for the sunset views at one of the beach bars as they are priceless. Unfortunately there is just far too much litter on the beach that makes the sand look horrible.
Mj_phill,"Greater Perth, Australia",Mar 2017,Beach is not as clean but the sunsets are perfect and not crowded like the ones in Kuta. Stop off at ku da tah. Potato head or the Alila for drinks 
PJD1978,swansea,Mar 2017,"We would rock up at this beach at the end of a long hot day, and just grab a bean bag in one of the many beach bars and watch the sunset. It's a beautiful setting and so relaxing. The one issue is in some parts there is some mess and waste, this could easily be cleaned up by the local government each night."
reetsb27,40 contributions,Mar 2017,"We were here in March 2017 and the beach was quite clean. We were lucky to be staying at Alila with an Ocean view room so it was great waking up to see locals and tourist having morning walks and having fun. From Alila, we walked along the beach front to Kuta which didn't take long (prob shorter than a taxi ride!) and we also walked in the opposite direction towards Canggu. On our walks we discovered a few local bars (no hype type...) on beach front, so take some Rp with you for a quick stop and support the locals."
kyliesteward,"Cleveland, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beach is rather dirty but since we have come back it has improved a fair bit and they are doing dinners and drinks along the beach, more festive to go at night"
Brigitte T,"Deepwater, Australia",Mar 2017,"Presently at Alila --Seminyak. The beach is fabulous here, you just step down a few steps and you're there.from Courtyard it's about 300 m to the beach, too overcrowded I feel."
catrina p,"Jaco, Costa Rica",Mar 2017,"Unfortunately with current beach covered in pollution, they did have signs up apologizing for it, effort was been made to clean it up! Water was warm rough, great for surfing, unfortunately no swimming was permitted during the week 1 was there signs everywhere! "
Emma A,11 contributions,Mar 2017,Coming from South Africa with our beautiful white sand beaches it has been quite a shock to see so much litter in the ocean. It makes me feel really sad. We are lucky enough to be doing a home exchange and staying at the 5 star Anantura Hotel right on the beach so we just swim in the pool here. It's a great wave for beginners to learn to surf though and my boyfriend had such fun while I taught him on a long board we rented for R50 an hour right in front of our hotel on the beach. Haggle the price of board rentals with the locals so they don't rip you off! 
nvsa008,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2017,The beach was safe and hassle free. neat small waves to body surf. Nobody was in the water until the three of us went in and about 10 followed. They all appeared to be having a great time body surfing.
saf16,"Ettalong Beach, Australia",Feb 2017,Did not like Seminyak beach the sand was black & in certain areas it was smelly due to some outlets running from the streets through to the beach. 
Camila S,"Curitiba, PR",Mar 2017,"Nice beach if you want to chill and have drinks with friends!It gets pretty crowded, since most beaches around have reefs and stones, and this is a sand beach, but it's still niceGood sunset view Unfortunately, many garbage left at the beach, like most places in Bali "
LukeE1978,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beautiful relaxing place to visit. Food, drinks, entertainment right there, no need to wander any further!"
Darren C,"Edinburgh, UK",Mar 2017,"A visit to Seminyak beach is not relaxing. There is rubbish everywhere, dogs running about and doing the toilet in the ocean. You are harassed constantly from not only the deck chair men but also kids trying to sell bracelets, and other people selling watches and sunglasses. You get touched often by women trying to offer manicures and pedicures and massages!! To top it all off, we watched a women remove her baby's dirty nappy, wash the kid in the sea and then bury the nappy in the sand, 50m in front of us!!!!Not exactly tranquil or picturesque! "
abbyh86,"Inverell, Australia",Mar 2017,"Great atmosphere, dirty beach. Be prepared for people wanting to sell you anything and everything. Live music and drinks were great. "
mindy4715,"Fort Wayne, IN",Mar 2017,"This beach was closest to our hotel - within walking distance but it is poorly maintained.  Outside showers were turned off, so there was no way to rinse the sand off.  No other facilities available."
Parvesh S,"Leicester, UK",Dec 2016,Not sure what I can say about a beach butt he only reason it doesn't get 5/5 is because it can get a bit busy and can be a bit annoying with people always trying to sell you stuff.
BradfromSydney,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2017,The beach was filthy and covered in rubbish. Stray dogs all over the place and lots of dog poop. The weather wasn't particularly good either but the overall cleanliness left a lot to be desired.
FunkyMarshmallow,"Bournemouth, UK",Mar 2017,"This is one of the most disgustingly dirty beaches I have ever seen and I have travelled. The amount of rubbish washed up on the beach and not cleared away is a disgrace and an example of the crisis our oceans are suffering.  Why anyone would want to come and sit on it and look out at the rubbish is beyond me and why any Aussie would come from the beautiful beaches in Australia to surf here is crazy.  I went for an early morning run and had to wash my trainers after because I ran through the streams that led into the sea, the smell was so bad, god knows what is in that water and now in the sea."
dru d,4 contributions,Feb 2017,"So far, it's clean n nice to chill n relax.. $10 for pair of seats plus free coconut drink.. Well, sit back n enjoy the view.. 👙😎"
343jenny,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beach is great waves good for surfing, lounges cost 200,000 Rp per day $20Drinks available from vendors just don't have the ice."
Jenry D,"Klotten, Germany",Feb 2017,"Beautiful Beach, but it was kinda dirty. A lot of Plastic rubbish on the beach. Maybe it was very very bad Weather for 4 days. But I hope they will clean it. On Sunday was very crowded, many local people as well, they played football on the beach. Otherwise we love the beach."
Priyanka C,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Feb 2017,Good to hang out from morning to dusk. Sip in some really good beverages or try out some awesome dishes while relaxing at the beach from the numerous restaurants present there !
Danielevario,"Marina di Carrara, Italy",Jul 2016,"I've been in Bali in july 2016 and i think i'll return there next year! Amazing island, amazing people, gorgeous food😍"
Jamie C,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2017,"Whenever we go out for a meal we try to make it back to our hotel via the beach.As others have mentioned, there is a fair bit of rubbish that washes up which is a shame, so you need to be careful of where you tread at times.Seminyak Beach has vast expanses of sand and is very flat so a great beach for walking.We sat outside Ku De Ta so we could hear the music and relax while the sun went down.Others were sitting on a picnic blanket with a bottle of wine doing the same.Sunset draws a huge crowd but there is plenty of room for everyone."
kokolig,Los Angeles,Jan 2017,It's generally a dirty beach but has some of the best sunsets on earth.  You could stroll onto some famous beach clubs and enjoy the music and crowds.
Hasry WirAmici,12 contributions,Feb 2017,Perfect place to chill with your love ones whilst watching the sunset. Clean beach with soft white sand.
dorinka n,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Mar 2017,"For me the ocean always had a soothing effect on my mood. At Seminyak beach, you have endless stretches of beach for your toes to hug. If surfing is your thing, then the long breakers will be the stuff that dreams are made off."
KerryJane65,Perth,Jan 2017,"Stunning setting spoilt by plastic plastic and more plastic.  Where does it come from?  Bali needs to get a strict eco friendly program - like Rowanda. The beaches in front of Potato Head,  Semaya, Ku De Ta ect are clean. "
Christanf,"Dudley, UK",Feb 2017,Mile upon mile as far as my eyes could see top $ beach and awesome sunset bars on front rip off as usual drink lots and lots of water and then drink some more 
sahil a,22 contributions,Feb 2017,I went early in the morning on a weekday..Bt I cudnt find anything interesting..It's not that clean also..It's good if u just wanna jog Nd enjoy the silence..The climate of bali is hot Nd the sun cums out fast so I would recommend to try another beaches like Kuta Beach or jimbaran..
Simon G,"Toulouse, France",Sep 2016,"One of my favorite beach in Bali, great for chilling and enjoying the sunset, but you can also surf or swim"
Eka P,35 contributions,Feb 2017,Spiritually centre position next to Petitengit pura near this beach. Great place to have a cocktail and watch the sun go down at La Lucciola. 
Paul M,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2017,Prices are a little more expensive for beach chairs but you pay for cleanliness and less of a crowd. Surf is great if 5ft swell or better from low to mid tide with long running lefts and rights. Great for sunset surf with kudeta playing chill out house music in the background. 
Anniemaykay,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,Maybe we went the wrong time of year?? Beach was dirty and not somewhere I'd like to swim. Better beaches in Australia.
ClaireT79,"Phuket, Thailand",Feb 2017,Really dirty beach. My husband surfed here and said the waves were good but not so fun wadding out in plastic and rubbish. If you like beaches on your holiday do not go to this side of Bali in rainy season go East
Michael C,182 contributions,Nov 2016,"We found this beach to be one of the nicest during our time in Bali.Its not as hectic as the others but yet still boasting lots of local character, the bars are rather more upmarket but yet you can still find the odd local hideaway thats well worth the find so its a lovely blend of local to luxurious.The good thing we loved was that your not as bothered by all the beach sellers as you are on other beaches and also the sellers here are a lot more chilled."
janetcF1052UJ,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"We loved this beach and it holds many fond memories for us. I especially loved it early in the morning when the stall holders and cafes were setting up.  The various fishermen with their long casting rods were a curious sight amongst the surfers, yet this amazing beach could accommodate us all!  "
SynNetwork,"Las Vegas, NV",Feb 2017,"Beach was nice, but had a bunch of signs up for No swimming.  Only for surfers or sun bathing.  Sun is very strong, apply plenty lotion. "
JDandHK,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Feb 2017,You can't ignore the trash on the beach and the black coloured sand that's originated from volcanics.The beach was not attractive and I haven't found one redeeming feature of Bali that would get me back.
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2017,We have been to most of the beaches around here and this is our favourite. It is probably the cleanest and has lots to do to keep you occupied through the day.Many places rent sun bed and umbrellas quite cheaply and some restaurants even allow you to use their bean bags for free as long as you give them your custom. There are lots of bars and restaurants in the area and also lots of beach traders. The sand  itself is generally of good quality and you can use the beach to either relax or undertake more strenuous activities. There is lots of surfing and we used to do long beach walks. 
Cherie P,"Leongatha, Australia",Feb 2017,Went for a wander down to the beach last night and got the shock of my life. There where hundreds of beanbags and people sitting watching the sun set it was amazing. Restaurants all the way along with very friendly staff and great service. Bands played the whole time we were there. Definitely a must to do at night while on Seminyak 
Sal,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,"What fabulous sunsets! And what blue water during the day! Sadly, parts of the beach are littered with rubbish. But the other parts are very clean. The beach has black sand.At the time we went during the day, a swim was out of the question due to the red warning flags, as the sea was rough, but am sure it is a pleasant enough sea to swim in."
BeaBC,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2017,"There were gorgeous beaches, and others that were not so nice. The part in behind the Oberoi Hotel and Ku De Ta was fabulous. I even got a chair and a massage on the beach there. "
rowanc932,33 contributions,Feb 2017,"Walked down to this beach which took about half an hour from the main road, a little bit of a walk but it was nice. As soon as we got there I went in for a swim which was good. The beach was a little bit smelly and quite a bit of rubbish around which was a bit disappointing. It is a really rough beach so be careful swimming here!! I would recommend checking out the sunset here tho "
Chicco_Bp,"Budapest, Hungary",Dec 2016,"Not the best beach i have ever seen, but cozy, hot and dark sand.Don't wait Seychelle-like place but enjoy the different type:)"
Susannah L,14 contributions,Feb 2017,"Although friends had warned me about this beach..I wasn't prepared for how much rubbish was in the water/being washed ashore. It was pretty disturbing. I won't be back for swimming, except to help on beach clean up days."
Camila Toth,"Sao Caetano do Sul, SP",Feb 2017,"Personally I don't really like the beaches here in Bali, all beaches are dirty , no expected beautiful beaches around Bali! Near our hotel there was a sewer! Not really good to see! Ok, all sunset are really amazing ! If u wanted to see the culture , ok! People here are so king and happy ! "
David F,rotherham,Feb 2017,"I have seem cleaner landfill sites!!!Sort it out Bali, its not good for tourism, the environment or anything else for that matter."
Feodora M,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2017,This is a nice beach with a lot of beachclubs but there are so many tourists and the sea and sand is not that esthetically pleasing as other beaches in Bali
MissLadyBB,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,"The beach is beautiful, there are waves, surfers, lots of locals selling goods, beach bars with bean bags, good food and drinks. It's not too busy, and you can walk to everywhere. "
MrAndMrsKennedy,"Los Angeles, CA",Dec 2016,"I'll believe it when I see it, but I can't imagine there ever being a nice time to visit this beach. We were there in December and it was covered in trash. You couldn't walk on the beach, let alone fathom going in the water. AVOID in December!!"
viktorija,"Hvar, Croatia",Jan 2017,"Beach and sea are so dirty, i was afraid to go swimming because of so much garbage. Only nice thing are sunsets"
Chris C,"Honolulu, HI",Feb 2017,"Not a fan of the beach here. It is a very gritty and crunchy sand. Not good to walk in. They attempt to keep it clean and in the mornings it is mostly okay, but when the tide comes in so does all of the trash. It becomes like a dump site. I don't know how anyone walks on this beach barefoot, especially in the evenings. It is really disappointing and a bit alarming."
Mari_Star_Kitty,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,"The beach in Seminyak is a hive of activity with surfing lessons, food and drinks, shopping (traveling sales people) swimming, sun bathing and a range of activities and entertainment.Beautiful dark sand that is extremely fine, with a sparkling element to it.A nice place to spend the day.Enjoy."
Linsog,19 contributions,Feb 2017,There were a lot of trash on the beach. Might have been because of the rain season? There were also a red flag up so we didn't try to swim. 
kyrajc,"Vancouver, Canada",Feb 2017,The hype is totally justified! Try anything and it will be amazing. I LOVED the pancakes! Staff is awesome!
Al_Subi,35 contributions,Feb 2017,"I visites this beach in Feb 2017. I know that Seminyak beach is known for its magnificent sunsets. This fame is teuly well-deserved. Enjoying the sunset while relaxing in one of the beach side clubs and restaurants, or strolling on the beach while admiring how the sky slowly transformed from blue to orange to black here is truly a great experience."
Geet,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,I visited the beach late evening so didnt quiet enjoy the sunny beach. However it was nice and calm for a pleasant walk and to while away one of your evenings if you have EXTRA TIME
foongherili,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2017,"Enjoyed a slow barefooted walk from Seminyak beach all the way to Kuta. Took about 1.5hours in the evening. The sun was a little scotching but the view was magnificent. The beach was quiet (at Seminyak end) and picturesque. Went we were at Kuta beach, the sun was setting and it was perfect to take in a moment to marvel at the wonders of nature and how fortunate were we to enjoy a holiday.We got a little sunburned after the walk though.. so 10/10 would recommend sunblock. :p "
DP710,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,"You do not go to Seminyak for the beach. It's dirty and very rough, stick to the poolside here and head to Nusa Dua or other areas for a nicer beach experience."
anita_02_2017,"Zhenjiang, China",Feb 2017,"It was a dirty beach. Drinks are kind of expensive for it's location. One of the positives is that there are plenty of people to learn to surf from! And when people come up to you to sell you stuff, they'll usually leave you alone after a simple no. "
Violet F,4 contributions,Feb 2017,The only good thing about this beach is the sunset. I would not swim there personally. There is a good market at the back with many bars and restaurants to chose from to watch the sunset with a drink in hand.!
SUEBIDOUX,"Terrebonne, Canada",Feb 2017,"Great clean beach but very load music everywhere as well as beach vendors trying to sell their stuff and trying and trying again,the same came around at least 3 times...but still great big beach and lively sunset.would not spend one week here but for a couple of days,great beach ambiance!"
David F,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2017,"Seminyak beach is beautiful, stretching for kilometers. Great for walking, surfing (body, bogey board and just surfboard), and taking amazing photographs of Bali Beach Life and, of course, beautiful sunsets. It is also lined with some amazing places to eat and sleep (see my other reviews for Seminyak) which are perfect for a drink, a meal or just  enjoying the almost nightly beautiful sunsets. This would be a five star beach except for two, or three caveats. One is that alot of people have dogs in Bali and bring them on the beach. Which means if you like to walk barefoot on the beach, like I do, then you need to pay extra attention that you don't step into a fresh dog droppings. Two is that at various points along the beach there are effluents from various parts of town. This is raw sewage. I either walk out in the surf to cross them or just turn around and walk the other way. Needless to say, you don't want to be swimming directly offshore, or down current unless you've had all your shots!;) Thirdly is a new hazard which I only noticed on this last trip, which is broken shards of glass from beer bottles. The ones I spotted at low tide were in the shallow water and constantly being covered and uncovered by the trailing surf. I made a mental note to myself to pack my white water sandals next time I come. It's really a shame that such a beautiful natural spot as Seminyak is being polluted in this way. But while the above hazards do detract from the water and beach activities they do not affect the absolutely amazing sunsets. "
jennyjenjen925,"Portland, OR",Feb 2017,"My dad and I strolled down to the beach right around sunset and caught a magnificent view. The beach is crowded with lots of activity but still beautiful. We enjoyed snapping pictures, walking around and then grabbing a drink and listening to live music as we watched it set. It might not be the best beach for swimming but the nightlife looked great and it was relatively clean (compared to other areas). Definitely not secluded - tons of tourists. "
Kim Maaike J,5 contributions,Feb 2017,The beach has an amazing sunset but because of the rain season the water is a little bit dirty and rough. I won't recommend swimming in this time a year. 
Errol S,"Forest Creek, Australia",Feb 2017,"I would loved to have swum at this beach but when I saw what washed up, I couldn't. If what you can see is bad, what about what you can't see? It's still bussing with people and activity however and has a great atmosphere but swimmers were noticeably absent. They do keep sweeping it up but they really need to address the source of the problem for the sake of tourism as well as nature. "
Rajat L,5 contributions,Feb 2017,The whole beachis a good visit if you are staying in that area. Nothing worth to be specially done from far off distances.It has few cafes on the beach which have Lazy Boys outside and you can sit and relay and enjoy few drinks while watching the sunset. They even have live bands playing in front of many Cafe's which are pretty decent for a lazy and relaxed evening.
Neenienoo,100 contributions,Feb 2017,It's a great place to sit watch the sunsetThe beach is dirty and full of rubbish if you get pass this it's a nice spot Lots of music lots of hagglers that drive you crazy The drinks are cheap but our cokes were hot 
AO-Melbourne,45 contributions,Jan 2017,Absolutely stunning beach. Great for a stroll or a jog. Nice way to view all the hotels with a beach front. However there is a lot of rubbish/debris all over the beach. I wouldn't swim in it. 
Colin J,"Vienna, Austria",Feb 2017,"Lovely long beachfront, would imagine this is a good place for surfers due to the amazing waves, relaxing just sitting there watching the waves. Top."
Carly_Grindall,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2017,Sad to see the beach littered with rubbish that's been washed up or just dumped by people who don't care. The sand is dirty and it's certainly not a beach I would want to swim in. 
Emma G,24 contributions,Feb 2017,"We were disappointed with how dirty it was but found really good restaurants along the beach. Since seminyak is pretty expensive going to a eating on the beach is a good option and you get a great view. Coconuts are 20k and we found great food for 30k. If you like vegan food a place called spicy coconut is worth a visit, just a 5 minute walk off the beach (north part of the beach, near canggu)."
Тимур У,11 contributions,Feb 2017,"It has a picturesque sunset!!! Thera are a lot of bars and cafes with wifi along the beach area. Waves are large, so it's good for surfing. "
technomumBrisbane,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2017,"Beach was very dirty with a lot of debris washing in from recent rain.  However, an attendant was collecting it for disposal.  There are plenty of lounge chairs for hire on the each and a life guard is in attendance.  I believe a beautiful sunset can be viewed from here but unfortunately it was overcast when I was there."
Toby Cheong,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,The beach has litter not cleared and a bit of smell due to them. It's not so clean and pleasant after all. Quite disappointing.
kristychef,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2017,"Cleaner than kuta, and great beach clubs to visit. Walked alone the beach for an hour or so, relaxing walk as you aren't hassled a lot by people trying to sell you stuff"
Barbara A,"Lakes Entrance, Australia",Feb 2017,"A panoramic beach, black sand, with many walkers. One can rent a sun lounge but do get some quotes before settling on the right one. Cafes are on the beach front. Overall has a nice feel."
ahujarj,"Mumbai, India",Oct 2016,"A very nice long clean stretch of beach, superb for a good run or even just a walk, If your a guest at SAMAYA u'll have the pleasure of chilling on the seaside lounger sipping iced water or a drink, its bliss…and those moments just stay with you..."
ambersal,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"Slightly better the monstrosity which is Kuta beach. Cleaner, but it is still nothing special. We found a small spot to sunbathe in but that's about it. The water was brown and the waves were strong, wouldn't recommend for kids "
wayneNkris,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2017,"Went for a walk along the beach at Seminyak for about 45 minutes and we were saddened to see the amount of rubbish washed up on the shoreline. Considering the beaches on Bali are the main attraction, I believe that a lot more should be done to clean them up and keep them clean. There were literally thousands of plastic bags, drinking straws, cigarette lighters and innumerable other items that just should not belong on a beach.One can only be saddened to think of what this rubbish, particularly the plastic bags, is doing to the sea life.Please Bali - Clean up your act!"
Ben T,14 contributions,Feb 2017,Waiters don't give your change expect it as a tip. Often price of bill different from original order from menu. Food not as ordered and undercooked
MBCCritics,33 contributions,Feb 2017,"All the rubbish being washed up on the shore. There were cleaners but still very dirty. Don't dare to go into the sea, just got some tanning. Worse part was the oily water."
Soraya2404,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jan 2017,"Was disappointed when i eventually made it to the beach. Litter was strewn throughout the beach and I literally had to watch my step. My hopes of catching a tan on the beach was shattered. Could just be that i visited the wrong time of year, but should i visit bali again, Nasu Dua would def be my choice."
snowieWales,Wales,Dec 2016,walked out onto the beach and was shocked by the level of rubbish on it.  One woman trying to sweep it all into piles.  Not somewhere I would like to spend my holiday.
wpcheah,"Lucerne, Switzerland",Feb 2017,"Human footprints everywhere, besides that overall it's a great beach. Powerful waves ideal for surfing"
Taipei921,Singapore,Jan 2017,"Wide expanse of endless beach, shared by many hotels dotting the whole strip of beach. The waves are excellent for surfers but perhaps it was this time of the year, that the sea seems to churn up the muddy sandbed and cause the pristine blue water to turn brownish as the waves washes ashore, exposing the filth and plastics along the beach. It is otherwise lovely, and a great place for enjoying the sun and the natural sea breeze. When the sun sets, the afterglow of the setting sun is reflected off the freshly rolled back beach, the contrast and shilouette views makes for perfect sunset photography and sights."
Jeff A,25 contributions,Jan 2017,"Garbage in the water, garbage on the beach and sewage in the streams heading to the ocean. Seminyak is a cool place to visit but if the beach is your focus go elsewhere."
Nikoli D,21 contributions,Feb 2017,Beaches was filled with trash. Very disappointed. Beach had solicitors. No public bathrooms. Not worth going to don't waste your time and money.
Walter_Beijing,"Beijing, China",Feb 2017,"Never saw the beach from Kuta all the way to Seminyak beach and beyond in such a sad state. I loved to walk there for hours but what we saw there yesterday was a disaster:- plastic garbage strewn over the beach everywhere, not 10 meters without stepping on some garbage- those village canals bringing raw sewage to the beach offloading their smelly load into the waters.- brown foam and waves every few hundred meters when another canals lands on the beach- a permanent sewage smell in the air although it was a windy day- beach erosion is a big problem; the beach hotels are fortifying their beach line with cement. The stairs from their gardens to the beach has become one meter longer (Legian Hotel) since I have seen it 3 years ago.We were disgusted and did not go into the waters there. Our little son got a skin rash on legs and back from that sewage water.The government needs to act:- clean the canals- introduce effective waste management- stop corruptionThe hotels and tourist industry should step up to the government and demand environmental improvement!!!Good luck "
Dei G,"Cairns Region, Australia",Feb 2017,Absolutely  filthy with litterMouldy looking beanbags and piles of rubbish everywhere.Walked along to get a sense of the place but never even bothered going back
Mace H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"We arrived into Seminyak late on a Thursday and couldn't wait to see the beach on Wednesday morning. Given the time zone change we were up early so wondered down to the beach for a walk. We go there within 5 minutes but what we found was disappointing. It was low tide and all manner of garbage was washed up and the ocean was brown. There were mane workers sweeping/raking up the mess given the many hotels that line the beach. Over the next week things didn't really improve although it was beautiful to listen to the waves at night. Seminyak is a wonderful place but the beach isn't the highlight. We didn't get to see any outstanding sunsets given cloud cover but what we did see was impressive and we had a wonderful anniversary at La lucciola. Also beware of time share workers posing as tourist officers asking your opinion, they get your hotel, your name and length of stay and then bombard you with phone calls. Not pleasant but our villa did a wonderful job at filtering these."
Gibbs T,6 contributions,Jan 2017,we went here for new years eve. while yes there was rubbish etc due to the high tides and it was crazy busy... there's heaps of amazing restaurants close by to sit back relax and watch the sunset. 
aneta k,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"Seminyak beach must be one of the worst beaches we've been on. It's filthy with rubbish everywhere. We walked all the way from chez gado gado restaurant to Potato head club and the whole stretch was dirty. Also, as you'd expect, it has heaps of locals trying to sell you things and although we understand they are trying to make a living, saying ""no, thank you"" every couple of minutes gets somehow tiring after a while...the dark volcanic sand doesn't help the situation and makes the beach look even dirtier. Water looks muddy and just like the beach is full of rubbish."
Brynell D,12 contributions,May 2016,"Seminyak is an upbeat part of Bali with a little something for everyone. Whether you're looking for relaxation and spirituality, or just a really fun bar run, Seminyak has something for you. Love the locals, some of the nicest people I've met. Also, Seminyak offered greater variety of cuisine and dining options than Kuta.You can have Indonesian streetfood or a five star Continental meal."
CaptUnmesh,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Nov 2016,We stayed at the Anatara Resort on the beach and took a stroll across the beach and it was splendid. We managed to walk for over a couple of miles without any hesitation or break. The beech is cleaner and nicer than the one at Kuta and lesser people come here. There are plenty of inexpensive places to dine on the beach and have a couple of beers. Worth spending time here than KUTA . 
Mike S,"Brighton, Australia",Dec 2016,"The beach was great. Although when they was a high tide or a storm a lot of rubbish was left on the beach, but there were crews cleaning it "
randomEX123,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,"The sunsets here are memorable. However, the plastic and garbage at the beach is sooo soo sad. One can only hope that at one stage cleaning this up becomes a priority (same as people stop dumping in it!). "
T4870,"Cairns, Australia",Jan 2017,"Could be such a beautiful beach and the sunsets are amazing. But the beach needs some care. So much rubbish, saw stray dogs pooping on the beach, plastic everywhere. Its unrelaxing how much you get bothered, especially if you walking along and they want to invite you to sit on the chairs and buy drinks. Gets a bit tiring. Such a shame as I bet the beach used to be pristine but tourism and laziness has now destroyed it. "
dendee2015,"Rochester, UK",Jan 2017,"So much rubbish on the beach, even though people trying to clean it up, but it was a no win situation."
trailblazer119,"Dallas, TX",Dec 2016,"I was stunned when I walked over to Seminyak Beach from my hotel, expecting to take a beautiful picture and instead found the beach covered in garbage.  There seemed to be a lot of clean up efforts going on, but it looked really dismal.  Shame on people for destroying such a beautiful place!"
beckyboo0012,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jan 2017,"Spent an evening lounging in bean bags,  drinking a Bintang while watching the sunset, absolute paradise."
Michael A,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,It is not worth going to a place that admits it has a lot of plastic and nappies floating in its water.  Recently the army has been called out to clean up the beaches they have got so bad but we were there tow days later and they were still unacceptably filthy.  i love Balinese people but there are better places to go on holiday in Asia. People avoiding Bali belly who carefully avoid drinking the water and street eating are surprised when they get ill.  Well this is one of the answers.Time the government stopped milking the place and cleaned it up.
Gabriel11,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"We had never walked along the beach so we decided to catch the shuttle and walk to and along the beach. It was crowded, with several Beach Bars overlooking it. There is quite a lot of litter but I could see people cleaning up, which is good. The sea itself feels like river water. We enjoyed the walk and it reminded us of the past when we were assailed by hawkers who seemed to take rejection of goods personally."
Bob M,"Atlanta, GA",Jun 2016,This beach is so cool. So nice to hang out during the day. Very colorful bars and the waves are beautiful with a nice overspray.
azaferkoker,36 contributions,Jan 2017,Beach is so nice with high quality sand..İts more quite than Kuta&Legian beach..For resting and sunbath its one of the best in Bali..Lot of clubs and bars beside beach.Because of high wawes if not a good swimmer it have high risk for to swim..Prices more expensive than Legian and Kuta beach..
FengXueSG,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,"Seminyak beach offered great wave for surfing, splendid sunset view, easy access to restaurants and shops in Seminyak, and a chain of restaurants and bars along the beach. One problem is, there is a canal (looks like a sewage canal)near Jl Camplung Tanduk cutting through the beach, with piles of waste around the area. This makes the walk from Pura Petitenget to Double six beach (same for the reverse direction)     a little bit unpleasant."
Nino Boss,"Chicago, IL",Jan 2017,"Happy to embrace the Indian Ocean after staying inland for quite some time! I'm unsure if the rainy season has anything to do with it , however Seminyak Beach is completely filthy and dirty and although the sunsets were breath taking I very much enjoyed them from 707, W Hotel and Potato Head Beach Club  "
Dan M,Mongolia,Jan 2017,"By the time I got to Seminyak beach in the morning the day was already hot.  Waves were moderate, and the water looked brown with churned up sand.  I was surprised at the relatively low number of people there. In retrospect I would probably have gone there later in the day to watch the sunset, but had a very pleasant time on the sand nevertheless.  I plan to return."
jpc5166,"Shanghai, China",Jan 2017,This beach was not what I expected.  Since I'm from Florida west coast where we have pure white beaches and I read this beach was fantastic I expected more.  Anyways the waves were great for body surfing. There was a ton of trash floating up on the beach almost as if a barge full of trash had capsized.  And nobody was picking up trash. Maybe this was a one-off event. Not sure.  
MissTandi,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"I know it is not a good view of Seminyak beach during rainy season (Dec - Feb) as there was so many rubbish waved away to the beach. I believe our government has coordinated cleanliness department to keep the beach clean during rainy season...well, they have collected lots of rubbish every morning.Anyway, apart of rainy season...I love these beach"
Made Dodi - Private Driver Bali,"Kuta, Indonesia",Jan 2017,Seminyak beach is a great place for Surfing you will find a lot of Surfing Schools near by. Also there are a lot of nice Restaurants and bars as well as beach Clubs.
Chevaun J,"Chengdu, China",Jan 2017,"Long stretch of beach, however the sea is always rough and windy. Not much to do from my point of view but to chill and enjoy the sunset in the evening with a few friends and some drinks and some fries "
Susan Y,"Garforth, UK",Jan 2017,"To the Balanese government.I understand that the natural tides dump rubbish on the beaches, but there is no visible effort to clear it up! If every hawker was equipped with a litterpicker and a bin bag as part of the deal you'd sort the problem to a more reasonable degree. Billions of tourist dollars over the years should result in something more than an appologising and apologetic sign!Having travelled half way around the world to such a legendary and beautiful place the sea and the beaches are a HUGE disappointment and do you no credit Bali!You let down yourselves and, more importantly, the Balinese people!"
Elaine T,12 contributions,Sep 2016,Good place to have a bintang & watch the day pass by. Chair rental a bit pricey but we didn't barter either. Brought some bracelets from the women. Just be friendly & say no thank you they will leave you alone.  
BushiandFish,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"Could not believe the state of he beachesWhy the government don't do something is beyond meBali survives off tourism, however their beaches are a disgrace Utterly filthy, it's no wonder no one swims in there, or even walks the beaches. CLEAN UP YOUR ACT BALI 👿"
Nabila A,"Markham, Canada",Sep 2016,It was as if I was walking on a movie scene. We started at Kuta and then walked our way back to the hotel in Semniyak just before sunset. 
VThallur,"Chennai (Madras), India",Dec 2016,"Visited the beach close to the Courtyard and it was a BIG disappointment. It was so bad that I couldn't get myself to even take a photograph for uploading. The sands were full of garbage (plastic bottles, soda cans & wrappers). Didn't stay there even for  5 minutes after the 10 minute walk (one way)."
Raphael A,4 contributions,Jan 2017,Dirty and with rats! Go to a resort or you will not enjoy the beach! Maybe we we were unlucky but did not like the beach! 
Donjjjordan,"Maspalomas, Spain",Jan 2017,"We went in January and was very disappointed. The beach was very dirty. The sea was rough and dirty with Brown foam riding the waves, the beach bars were les than inviting with un kept hotels lining the beach front. Sadly this experience was the reason for us relocating to Kayumanis."
Slou18,"Chester, UK",Jan 2017,"My family and I recently visited Bali and stayed in Seminyak for a few days. We visited the beach as we had been at Potato Head. The beach was filthy and the sea polluted. It resembled Rhyl beach but worse (for those of you who have visited the UK) After speaking to our local driver, this was due to the time of year and the change in current which washes up the rubbish in this direction. Not what you would imagine for the Indian ocean. Better beaches to visit were Pandawa beach(the best beach by far) Padang Padang and Kuta beach. "
Jennie M,"Dublin, Ireland",Jan 2017,I'm not sure if we went to the right part but we walked to the beach and it's honestly the dirtiest beach I've ever seen. It's so grim. We have a pool and the town is fab so that will do is but it's such a shame. 
Shazza,"Broadbeach, Australia",Jan 2017,"A great place for sunset watching. Many locals go there. Very dirty beach & not fit for swimming. There's also a very smelly polluted inlet to cross. As a beach it is terrible , sunsets yes"
Madeline K,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jan 2017,"I guess being from Australia I'm blessed with lovely beaches so I'm a bit biased. That being said, I've been to plenty of other beaches around the world that have been nice. Just expect rubbish everywhere and not much going on (understandably). This is the exact reason why it's important to book a nice hotel with a pool. "
Anthony E,"Leeds, UK",Dec 2016,"only went on the beach once it was filthy, rubbish all along the beach and we walked 2 mile on it to the next town"
Maggie M,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jan 2017,"the beach at Seminyak was dirty and disgusting the wind had blown up and it was  full of debri, dirty nappy, cane/bamboo washed up on beach  old polystyrene coffee cups etc we never swan in beach at all and council or govenrmetn had done very little to clean it up we swam at the pools in Montigo which were clean and refreshing. not the beach at all."
Shiramira,"Zurich, Switzerland",Dec 2016,"It's always dificult to rate a beach - as it can change daily due to currents and weather conditions etc..But at the moment - well actually we were there during christmas - the beach is so ugly as there is plastic trash everywhere!! Even if you try to walk into the ocean the plastic swims around your legs and there is at least 6 meters wide plastic trash ""raod"" at the beach.The only good thing is that like this everybody sees what we humans do to our planet and to our oceans!!"
Brookeellar,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2017,I knew the beaches in Seminyak weren't going to be anything like our Australian beaches but I didn't realise how filthy it would actually be. I didn't want to walk along the beach let alone swim. Rubbish everywhere. Just filthy 
_d_mostyn,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,its a must to enjoy Beef Rendang & cocktails the beach at sunset & watching those amazing balinese musicians & singers with their incredible soulful voices  under the bright colourful beach umbrellas & colourful bean bag chairs is one of my fav memories of bali
Vesana83,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Dec 2016,"Beach is very nice, full of bars and restaurant.View is just great, if you want to spend nice time, just don't miss to visit.Sunset is just stunning!"
John M,"Parkland, FL",Jan 2017,Water brown & very dirty. Sand is also brown & full of trash. Trash & debris everywhere. You walk & then need a bath/shower to clean up. No swimming-surf too rough.
AAlnazawi,18 contributions,Jan 2017,What made me sad is the amount of trash along the beach but the great thing is from this beach I saw the most amazing sunset in my whole life !!! 
John T,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,I realise it is the wet season but the amout of rubbish on the beach is disgusting. The quality of the water was terrible to say the least
Nick G,15 contributions,Jan 2017,It's shameful how much rubbish we tourists create and sadly the beach is where we see it at its worstMaybe a small levy on each tourist to pay for beach cleaning equipment
Magnificent2014,"Rome, Italy",Dec 2016,Lots of rubbish washing up on the beach but there are many people employed on the beach raking it up and then it is transferred to trucks and taken away.
Giovanni G,"Florianopolis, SC",Jan 2017,"Given, we do travel a lot. But this is, by far, the ugliest beach I ever saw. Yellow sand (not white as some say, or you have to be totally wasted), dirty (plastic) everywhere, beach 'bars' not taken care of, all playing their own music at the same time, etc. By far the worst beach experience ever. "
Antonis S,Qatar,Jan 2017,The setting is really nice!If you plan to see the sunset at any of the cafe-bars along the beach you should go there 2 hours earlier at the busy caffes.Very lay down!
Tia R,"Ballarat, Australia",Jan 2017,It definitely is a shame to see a beach absolutely littered with rubbish. I did hear that this is what happens every year around New Years. I suppose I'm a bit prim and proper considering Australian beaches are absolutely pristine! I think it just threw me back a little and made me appreciate where I live. Sunsets are amazing here however can't seem to take eyes away from the dirt coloured sand and rubbish that is scattered everywhere :(
kellyw0man,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Seminack Bali. Can be busy but if you go outside of school holidays it's not to bad.Check that you have good accomodation we prefere to stay in a private villa as it's nice to have the privacy with your own pool and so on. The restaurants have improve immensely lots of wonderful Australian chefs are now running them and offering fabulous fresh heathy food , you can even get a great cup of coffee. "
Lucy D,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"We recently stayed in Seminyak for 2 days and had just a few short steps to walk down to the beach. Unfortunately, the tide had brought in a lot of rubbish and there was hardly anyone in the water.We were told that the beach is cleaned every morning, but when the tide comes in, so does all the rubbish :(My best advice would be to got to the beach early in the morning, just after it has been cleaned."
Marylouise C,"Diamond Creek, Australia",Jan 2017,The beaches all along this strip from Kuta to Seminyak need a thorough clean up.  The standard is very low.  It seems that all the rubbish that has no where else to go ends up on the shore line & menas plastic and all sorts of debris go into the beautiful sea - such a shame.  This really lets the whole place down.
sarahrosemayer,"Encinitas, CA",Jan 2017,"I was excited to be able to walk to the beach from our hotel, but sadly when we arrived it was covered in trash. There was no clean space, we walked for maybe 15 minutes and found no solace from the trash, even used syringes. It's sad that Seminyak cannot keep its beaches clean."
Gaurav B,11 contributions,Jan 2017,Good beach with lots to do. Be sure to be careful with small kids as water is fast. Though kids enjoy a loy.
coraliekengen,"Paris, France",Jan 2017,"heaven beach with turquoize ocean, white sand and friendly balinese, really love it! Also great for surfing"
RoundTheWorld38,calgary,Jan 2017,"I've been around the world and been to many beaches in many countries both poor and rich.  This is by far the most disgusting, upsetting and disturbing thing I have ever seen.  The beach is literally covered in garbage.  Swimming in the ocean there is garbage floating everywhere.  You should not come out of the ocean with a plastic bag wrapped around your foot, cigarette packages, yogurt containers, you name it.  Apparently it's all coming from Java the main island, but I've been told it's been happening for a long time.  Honestly it is very upsetting.  Don't come here unless you're happy to stay in your hotel at the pool  If you're a beach person avoid at all costs.  Go literally anywhere else."
Rachel R,"Port Stephens, Australia",Dec 2016,"I arrived on 27/12 and this was my first trip to Bali. The beach was filled with rubbish, which I learnt soon enough happens every year in Seminyak. The sand was the colour of dirt - not very enticing to lay a towel on! It was a shame that the hotel I stayed in employed guys to ""clean up"" the rubbish, but this literaly involved pushing the stuff further up the beach, either out of view of the hotel guests, or just far enough so that when the tide came in, it took the rubbish back out into the sea! Really disappointing that this hasn't been dealt with considering it happens every year."
Bruno Wolf,"Villefranche-sur-Mer, France",Jan 2017,"I was in Seminyak in the winter 2014 and was already shocked then by the incredibly dirty beach and ocean. The sewage is running straight into the sea on various points along the beach. This has not changed at all from my first visit. The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!! Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror. We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time. I wish that Bali takes this step too otherwise it will be a lost paradise !"
davorow,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,post NYE this beach is disgusting. rubbish just sits there all over the beach...some places it was hard to see sand.
Krev10,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2017,Watched a live band and the sun set one night here and it was such a great experience. The beach gets insanely packed at night with everyone coming to watch. There are tonnes of bean bags and cushions in front of the beach bars and cafe's and you can order drinks and food while you're there.  
rubberpinata,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Filthy beach with an eye-popping amount of debris that went as far as the eye can see. We paid for beach chairs (IDR 100,000 for a pair of them after bargaining!), then though of running into the sea when we got too hot, then changed our minds when we saw the sheer amount of rubbish and sewage around. We were all too happy to get out after that."
John H,"Joondanna, Australia",Jan 2017,So sad to see rubbish everywhere on the beach. It needs a good clean up and some sort of policing on people littering. 
Yelena,"Turin, Italy",Jan 2017,I had to wash my feet three times after visiting that beach. The sensation of the powerful ocean waves washing trash over your body is deeply disturbing. And it's trash that you can see has been there for months. This sight will turn you into an environmentalist.
Alan F,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"Family friendly, very crowded- I myself love crowded places, with live music! Sunset views are fantastic! The beach is pretty clean, nice to walk in the shore. "
Steve T,3 contributions,May 2016,"No hawkers, just locals enjoying martial arts and soccer at sundown.  Worth the visit. especially at sunset.  try the fresh grilled chicken on the way in. "
AzzaJP,"London, UK",Jan 2017,"Not a place you would want to spend the day for sure, seems a bit grubby and there is a lot of rubbish - wave and big and powerful so good for surfing but maybe not families.If you do want to go to the beach walk along and to a part of the beach in-front of the posh hotels as it seems they pay people to clean up those sections.not really the paradise beach you hear about"
Mark H,"Enmore, Australia",Jan 2017,"Appalling place. Our second visit & we hoped it was cleaned up, but it's worse. Kilometres of beach covered in plastic bottles & rubbish. We went in the water - full of sewerage & other rubbish, it'd be dangerous to your health to swim in it. The locals don't seem to care & they blame the tourist boats but don't even clean it. What should be a beautiful place is far from it.It's a sad example of rampant development & apathy. We'll never go to Bali again. It's ruined."
ju7iet,"Hampton, Australia",Dec 2016,Great for listening to music and drinking by the beach sitting on bean bags...not really good for young family though.
Helena S,Germany,Jan 2017,"We chose Seminyak for our honeymoon stay as it supposed to be one of the best beaches on Bali, but were very much disappointed to say the least. We met only pollution with plastic, huge mountains of rubbish on and next to the beach about which locals say it comes from China. Also it is very crowded and very loud. In June 2016 most of the time swimming was prohibited due to huge waves and every 100m stinky sewage water was led into the ocean. It is a tragedy that the awareness about the unbelievable environmental damage is that little..."
Grantwatson777,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2017,It's an ok beach but Kuta and Legian are much better. There is a big undertow which puts so much sand in the water. There were some good sets of waves so the surfers might like it. There is a good little bar 707 in the batubelig area that is worth a beer after a swim or surf
Zugaro,39 contributions,Jan 2017,Great for dinner on the beach you can eat relax and listen to live music . Sunset was pretty. Don't swim here the beach is dirty !!
david d,"Bangkok, Thailand",Dec 2016,"Beach loungers are beanbags. they leak. Millions of pellets everywhere, and beach bands set too close together so you hear two bands at once. This isn't celebrating sunset...it's celebrating idiocy."
Tau S,"Hyderabad, India",Jun 2016,"When we planned our trip that beachs in bali would be like the once in Thailand, nice, blue, calm. However when we arrived here we realized that its not the same. If you are someone, who enjoys the beach.and don't use that term loosely, I do mean the beach and not a beach side resort, then think again, the waves are very loud and the shore is choppy. You can't even sit on the beach cause sand gets so hot that you'll burn your self. Very disappointed."
Deepak Azad,"New Delhi, India",Oct 2016,"Nice clean and happening beach. specially during sunsets it become pretty happening with beach goers, music, drinks. nice fun overall."
EricaB1326,"Chicago, IL",Jan 2017,If you want a feel for night club life and people hustling you then this is your place. The beach was so littered we were walking through an area where the water was brown and frothy. Rivers from the town empty into this beach area and you have to walk through the filth even if you are just trying to walk along the beach. It's sad how much garbage we saw. No one seemed to care either. 
norto22,"Noosaville, Australia",Jan 2017,"Antons bar and Andre ,what a great bunch of young trustworthy gentlemen, you can leave all your belongings with them safely and enjoy many beverages..there is a young man named Putra who works in bar next door Auzzie bar who is a must to see as well ,rips up the beach breaks on 66 with his phantom surf board . "
Jacqui C,7 contributions,Jan 2017,Rubbish in the water makes this side of Bali a very sorry sight. People from the sunset clubs on the beach leave there rubbish behind and then you find yourself swimming in the ocean with hundreds of plastic bottles and rubbish. Stick to your pool side resorts!!!
Kelly C,4 contributions,Jan 2017,"Don't expect an idyllic, white sand beach....this isn't it. I know I am spoiled by the beaches in Australia but there is a huge problem with rubbish. There's piles of it everywhere and when I was surfing I was surfing with so much plastic and rubbish. However, the beach bars are nice - very cheap and you get to hang out with locals. The sunsets are spectacular and I highly recommend some beers on the beach at the bars at sunset."
anne J,Sydney,Jan 2017,We had a drink on the bean bags on the beach. The sand and water is very dirty. Nice sunset and interesting characters but didn't feel the need to visit again. 
gkaytrips,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"its quite long, beautiful at any time of the day but specially at sunset, its you and the beach, all other noises just disappear"
Fiona S,"Bargara, Australia",Jan 2017,"Loved Bali but WTF, the beach is absolutely and utterly disgusting. Swimming would definitely constitute a health hazard, that is if you don't get tangled up in some of the debris. Unless the Indonesian government takes radical action, nobody will go there."
navpreet k,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,"A good beach .. i spent most of my evenings here as during the day shore was littered and was very annoying to see it like that.During dusk, the restaurants come to life., you can easily spend long time eating, drinking bintang and gazing the sun. personally i preffered seminyak area and beach over Kuta.."
Linda L,Sydney,Dec 2016,When Seminyak Beach has been cleaned of storm or rainy season debris it is a great beach to relax and swim.If you require shade and in the Balinese heat it is advisable be prepared to pay 100 000IDR for a umbrella and lounge.
Mark S,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,"During the day the beach is disgusting.Night time not so bad as you don't get to see the filth right along the entire beach. The water is like a cesspool,I certainly wouldn't swim in it."
19Lisa77,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,When we visited there was no rubbish like there was at beaches at Legian and Kuta. Also nobody bugging you to buy stuff which was a bonus.
aghr2017,"Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Russia",Dec 2016,"Very dirty, a lot of garbage coming from the sea and Java island make this beach entirely unattractive place to visit."
Soniasla,"Ilminster, UK",Dec 2016,"Such a shame that fellow travellers don't put their rubbish in the beach , they have ruined this beach ."
Darren J,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Jan 2017,"Xmas/wet season is not the time to stay in Seminyak. The beaches in this area are covered in rubbish that washes up every tide this time of year. We've been here for 3 weeks over Xmas/NY and haven't spent any time on the beaches, it's that bad. You'd be better off staying on the eastern side, Sanur area. Nice beaches, clear water."
Biz N,17 contributions,Jul 2016,Hello Future Bali Traveler !   trip of a lifetime.  The waves the people the sand and the surf. Amazing time.  don't miss this.  
Alan M,"Millbrae, CA",Dec 2016,"We are pretty spoiled in Australia & New Zealand for the cleaniness of our beaches. Unfortunately, the beaches we went to in Seminyak were full of rubbish & a bit smelly in places. Really takes away from the experience. However, we did enjoy a nice sunset which was lovely, and the photos couldn't pick up the rubbish!"
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Good beach with a number of nice hotels but not really suitable for swimming due to strong current and unpredictable waves...
_swiss_miss_hi,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2016,"Going in November I thought it would be busy, but I was wrong.  It was really the best time to go - water was perfect and the beach not busy.  Highly recommend it!"
Travel 💫,"Saint Louis, MO",Dec 2016,"The seminyak beach is a local beach not a private one, lacks basic cleanliness.The water is very dirty filled with plastic bottles and caps and other junk.Please visit private beaches adjoining the resorts instead.The water temperature was warm for December."
FamilyTravelJunkkie,"Wahroonga, Australia",Jan 2017,By far the most polluted beach I have ever seen.  Definitely not good for swimming.  The shopping and restaurants are awesome but stay in your pool
Littleswon,"Lake Forest, CA",Dec 2016,Everything was overly priced and you constantly have to haggle with the sellers.  Food was over priced on the beach and it was VERY VERY dirty.  I didn't want to even take off my shoe in case I catch something.
Molly L,18 contributions,Jan 2017,The beach is very disappointing... obviously polluted with tons of rubbish along the beach. Sunsets are the only saving grace!
Yvettejj,"Bendigo, Australia",Dec 2016,"I have seen Seminyak Beach during the dry and its beautiful but unfortunately on our last trip during the wet season it was sad to see so much rubbish on the beach. Yes, great for sunsets but so is Sanur and Jimbaran without the rubbish. I wouldn't take kids here during the wet season too much rubbish. Something needs to be done to improve this as many traders are loosing business as people don't want to be there."
KathynGreg W,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2017,We were told recent storms was the cause of the rubbish all overthe beach. Pretty sad for local business owners as it definitely turned tourists off  being at the beach. Local workers  constantly cleaning the beach but was hard for them to keep up with the  rubbish  rolling in
Natalie W,27 contributions,Feb 2016,"You will find lots of upscale bars and restaurants. Take a taxi at night, as there are stray dogs that become quite aggressive in the later hours. Taxis are cheap and worth avoiding the hassle. People are friendly and nice here. "
Nikki B,32 contributions,Jan 2017,"So sad about the beach, full of rubbish. Sharing images only because it's such a beautiful place and needs some attention. We had a great time in Bali and Gilli T. Did not spend much time on Seminyak beach for this reason, such a great place to visit still. Hope this was due to bad weather but either way more plastic free alternatives need to be in place for hotels and restaurants to keep this rubbish free, help the environment and tourism economy flowing. "
Kristall88,"Olching, Germany",Dec 2016,"The beach in Seminjak has collapsed into Inge of the worst place in the world.  In front of Hotel Puri Saron they Place Küssens in the sand beginning 3pm until midnight for a drink to watch the sunset. The mushers now reach the waterlevel. Every few meters there is terribly loud Musik from speakers, each Musik different!! I have been coming to Bali may, many time-I loved the island, but now this is a nightmare. Only money,money,money counts!Bye,bye Bali- me no more!!!"
PeggyArchie,"Thames Ditton, UK",Jan 2017,"Lovely beach, although expect to see a lot litter which unfortunately washes up from other islands 🌴 "
Braden B,13 contributions,Jan 2017,"We came in January, and I read that there was a lot of trash on the west coast of Bali at this time, but I thought people were being dramatic. They weren't kidding. It might have been one of the dirtiest beaches I have ever been to. And it is a black sad beach (along with most of the west coast). When I heard this, I was thinking it would be like the Hawaiian black sand beaches, and I was excited. It was nothing like that. It just looked dirty. It is still soft sand though. The waves are great for surfing all year round though!"
Maurice W,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"This beach is out the back of the hotel we are staying in, and I must say the sunsets are superb but the beach itself is nothing to write home about lots of rubbish and people,in the evening they set up bean bags on the beach so you can chill out and watch the sunset with the obligatory drink if your into that stuff?"
Zibergdi,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2016,very dirty from the blown in rubbish. wouldn't not recommend as a relaxing beach to hang out at. very different from Australia's clean beaches
ApurvGarg,"Noida, India",Jan 2017,Dirty beachGuys get the authorities to start the cleaning process Ugly dorky beach ! Not for sun loungers Many restaurants and each clubs located on it 
Anna C,6 contributions,Jan 2017,Waste waste waste. One of  the most disgusting place i've ever seen. Sorry to lost part of my holiday in this place ( we fortunately escape to Nusa Dua )
Jen N Brett S,"Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia",Jan 2017,Grt area. Went there too take photos of sunset. Beach abit dirty.  Lots of ppl.  Bit dark walking area there. Lots of scooters.  Amazing restaurants 
nickyb337,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"Lots of rubbish and debris, too many sellers. quite a few restaurants along the beach and quite reasonable. two sunloungers were 200,000 "
t2lae,"Richmond, Australia",Jan 2017,"Super dirty with rubbish everywhere from used needles, plastic to you name it. The sand is black and the waves are just crashing into shore with more rubbish. Full of Aussie bogans drinking and sun baking on the dirtiest beach I have seen. Just purely tourist girly bars and cheap tourist trapped shops.Not worth visiting. There's other better beaches in Bali. "
Robert H,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2017,We went in New Year's Day so they were prob suffering from the night before. But it looked like a rubbish dump and I couldn't see anyone trying to clean it. The sand was brown and a bit grainy. I wouldn't go back unless I was on a surf trip.
Mokkey8,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,"I'm glad I didn't choose a hotel by this beach as it was horrendous. It was like a rubbish dump with piles of trash which had yet to be cleared and more rubbish being washed up.I was told by a local that at this time of year, the winds and the tides bring in all the rubbish. Better beaches to be found at Nusa Dua during this period of the year.I assume the higher ratings were when reviewers were visiting during other months.Definitely do not recommend visiting this 'beach' now."
priyanka2,"London, UK",Jan 2017,When u see a sunset in this place u realise that best things in life do come free!!!Gorgeous place. Not crowded ! U shud try and be there around sunset and see god paint the sky! 
Anne_Aalborg,"Aalborg, Denmark",Jan 2017,The beach is wide and the waves are good fun. Unfortunately the beach is very dirty. The locals and the hotels do their very Best to keep it clean but still there is plastic floating around in the water and is washed up on shore.The prices for sunbeds are way to high and the dealers are somewhat arrogant.I wouldn't go here again.
Wildovertravel,18 contributions,Jan 2017,Seminyak's beaches close to the hotels are extremely dirty and thus I was very disappointed. I don't believe it's worth paying extra to be close to the beach. 
Alana K,72 contributions,Dec 2016,"In december because of all the storms there is rubbish all over the beach and the water is brown. In june and july the water was clear and no rubbish on the beach. I would recommend going to Seminyak just not the main beach, there are many small beaches to go too that would replace the main one."
Duncan E,"Elgin, Scotland, United Kingdom",Dec 2016,"If this is the beach by potato head then it resembles a land fill site, rubbish strewn everywhere, broken furniture etc.Simply the worst beach in an area promoting tourism that I have ever been to."
ankkit9,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,Water is kinda black. You have massage therapist annoying u with their offers. Shacks r expensive for God known reasons. You get serious sunburns in this beach even when sun was not so shinyBetter book a villa and relax there.
TWEEDY5,"Plymouth, UK",Dec 2016,"We walked down to Seminyak beach through dirty streets, loose dogs and motor bikes driving on the pavements! When we arrived at the beach all we could see was a carpet of rubbish! Nobody attempting to clear it up. It's just everywhere and it stinks. Sanitary items, needles and general crap. As we walked further along the beach it got worse. We have been to many beaches in many different countries,  this is by far the worst. Paradise LOST."
Timothy,"Boras, Sweden",Dec 2016,"this beach is a nice place but would be better if it was cleaned more often. there is a lot of trash that washed up on shore, especially after a storm. "
Mark H,39 contributions,Nov 2016,"You have to go to the beach when your in Seminyak but don't expect much.The sand is average, the waves are average and the beach itself is very dirty. It is crowded with chairs, bean bags, noise from bars right on the beach. You have to go and have a look but there are better things to do and don't build a whole day around it. "
lynette291,"Pretoria, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Beaches of Cuta and Seminyak are totally unswimmable due to the filth and debris in the water. Disgusting objects are everywhere and this area should be avoided. The beach vendors are a huge bother and the constant harrasment drives one up the wall - some even become aggressive if you ignore them! All in all, Bali was a complete dissapointment and the traffic is unbearble."
ClaireBlueMountains,"Wentworth Falls, Australia",Dec 2016,We entered the beach at KuDeTa. It looked like this point was where beach rubbish was collected. It was great to see a rubbish removal system in place and dedicated workers collecting and removing rubbish and I am very aware that the rubbish they were collecting was doe to tourism and possibly bad weather so I am certainly not apportioning any blame however I would not go swimming as the water was visibly dirty and the sand was dirty as well. I am sorry Bali that our love of the island is the very thing causing the island to lose its feel of Paradise.
dianepalma,"London, UK",Dec 2016,Not sure whether due to a rare weather condition or not but the beach is very windy all day! The sand gets all over our face and eyes! Lucky my 3yo and I wear our sunnies so it helps us to see a bit clear.  We made sand castle but the beach is so dirty that we only spent 15-20mins there. There is no shower facility to clean up too. Not sure why this beach is popular but I guess not for little ones. Or maybe I chose the wrong area of the beach. Won't be coming back.
Nelsam854,"Washington DC, DC",Dec 2016,Trash everywhere! From far it looked so beautiful until getting closer where you literally see trash EVERYWHERE!!! 
John_useridtaken,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Per the title, the beach was covered in winblown rubbish and driftwood. Nothing redeeming. Suggest going to one of the beach side clubs instead"
skat66,"Caulfield, Australia",Dec 2016,"Went to Seminyak and stayed at the RoyaB Beach for a week. The beach was a disgrace covered in filth and apart from a couple of hotels trying but losing, there was no pick up of the piles of stinking garbage mounting up on the beach.  I have never seen a beach that was so trashed and no one seemed to care."
TonyPoor,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,we went down to the beach area restaurants to meet up with friends for dinner and there are loads of eating areas with great food.took a beachfront walk to friends hotel and the beach is probably the most littered beach i have ever walked along. you could not help but not to walk on plastic drink containers. worst beach around i cannot see how the people could be proud of this area absolutely a disgrace.
Jets3tt5r11,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,Arrived In Seminyak hoping to visit the beach area. Noticed large amounts of rubbish spread everywhere. Not appealing at all. Once of the dirties beaches I have come across. The locals make an effort to clean it up but it's really bad!
Subbu N,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2016,It was a huge disappointment to see this beach lined by plastics and garbage all along the shoreline.A complete eye sore!
Paul R,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2016,Stayed in Seminyak for 7 nights and loved the restaurants on offer - all cuisines. Walked the beach every day and enjoyed the early morning tranquility. Had a sunset evening at Potato Head by the beach and this is a must do.
Princess_Ronna,"Xi'an, China",Dec 2016,The beach was really clean even with the past storms that had happened.  They had cleaned it up nicely!  The sand was nice between my toes and the Beach was really happening.  There are a lot of lovely restaurants around this area and an easy walk from my hotel.
kteecee,"Cebu City, Philippines",Jun 2016,This was the beach closest to us. It's pretty crowded. I can see why some people would call it dirty with all the tourists around. I'm sure Bali can offer you better beaches. Not really a must see.
caring247,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"We were shocked at the amount of plastic and rubbish that is washed up on the beach in front of our accomodation in Seminyak. It looked like a land fill tip site. Every day teams of locals trawl through the rubbish sorting organic waste from plastic, chopping up driftwood the size of tree trunks with chainsaws and bagging up rubbish in plastic bin liners, piling it up on the sand dunes, only for it to be washed back into the ocean at high tide. I can't believe the hotels along the beach don't help with the rubbish removal.  Time for big business to make a stand and say NO to plastic and commit to cleaning up this beach for the sake of the locals who rely on tourism for their livelihood. I won't be coming back to Seminyak."
Tahlia C,40 contributions,Dec 2016,Seminyak beach is lovely at sunset however any other time of the day it is quite busy and basically just another beach in Bali. It is pretty dirty and quite busy with tourists. 
Alyanna H,"General Santos, Philippines",Dec 2016,"Went here as soon as I arrived in Seminyak and it's probably one of the most dirtiest beaches I've ever seen in my life. I had a surfing lesson and the waves were good, but every now and then you get caught in rubbish. Most of it comes from the sea, apparently mostly from Java (at least, that's what our surfing instructors told us). It's good to see the local people making an effort to clean it up though. The sunset is quite pretty as well if you try and overlook the rubbish along the shore."
zen008,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Not sure if it is the time of the year but it was full of rubbish, plastic bottles and not appealing at all..... Preferably head to nusa dua for the white sand clean beaches. "
Mollymoo_10,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2016,"The beach is terrible there is rubbish all over it, Stay by your pool much better idea and you don't have to put up with the touts."
Michael S,"Geelong, Australia",Dec 2016,Dirty and full of rubbish. Do not swim as storm water and sewage would be of concern. Very quiet when we were there as l guess people didn't want to risk it. Lots of lounge seats to hire with water buckets at the end to clean your feet. Massages also offered. 
KDoozy,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"What a disgrace. We should all feel guilty as we are all responsible for it. Rubbish as far as the eye can see. Mostly plastics and mostly food-related, eg. straws, yoghurt pouches, bags. It is unfathomable how businesses like Potato Head and Ku De Ta survive surrounded by such filth. If I had booked a holiday at a beachside resort in the expectation that I'd be lying on the beach and swimming in the sea every day, I'd be devastated. This poor planet of ours is slowly choking to death and Seminyak Beach is evidence of that..."
anjie27,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,Full of rubbish. No fun for little children looking to play in the sand. Do not suggest going there unless you've heard about a massive clean up.  Jimbaran and other beaches are probably better. 
Helen S,"Greater Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"I have never seen the beach so dirty, kudos to the Balinese for trying to keep it clean but the water is loaded with plastic, paper and wood. Sad"
Rachel J,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"It's quite upsetting that the beach was filled with trash. EVEN WHEN YOU'RE SWIMMING IN THE SEA! They're literally everywhere. The only upside there was the ambience, & my pizza was good. It gets crowded but you can still find a private spot. "
I_S_B_L,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,I went there to catch the sunset & it was awesome. The waves were huge and strong. It was incredibly windy.
valechuchu,"Montevideo, Uruguay",Dec 2016,"I don't know if it was the time of the year or if it is always like this nowadays, but the astonishing quantities of dirt and rubbish, piling up in mountains in the beach is totally disappointing to say the least. Seminyak is the first spot we hit on Bali once we arrived to our honeymoon. It is so sad to see the ocean and the waves carrying such amazing quantities of rubbish. We took a taxi and went to sanur, were it was much better..."
Vinayak S,178 contributions,Oct 2016,"The view at the beach is really great, no hindrance and no mess. You can enjoy a full day out at this place and can soak in the calmness of colorful sunset."
Saud,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"Compare it to Kuta beach, I noticed that Kuta beach is much cleaner, maybe because when I went there it was windy. "
Sep3ani,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2016,Seminyak beach is one of many beach to go in Bali. Many restaurant near the beach. You can enjoy afternoon and evening on Seminyak beach. Don't forget to playing kite there
Niels L,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Dec 2016,Owners in the area really need to do something about regular cleaning of the beach if the autorities are idle. This lovely beach us much less attracting to visitors if it is not cleaned daily.
Aravind K,2 contributions,Nov 2016,The view is extraordinary. A mountain close to the beach is always beautiful. Beach gives a beautiful view of the sunset. A calm and serene location with a lot of cafes on the edge of the beach allows us to take a good view of the sunset and enjoy the drinks
Majid J,"Stockholm, Sweden",Dec 2016,"Rainy season, all the trash just goes down to the sea during heavy rain. Also some sewer water goes right into the ocean. I don't recommend this beach. "
MGDevi,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"watch sunset almost every weekend here, sometimes its crowd, sometimes not. many family with puppy or strangers and tourist for afternoon walk. sometimes visit this beach after sunset for a nice pictures"
Joseph C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,"Bringing high expectation, me and my family with 2 young ones were quickly disappointed when we arrived. The whole beach was filled with litters. The sand wasn't smooth for children. The wave was huge and dangerous for children. Overall, it may be only good for jogging."
Reza P,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"nice beach to hang out,, great sunset.Make sure bring all you need if you want to hang out there..."
Alex4sport,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Dec 2016,"No so populate as Kuta with surfers, as Nusa Dua with russian swimmers.  Nice place to relax and view sunset. The waves are big, and a lot of garbage are thrown on the beach from the ocean, but thats common issue for whole Bali. You mostly can't swim here, but you can experience the waves hitting you :)Seminyak itself is the best place for eat and drink and party. Enjoy!"
PearlySim,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"Been to Bali many times and this is my saddest visit.   Washed up on the entire stretch of the shore (Kuta beach, Legian beach and Seminyak beach) are trash.  Trash dumped by humans from Indonesia's mainland and now washed up on the once lovely beaches of Bali.One can't even walk out through the whitewash or paddle out without having plastic bags, ropes or strings wrapped around one's legs or arms. Plastic wrappers, condom wrappers and bottles are amidst some of the trash dumped and washed up.  It's too much trash to list them. Let the photos speak for the once beautiful beaches of Bali.  I'm very saddened to see how we humans have failed to love Mother Nature."
aanaca,1 contribution,Dec 2016,"Must visit this beach while in Seminyak area, lill bit crowded in the afternoon by family and local. But its fine."
Jacqueline G,"Whanganui, New Zealand",Oct 2016,"I love Seminyak beach!! It's always lovely to walk along and is looked after and rubbish cleaned away every morning. You can sit and relax on a deck chair, have a swim or surf and then a cool relaxing drink at sunset at one of the friendly beach bars"
Lynne K,"Mackay, Australia",Dec 2016,"Full of rubbish disgusting filth, save your time and money. Would be just as clean going to dump in Australia "
Fcogayan,"Santiago, Chile",Nov 2016,"This place is the restaurant of GrandMas, so we try almost everything (we spend almost 15 days)The food was really great, always good service and chilled live acoustic music in the afternoons We suggest to try the breaks fasts and tapas. I think is good price for the food, but there is different places to eat for the same money, so you have to choose. I recommend some tapas and beer in the afternoonEnjoy"
Neil W,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Like the rest of the beaches on this stretch it is diety and has heaps of rubbish at this time of year. Good to walk along at low tide though. 
sharon s,"Las Vegas, NV",Dec 2016,"This beach is much more quieter than others.  Which makes it much more pleasant.  They have lounge and umbrella rentals for those wanting a lazy day at the beach. Take a taxi here.  It's not far from seminyak square, but the roads are a killer for pedestrians.  Taxi is cheap.  Ask driver first.  Some will try and rip you off.  Although they are still cheap too. "
Carjam123,"Manawatu-Wanganui Region, New Zealand",Apr 2016,"Avoid - unless you are a beer swilling night club loving person with no appreciation for the environment. The food options are great is the only plus. Narrow congested streets, like Asian Benidorm - a Mecca for the crass and tasteless "
Antipodean,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Nice beach with warm water and grey (not white) sand. Lots of tourists and locals enjoying the day and watching the sun set. Locals selling kites and necklaces with out too much hassle. It is not as good as white sand beaches of many countries but how can you complain when the water is warm and the sun is setting with a nice cooling breeze as the sun sets. 
Karin,15 contributions,Dec 2016,"The beach has black sand and some fair waves that i saw quite some people surfing. It is not that crowded in the morning, but it gets super full and colorful nearing sunset. The beach was filthy in the early morning, mostly rubbish from the previous night (it gets pretty festive), but they clean it daily until it is fairly clean."
KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Why are there so many people at this filthy cesspit of a beach? It's really not worth wasting your time here. Rubbish everywhere. 
Heidi3205,"St Kilda, Australia",Dec 2016,"It could have been the worst day of the year to arrive but Seminyak beach was a mess of rubbish, black dirty sand, fowl smells and more rubbish washing in from the sea and from the open sewer / drain / creek that opens onto the beach beside the Royal Beach Seminyak resort. Apparently this happens during the wet season.  We retreated to Sanur where the beach is pristine - but no surf. "
JoeCool_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,"We normally stay at Seminyak as we like the shops and restaurants around this area.  However, the beaches in Seminyak are mainly black sand beaches and is not quite what you would expect if you are more used to white sand beaches.  As such we do not normally spend time at the beach here or swim in the sea if we come to seminyak.  If your preference is for white sand beaches, then Nusa Dua may be more your cup of tea.Being in the west part of Bali, the beaches here do offer good sunsets in the evenings."
Ali202,"Noosa, Australia",Dec 2016,We had in our heads that we would be down the beach all the time .. unfortunately the beach was so full of rubbish in and out of the water that the only swimming we did was at our pool in the villa .. disgraceful that it is a tourist destination and there is so much plastic and rubbish everywhere !!!!! Yuck
Michel1965,Zürich,Dec 2016,"We went all around Bali, the beaches in Seminyak are large and long. Many beach clubs where you can or must rent beds. Water seams fair. The sand has not the loved white colours but a classic brown as you find by us in construction. Nothing is perfekt but sure nice"
SazzadHossain,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Dec 2016,Its a quite beach with some bar and less beach activities because of most of tourist stays here with a private villa. But the sunrise and sunset from this beach is excellent.
geraldine157,"Hobart, Australia",Dec 2016,Do yourself a favor and give this  beach and miss  there are great beachside in other parts of the island 
bagusprawitra,"Bandung, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"Seminyak beach is one of my favorite beach, it's near my fav beach front cafe like la plancha and the champlung, my friends and me enjoy every sunset over there with the bottle of beers, so come and try the beach ✌😎🌊🌅"
Arthidxb,Dubai,Dec 2016,Enjoyed the breeze and some time with the family on the beach. Not too crowded. Occasional street hawkers passing by.
RobertaBertone,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is absolutely gorgeous, especially at sunset!I did not get a chance to go swimming, but there is a great vibe all around, lots of people and venues to have fun at!"
Maria Z,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2016,"A difficult one to score beacuse on the one hand to sit on the sand and swim in the water of Seminyak beach is quite terrible. The dark sand and unpleasant surf  (can be dangerous) is not really conducive to playful and enjoyable frolicking. Indeed the lack of swimmers most of the time is a testament to the less than ideal conditions. Additionally like most beaches in Bali dumping of rubbish is normal as is the vast amount of influx of rubbish from Java (affecting West coast) . Add to that the fact that dogs roam freely and you get the gist. On the other hand the beaches are what makes Bali Bali. Seminyak  is where you can see the most beautiful sunsets, the view from the various eateries all along Seminyak beach is colourful with various vendors selling their wears. From colourful kites to an array of nic naks, So many colourful bean hags along the beach as you get closer to double six and virtually hundreds of colourful umbrellas at the Southern end make the beach transform from an 'ugly duckling' to a beautiful 'swan'"
John P,"Tairua, New Zealand",Dec 2016,"Beautifully warm surf; comfortable loungers available for hire, with bar service provided.  Only complaint was the high level of wrapper, bags and similar trash in the water. "
Patrick L,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,"Seminyak!A shoppers and gourmet paradise here in Bali but when the heat hits you and you just need some respite from all that heat, buy some swim wear if you didn't pack it and head for the beach just parallel to the shopping strip.The water is warm and the breeze cool and that makes for a perfect combination to cool off.There are ample places for internal refreshments too; water, beer, cocktails and food galore."
Bev w,"Tallahassee, FL",Nov 2016,"Lots efforts to keep the beach picked up by the community were evident, but it was still pretty trashy.  I was reluctant to get in the water after a first day walk on the beach that took us through several stinky washes.  I enjoyed my visit to Bali and we had great accommodations with very good food, but the beach up close was a disappointment.  When veiwed from a distance it was beautiful the surf was aqua and the wave action was impressive.  I thought the grey sand with evidence of the volcanic geography was unique, but smell and trash are hard to ignore.  There must be better beaches than Seminyak. It was the most disappointing part of my visit."
hannah g,"Wollongong, Australia",Dec 2016,"Beautiful spot, lots of those beach sunbeds to hire for the day to avoid sitting on the sand. It's super relaxing and tons of restaurants and bars line the sand so perfect to slip away for a bite to eat too. Beware though, you will be approached by a lot of locals trying to sell their products to you throughout the day.. Then again, you are in Bali! "
Jess H,13 contributions,Dec 2016,"Lots and lots of rubbish and bamboo on this beach. Sand is kinda black and the water that is coming from the town into the beach smells. We walked the length and didn't feel like stopping anywhere, I guess you don't go to Seminyak for the beach! "
poly_only,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2016,the beach is much more cleaner than kuta beach..one of my favourite spot to catch sunset...try to grab your favorite drinks in one of the beach bar there :) worth :)
Tania K,"Somerset, England",Dec 2016,"Walked from Seminyak to Kuta along this beach which has something for everyone! Such friendly people offering drinks, sun beds, massage or food."
Jason S,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2016,"Not a bad beach when it's clean. Depending on the weather, can get overrun with rubbish. The locals do their best to clean up each morning."
reindeerchronicles_,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"It was not anything fantastic, but do give it a visit if you have time to spare! Beach is generally clean and good for taking a stroll with your family and friends."
Benn1973,"Kempsey, Australia",Dec 2016,Not as good as most beaches on theeast coast Australia but definitely better then Kuta beach or Nusa dua
Aaron H,67 contributions,Dec 2016,"I would like to come back and learn to surf, the waves looked incredible! You could literally taste the salt from the beach - there were lots of people trying to sell you stuff but they weren't too bad if you just say No politely !"
Pav21K,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2016,"I had visited this beach in the noon, since it was a low season, enjoyed my time here. Clean and white sand beach, excellent choice for surfers. Do visit the beachfront cafes and restaurants for a sunset and great food and drinks."
Prisha N,India,Sep 2016,The place is good for relaxing! In the evening it was set up with a colorful umbrellas in the seaside. 
trahas,"Queensland, Australia",Nov 2016,"Clean beach stretches for miles. Its a beautiful slice of paradise, only down side are the hawkers, but you get them everywhere!"
Kerry S,"Sale, Australia",Dec 2016,"the ocean was great, waves not too rough, comfortable lounge chairs to hire at a vert cheap rate, 2 or 3 food and drink huts close by for refreashments  "
cheeky014,"High Wycombe, Australia",Nov 2016,What a beautiful view of sunset and the beach absolutely gorgeous - very relaxing and comfortable - had a great time
mustanggt08,"Rudolfstetten, Switzerland",Nov 2016,nice place to relax with sandy beach. good for surfing and to have a good time.only a little bit windy
Fifi_Mothei,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Oct 2016,This is the beach to go to when looking for a little excitement. Plenty beachside bars and restaurants to choose from. Lots of people everywhere but the beach is big enough to accommodate everyone. Do hang around even after the sun had gone down for some drinks. 
breejm,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2016,There is so many places to go and sit and eat or drink on Seminyak Beach. I would recommend it mostly for the sunset as it is just divine!!! 
lakshit s,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,"This a chill out beachIt decently clean. I expected  it to be cleaner.You would find a lot of beach cafes with bean bags. You will also find the regular ones.Gra a bean bag shack and chill on a sunset.Enjoy your meal/drink/with your partner.Avoid monsoon, as rain may spoil it a little bit."
Margaret W,"Ashford, UK",Nov 2016,So much space. Beautiful warm water. A must. There are women selling gorgeous sarongs. Perfect for presents.
Greyson622,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"I would not recommend people to go to seminyak beach if you are thinking that it's gonna be all white and clean. December is the raining season, rubbish are being washed up from the other islands to seminyak beach, it's really dirty and most of the time it's raining.I would say the other season will be fine because it seems like a really good place for surfing and tanning."
Melanie R,Siem reap,Dec 2016,"The beach itself is a let down, very few facilities for those wanting to catch the sun, bothered by sellers, no bathrooms or food or drink facilities on the beach but it is cleaned daily"
Barry T,"Warminster, UK",Dec 2016,Litter everywhere. Couldn't believe the amount of rubbish swept ashore. Filthy. Our local landfill is tidier. Just not good enough for any beach let alone a tourist place
Manib81,43 contributions,Dec 2016,This place is lovely as a chill out zone but there are way too many stray dogs running around the beach. It's very lively at night and there is great music which is fantastic! Overall it's not that bad but daytime and nighttime there is a huge contrast 
Marie A,5 contributions,Nov 2016,Great to have dinner on the beach and watch the sunset. Bars and restaurants usually close around 11pm on the beach.
Stephen N,"Kinglake, Australia",Dec 2016,"From our hotel on the beach it was well supervised and clean, people were learning to surf, swimming, walking and jogging. Some locals were trying to sell their flying kits shaped like pirate sailing ships"
roy.47,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,Ten minutes leisurely walk from the Marriott where we were staying. Crowded every evening with people socialising and watching the sun set. 
jlovestotravelandeat,"Lympstone, UK",Nov 2016,"Surf is amazing, so is the beach....apart from that is is so dirty and if there is heavy rain the rubbish from Java gets washed up onto the beach. Even had a plastic bag wrap around my leg in the sea! The beach bars are good but the women sellers are persistent and irritating if you are trying to relax. "
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Drop by at a luxury hotel in Seminyak, me and friend taking a look at this beautiful beach, while the nice weather support the beautiful image of the spot. Some people enjoy the beach by little running along the off-shore, some others were having chats, seen kids were swimming."
NiveditaSamanta,98 contributions,May 2016,"It's nice during the day, we walked from Potato Head to KuDeTa and it was fantastic walk! The hawkers can be pesky, but they go away if you say a firm ""no"". "
SoVerySoCal,"Orange County, CA",Nov 2016,"We visited on a November morning, so our view may be a bit skewed. The beach was clean, clear, and empty. We also stopped by Ku De TA for drinks and again, it was relatively empty. Perfect spot for our last day in Bali."
Rajan1951,"Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, India",Nov 2016,"The beach is clean. There are few good restaurants on the beach, and the food there is clean, tasty and very reasonably priced."
evrywhere,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"The best way to see this beach is from Potato head. Book your chair and watch the sunset. Eat drink and enjoy. The Sundays have many locals enjoying the beach with their families, so nice to see."
Josor24,"Darwin, Australia",Nov 2016,Average kind of beach. Not really a good place to relax being annoyed by someone selking or offering something. Go to Padawa instead
Nicholas P,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Dark coloured sand means it really heats up, so take thongs with you. Get a good spot and the sunsets are truly breathtaking.My biggest criticism is that neither the tourists or the locals respect the area, so much crash just thrown on the sand, cigarette butts etc...very disappointing."
Kit P,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"Long, wide & colourful beach in the evening. Many colourful bean bags laying around the various beach bars. Enjoyed the warm sea breeze & capturing the sunset. Nice place to take pictures.Many mobile hawkers walking to sell sunglasses, sarong, kites, sky lanterns, etc. After the sunset, i saw many ppl lighting up the sky lanterns as well. "
Paul_Leanne_M1,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2016,Great spots to take in the beautiful sunsets lots of good services and beach clubs but not real nice in terms of cleanlyness of sand etc. Leanne & Paul 
Sandy B,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Seminyak beach is ok, nothing to shout about and you definitely wouldn't come here for the beach. You'd be much better off staying at a nice villa or resort with a good pool. The sunsets are beautiful and you can also surf at different places along the beach but you'll find much better places in the world for a beach. "
Simer B,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2016,"Great for surfing and walks along the beach.amazing sunset, accessible from several hotels in seminyak"
Plam P,16 contributions,Nov 2016,Nice endless beach with beautiful beach and view nice to walk swim surf or just sunbathing. Not crowded 
HungoverTT,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",Nov 2016,Unfortunately seminyak beach is the consequences of over development and tourism. Its hard to balance protecting the environment while trying to get as much tourists in as possible.
MerryRosalin,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"Enjoy and relax evening time in Seminyak Beach, feel the ambiance of truly beach... Nice to see the scenery especially in Sunset time, relax and ""me time"""
Izzy M,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Seminyak beach is this huge beautiful stretch of sand with countless spots to stop for a drink or some food while locals come and offer you all sorts of things for sale. I easily visit this area every single day I'm in Bali, because it's got absolutely everything you need"
Richard B,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"some live music and some dance chill out music on the beach, wide selection of people and all age groups also popular for the locals surf is always present and most people do swim in this area"
Jo C,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Nov 2016,I did prefer Seminyak Beach 23 years ago..but more to do for tourists now :) Lots of great places to eat or just watch the sunset.
aussieAl_61,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,"I walked down from my accommodation one evening to the beach.It was wide, clean, and not crowded. I enjoyed watching the setting sun, surfers and people walking by."
Vivian L,492 contributions,Nov 2016,I can just sit all day and night at this beach!  The sunset was magnificent and after that was a starry beautiful night!  Lots of bars with live music and it's so relaxing juat chill at one of them for a nice beer or cocktail! 
Jay W,"Montreal, Canada",Nov 2016,Good place for surfing but not good for swimming. Too wavy. Sand is ok. Good for tanning also. Not crowded. 
LONG CHING L,16 contributions,Dec 2015,"beautiful beachsand softface to west, can see the beautiful sunsettravel date: 2012 DEC"
Lynda149,"Auckland, New Zealand",Nov 2016,"Its a very average beach, there are so many bicep beaches along the coast. The sand isn't that nice and theres a fair bit of rubbish around. Lots of vendors trying to sell you stuff constantly. We wouldn't spend a lot of time here, however a walk along the beach is interesting."
Daniel S,"Sollentuna, Sweden",Nov 2016,This is a great beach with a little bit darker sand because of the volcanos. Along the beach you will find the big expensive hotels where you can go for a drink. The only negative thing is for parents is that the water is pretty dangerous here. Big waves and underwater currents.
Taurus_2011,"Reading, UK",Nov 2016,"If you want a big beach with lots to offer this beach did offer a lot. Restaurants and bars everywhere all the way along, the surf is good especially for beginners and although at sunset the beach seemed very busy there was plenty of space to either walk along or chill out on one of the many beanbags. Overall a nice beach. "
Chester W,"London, UK",Nov 2016,"There are some nice hotels / beach clubs set back from the sea front and the beach is large but lacks the intimacy of beaches in other parts of indonesia, such as in the Gili Islands "
Josh F,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach is beautiful. Water is warm, low tide shows the flat sand covered in a thin layer of water reflecting the sunset, worth staying until after dark for the sky lantern ceremonies! Free parking for scooters along the small beach road and renting a beanbag is free with any food or drink (30,000RPI mei goreng / bin tang) "
Eric F,"Antwerp, Belgium",Nov 2016,One of the best places in Bali to watch the sunset.Ku De Ta and Potato Head are hotspots to watch the sunset with some nice food and a drink.
Timmy T,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2016,"If you would like to enjoy a perfect sunset on a budget, I suggest Seminyak Beach over Kuta or Jimbaran as you don't need to spend a lot to enjoy yourselves.There are lots of bars selling cheap beers on the beach. The best thing is that they even have bean bags!"
Rena G,"Nanjing, China",Sep 2016,"Quite crowded.Not very pretty - a bit dirty.Can be good for some water sports - saw people taking beginner's surfing classes, surfing on their own, water ski etc."
DiAplo,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Nov 2016,"Maybe this is the best beach in Bali. I went to all of them and considering the cleanliness, size, and surroundings, in my opinion this is the best. "
Kerstin E,6 contributions,Nov 2016,Do not recommend Seminyak beach. It is under reconstruction with lots of work going on. Choose another beach!
lprisd,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"super crowded with tourists and surfers. daybed are for rent at 100,000rp if you are not at your hotel beach clubs. lots of peddlers selling goods. many that offers surfing lessons. overall, sunset view is great."
Doug S,"Penkridge, UK",Nov 2016,A good sandybeach with plenty of amenities and sun beds to rent. Beware of the rip tide although red flags and lifeguards are about. Beach get cleaned every morning. 
RupaliGurani,50 contributions,Nov 2016,I would like to visit this place every time I come back to Bali. If you want to chill with your friends then this is the place to go. Sadly couldn't experience sunset but I can imagine the beauty it would add to the already beautiful surrounding. 
Tracy S,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Oct 2016,"don't know that I would swim at the beach, ok to walk down, had to walk passed the temple to get access."
Janice T,41 contributions,Nov 2016,"this is a nice beach.....was a little too wavy when we were there in November but good for surfing.  Lots of beach chairs for rent.  Only negative is there a lots of local trying to sell everything......hats, manicure, scarfs, goods, fruit etc.  They are very persistent so beware to keep your head down and if you buy anything then all vendors will be over to visit and try their luck"
Jamie A,33 contributions,Nov 2016,It is nice for sunset but rather busy so I'm sure you will find another beach which is less busy. But good options to relax with lots of bars and chairs 
Dennis V,25 contributions,Oct 2016,"Being Australian and spoiled by our pristine beaches, I still enjoyed an early morning run and/or an afternoon stroll on Seminyak Beach, which was only a short walk from where I was staying. In the evening there was plenty of atmospheric lounging on the beach where you could wine and dine on the many bean bags and listen to great chill out tunes.  "
Kay D,"Glasgow, UK",Oct 2016,"Not my favorite beach.  Lots of people using beach to walk dogs (no problem with that) but not picking up poo (big Problem with that) Long beach and sand gets darker the nearer  the Volcanic ash.  At the entrance I arrived at had bucket with water and ladle to wash your fee,t nice touch.  "
Quentin R,130 contributions,Nov 2016,"During the night all beaches in Seminyak are full of big colorful pillow, each bar has a live band and all cocktail are very cheap!!The atmosphere is awesome.. That was our first activity in Bali.. A nice mojito on the beach, 30 degrees... What else?"
Trevor G,"Browns Plains, Australia",Nov 2016,"This is one of the highlights for us when we have visited Bali. Sitting on a beanbag, watching the sunsets, while enjoying a cold drink from one of the many bars is just so relaxing. The downside is that you get hassled by lots of people trying to sell you sunglasses, hats, watches, paintings, massages, bracelets, manicures, pedicures, bows and arrows, tasers, lazers and all kinds of Knick Knacks. They can be very persistent but generally a polite ""Sorry, no"" is enough and they will move on."
Travelfan353,"Victoria, Canada",Nov 2016,"There are so many great beaches in Bali..give this one a miss if you can. I'm not sure if it was just the time of year that we were there but there were pretty significant waves breaking near the shore that make this beach difficult to actually swim at. If you enjoy body surfing (or actual surfing) and aren't scared of large waves you might like it here. Also the beach had lovely sun loungers set up all along it that you have to pay to use. You could set up on the sand but it's kind of awkward setting up between the loungers and the sand is really hot. The loungers are expensive and while laying on them you are constantly harassed by vendors selling knock off sunglasses, cheap ""jewelry"", and sarongs. The vendors were non stop and really took away from the enjoyment. Bali has tons of quiet white sand beaches with minimal break, I think it's worth it to put in the effort to find one near you instead of Seminyak Beach :)"
aladin s,"Munich, Germany",Nov 2016,very nice beach and busy but not so crowded. many good bars at the beach to enjoy the sunset by a cocktail.
OmG,"Stanmore, UK",Nov 2016,"...Enjoy!The beach and view is similar to most beaches, but unfortunately there isn't my cleaning going on. Sadly there is a lot of people leaving their left over rubbish. This doesn't ruin the whole beach, just the initial walk up. Once you past the small line of rubbish, you forget it was there and the beach is stunning. Great view as you would expect and in November the waves crashing slightly heavier, which makes for a lovely sound and feel. Just be careful as riptide is quite common."
Michah_V,Singapore,Nov 2016,"Not much crowd at this beach, went from 12nn-3:30pm (maybe that's why)The sand is bloody hot so be sure to be in your flip flops at the very least. Tides/waves were 6/10 in strength. Beginner surfing lessons available here so the wave strength is ideal.More private as it's not as famous as Kuta beach for example but this area is where the more pricey accommodations are.If you want to relax and have a tan or enjoy the sunset here, there are beach chairs and umbrellas along the stretch of the beach BUT a payment of 20,000 Rupiah per person is required (approx. USD2).Also, a lot of lovely places to eat facing the sea along this stretch."
RajThind78,"Great Barr, UK",Nov 2016,"The best beach I visited in Bali, both during the day & evening. Offered great food, my favourite was Capil. The hotel i stayed in had there own subbed area. The evening vibe was stunning, places to sit, eat & drink on the beach with live music. "
Tim W,18 contributions,Nov 2016,"Excellent beach for surfing, not an ideal swimming beach as there are strong currents and waves of some reasonable force."
gailw00ds,"Port Lincoln, Australia",May 2016,"This beach is very relaxing with deck chairs you can hire local girls with massage tables and locals selling their wares,Very safe beach and surf boards for hire along with drink"
Helen C,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"I shared tapas with my friend, chicken tacos divine, prawn and avocado good, chicken sate good. Beautiful evening on bean chairs drinking good Australian wine and bintang, watching sunset while the local talent did a good job of 60's - current hits"
mexistu,"Playa del Carmen, Mexico",Nov 2016,"This beach is fairly clean but not the best in Bali. There is some trash in places but generally ok. The water is not of the blue kind due to the colour of the sand. Seminyak is a nice lively town full of good bars, restaurants and cafes. This is the heart of the bali gay scene with several gay bars."
CynthiaC1962,"New South Wales, Australia",Oct 2016,"Was excellent for food and reasonable prices and easy picking and friendly staff,beautiful sunsets to veiw and have a drink"
Gemma C,"Dublin, Ireland",Jul 2016," Beautiful beach with beautiful sunsets . Don't just stay in one place, walk the stretch and check out some of the bars. Can easily enter some of the hotels with poolside bars/infinity pools for no sunbed fee. "
Keb1993,"Rushden, UK",Oct 2016,"from the airport to the hotel,the walk from the hotel to the beach and the beach in general was not my idea of bali and can defiately say I would never retun if I had to stay there a weekour fist sight of the beach was one of a few dogs emptying out and there was rubbish everywhere.On our way back to the hotel, in the main street in a gutter, was a dead cat which looked like it had been there  for days if not a week or more.On return to hotel, we contacted our travel agent and asked to move resort.On research before we came Seminyak was supposed to be up market. NOT in my book.I would return to Bali but not Seminyak"
Mark W,"Barnsley, UK",Oct 2016," I always thought Bali would be a tropical place with nice white sand beaches. It was a ok beach but was very dirty . Dogs allowded to make a mess on beach which put me off walking on the beach with no footwear. was nice at night when hotels lit up and beach parties where in place, Excellent place if you want to surf. But needs a good clean up"
tigger2594,"Toowoomba, Australia",Nov 2016,"Whilst visiting Bali we took a day trip and spent some time at the beach for a cool off.It's a lovely sandy beach with seats and umbrellas for hire you you can just sit on the sand.Very humid on our day but fine and the water was clean. Resorts seem to front the road then the beach.Of course there are vendors for drinks, ice creams etc. new Parkinson g places were being built when we visited.Lovely place to visit, take a swim and relax. A fair amount of people but not crowded."
AlexvBPerthWA,7 contributions,Nov 2016,"Classic long Bali beach.Glorious sunsets, lots of beachside eateries. Clean.Hawkers not too persistent. "
J P,"Nelson Bay, Australia",Nov 2016,"Sorry but dirty and univiting, soo many better beaches in Bali. Horrible sand with bad currents just not nice."
Lizjak10,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2016,Wherever I am in the world I try to do a morning walk before it gets busy. The beach is nice enough despite the uninviting coffee coloured sand. Most days it was a bunch of dog walkers with lots of locals on Sundays.
MarcoCVerde,"Accra, Ghana",Oct 2016,Nice surprise. Clean water. Good waves for surfing and less congested than Kuta beach. A lot of shopping and restaurants behind.
sinthamahardi,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2016,It's great beach to enjoy sunset around south of Bali. The place was really busy in the evening. The kids will love this so much.
heypa138,Hastings,Oct 2016,"The beach is nice, and the water is warm, and it is a great place to learn to surf.  However, there are a dodgy smells and it would be nice to see a bit more care with cleaning up rubbish, etc.  The locals offer goods for sale, but they don't hassle you so that is fine."
Sabes420,17 contributions,Nov 2016,"This is one of the best beaches I've ever seen. Great sunset, lively environment, family friendly, lots of waves if you're a surfer and you can enjoy the dinner right on the beach. "
IngemarG59,"Luleå, Sweden",Nov 2016,Nice beach with good waves and LOTS of people as it is here.You can find nice food anywhere. Remember sunscreen when u walk around

Heidi C,"Bendigo, Australia",Oct 2016,"What a fun place for a drink or 2 on brightly colored beanbags, under colorful umbrella's  on the beach watching the sunset! lots of bars along this strip of beach..find one where u like the music, sit down and enjoy the view. the food was very good at the bars we went to and the cocktails were well priced and delish. The beach is good for a swim and the water was warm."
Sinead D,6 contributions,Oct 2016,The beach in seminyak is nice but the water is very rough and not enjoyablw for swimming. We have seen nicer beaches elsewhere and for the price you pay to stay around here it is not worth it. If you are looking for a beach holiday go to the Gili islands where there are beautiful white sandy beaches and calm clear water. Also it is way cheaper and not half as crowded and if you explore the island you can find your own little private section of beach which is paradise
Thuyette P,8 contributions,Oct 2016,Busy and alive place nighttime to watch the sunset with a cocktail in the hand ... lot of restaurant and bar !
catrine m,1 contribution,Oct 2016,"i went to visit this Beach a few week Ago, so Many rubbish, plastick, bottle and other, this pace it so touristic and not very comfert for relax"
luckyonelol,"Cranleigh, UK",Oct 2016,As beaches go this was very average. Quite a bit of refuse around and very uninspiring.  Bali needs to clean up their beaches or loose all the tourists! 
llmace,"Mooroolbark, Australia",Oct 2016,"Water is warm, locals playing soccer and beautiful sunsets. There are heaps of on the beach casual restaurants. We and drinks where they had  life band and we danced on the beach"
MariMama2019,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2016,We were there for an afternoon and enjoyed a lot. The water was nice and hot and the waves were quite high. Good for who's trying to surf and it's a beginner-intermediate surfer.
rinasingh09,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Oct 2016,Uncluttered and clean. You might have to check into a good property for the towels and sun roof. Was a lovely experience.
Scully1994,Nerang Queensland Australia,Oct 2016,"Great area to view the fabulous sunsets of Bali. Shopping around the area is a wonderful experience with the flavours of Bali ever present, wafting past to lure you into one of the great eating opportunities "
Leanne D,New Zealand,Oct 2016,Atmosphere - music - just perfect - however cleaner toilets are needed - not to good on that situation 
FloranH,"Maastricht, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,"Ok there are more beautiful beaches in the world, with whiter sand and clearer waters ,this is true. But Seminyak has a great spirit to it, it is not overcrowded like Kuta , and you can easily rent boards to enjoy the nice sand waves with the locals. And yes there are many nice beach bars and restaurants as well.."
AnnaDS,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2016,"In a day the beach looked average, not great for sunbathing or swimming due to massive waves, black dirty looking sand. In the evening it transforms into amazing place to sit on the beanbags sipping cocktails and enjoying the sunset while listening to music "
s b,"Dallas, TX",Oct 2016,Lots of cool restaurants and bars with beautiful sunsets!  Water nice and warm with lots of beach to walk up and down to people watch.
Aefwolf,"San Diego, CA",Oct 2016,This is a great beach for a sunset and a drink. The surf is never that great unless you like pitchy fast closeout beach breaks. The vendors can be annoying after a while. A chair should cost you about 50-100K rupiah. Enjoy
Louise W,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Sunset cocktails on Seminyak Beach were stunning!  Such a fun atmosphere each evening as the Sun goes down, music to enjoy and people watching on Bean Bags!!"
Suzie R,"Johns River, Australia",Oct 2016,"Seminyak Beach is a great spot to be in Bali, the area its self has great shopping and restaurants, the beach well, without fail, great sunsets overnight, there are also lots of great hotels here with beach bars to sit in comfort, have a drink and watch the sun go down."
Greg1D,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"A average beach to visit and not as good as Australian beaches. Surf is often dumpers with strong tows, no life guards. Best to paddle in surf to cool off then watch the sunset from La Lucciola Restaurant or Bar area. (excellent Italian food)"
PDAWG17,39 contributions,Oct 2016,Need to watch out for the dam ozzies if you want a swim as they are all surfers. lovely sand and great bars what have music every night bean bags on beach so you can chill out. only thing what could make this place better is a good shroom seller. worth visit
morgandavies,"Rochdale, UK",Oct 2016,Lovely wide beach...great for surfers. Nice sand ... some people hiring out sunbeds are a bit cheeky and really try to mega overcharge. ..but if you are caeful and get the honest ones you will be OK.  Enjoyed this beach. 
mikeswallow01,"Mexborough, UK",Oct 2016,Nice long open beach of a blackish sand.Beach bars available..when we were there the beach was fairly quiet.
Rajesh G,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2016,"Sunset here is mindblowing. The shore turns into a mirror by sunset and you can get some brilliant photos. The shacks here are open for a long time in the night, so never go thirsty (and hungry :P). Currents and waves are too strong. So keep kids away from the sea."
Melanie H,2 contributions,Sep 2016,This is a surfing beach and not a beach for young children as the currents are strong.  However the beach itself is sandy.
Gary T,"Lake Haven, Australia",Oct 2016,Clouds lined the horizon but even this could not stop the rays of the sunset. Wined and dined on the beach while watching the nighty event take place. 
eleblanc,"Oakville, Canada",Oct 2016,Great beach with waves that were great for new surfers and boogie boards.  Was able to rent a boogie board for $5 CDN per day and 2 chairs and umbrella for $15 CDN.  probably could have bargained harder if we were there longer
roshyrosh,London,Sep 2016,"I loved this beach. I was travelling solo for a bit near the end of my trip and would come here everyday for about 2 hours. Yeah you get bothered a bit, but just be assertive with your ""nos"" and they'll leave you alone. The water was pretty wavey when I was there, loads of people were about with their surfboards/ paddle boards. You can rent a beach lounger for about 50,000 if you haggle - otherwise you'll be given a flat rate of 100,000. Great views, soft sand, warm sea. What more do you need?"
Greg H,Airlie Beach,Oct 2016,Good.clean .good surf.close to the main shopping.can hire a surfboardThere are day beds and umbrellas 
iTravel-A2Z,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"Went for drinks at sunset, it was great. Sea is fairly rough and sunloungers are available everywhere"
Steve D,"Kersbrook, Australia",Oct 2016,This was my first time staying in Seminyak having stayed in Kuta and Legian previously. The area is a lot more relaxed than it's southern neighbours. If you are looking for a more chilled out Bali experience this is the place for you. Loved my stay here. 
peter_blythe,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"Seminyak beach is a great spot to visit.Of a day time there are beach side restaurants ,sun lounges to rent ,surfing and just walking is fun.When the sun goes down there is live music and great atmophere sitting on the bean bags on the sand."
Mums4Kids,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"It is a very long beach with clubs and hotels all along it that invite visitors to share facilities. If you are going to swim, watch out for the currents as they can be fierce. Swim within the monitored areas with life guard patrols."
SinkingSeabourn,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Oct 2016,Really pleasing to see the effort to clean up SEMINYAK beach. Lots of small cafes and bars with cheap food and beer. Surfboard hire and recliners are available.
Kyle Brincefield,"New York City, NY",Oct 2016,"Many of Bali's beaches have a lot of coral and rocks, Seminyak is the MOST beautiful, comfortable beach I visited on our 2 week trip. All beaches in Bali are beautiful, but at Seminyak, you can walk out hundreds and hundreds of feet and still touch. I loved that. The sand and beach are so clean and smooth, it was such a nice alternative to all the other rocky beaches surrounding and the Gili Islands. The rocky beaches are great for photos and are beautiful, but sometimes you just want to swim or lounge and not worry about cutting your feet or getting knocked into rocks. Seminyak is perfect for that. We spent days on this beach enjoying every moment of it. Lots of baby crabs at night that sometimes pop out during the day, but it was cute and fun. LOVE THIS BEACH, can't stress enough."
Deanna B,19 contributions,Aug 2016,"One part of bali I really look forward to is heading down to   Seminyak beach to see the sunset. You have so many bars and food to choose from, or just choose from the live music where you want to sit. It always has such a great vibe there. Yes you always get lots of people trying to sell  to you but that is just part of it.   "
DarreninHK,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2016,Plenty going on on the beach. Lots of independent beach bars to choose from or just play on the sand. 
Sandra G,8 contributions,Oct 2016,"The beach is really clean, important in Indonesia, and it's free of surfboards. You can have sunbathe and, of course, jump the waves. It's not good for swimming."
Mankj65,19 contributions,Aug 2016,The Seminyak beach is very crowded with alot of people playing football. But the ambience is prety good. One the best experience that we have is enjoyed the Bakso in the beach. 
Alex Z,Teufen,Oct 2016,"The beach was in front of our hotel (The Oberoi). Not your white sand dream beach but great to kill a few hours. The waves and currents are quite strong (careful when bathing with little kids), ideal to take your first surf lessons. The water temperature is fantastic, we've stayed in the water for hours. Water and beach were reasonably clean."
Janeric66,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2016,Filthy water the beach is smelly as the sewage water runs stright in to the ocean from the drains running along the street even the hotels toilets come out in the water on seminyak beach...
RamblingRahul,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2016,A long stretch of beach with beach huts where the road from Seminyak ends at the beach. A small red-flag section frequented by surfers.
Yong T,Ampang ,Oct 2016,Seminyak beach located next to / after Legian beach which is perfect not too busy crowded beach stretch after Kuta. Still with perfect sunset view as well as nice beach stretch for swim surf tanning. Nearby resort hotel stay various with standard and one of it is GrandMas hotel with affordable rate and walking distance less than 5 minutes to Seminyak beach. Convenient location with convenient stores and restaurant.
ammaus n,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2016,"I personally don't swim in this beach due to the surf but its lovely to walk along in the mornings, especially on Sundays when the locals are out with their families.  The sun sets are also amazing.  The locals keep it relatively clean and there are a lot of great restaurants ranging in cost along the way."
Rouge_fairy,"Makati, Philippines",Oct 2016,"It's a long stretch of beach, great spot to just take in the view but full of trash. Cigarette butts and plastic everywhere. Waves are pretty strong so never leave your kids unattended. "
lynton1,"Cape Town, South Africa",Sep 2016,"This is a wonderful beach with some of the best sunsets one could imagine. The surf is good, the people friendly and there's Ku De Ta for a cold beer, a pizza or a wonderful meal. I want to go basck!"
Paula B,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"Nice beach, not the best but the location is great with a lot of beachside restaurants and bars (limited vegetarian options and they all seem to have pretty much the same menu).  Week-ends tend to be very crowded.  You can rent chairs, take leisurely walk, swim in designated area (others have big under current)."
Galina R,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2015,"Seminyak beach was just 5 minutes walk from our hotel.The beach is wide and long. There is plenty of space for everyone without felling crowded.We enjoyed some of the most beautiful sunsets here.There are a lot of restaurants, pubs and lounges which you can enjoy for lunch during the day or for a party in the evening.The waves were great. We are not surfers but we still had our fare share of fun. It was a bit of a mission to find a peaceful and quiet spot on the beach where you can relax and don't have to listen to few different kinds of music at the same time.I only have a humble request to some of the dog owners to be considerate and clean after their pets while walking them on the beach.  "
Extraordinary525718,12 contributions,Oct 2016,Nice beach but be prepared for dark volcanic ash sand. The surf looks great for beginners through to advanced. Nice at night also when all lit up for a few drinks on the beach.
Andowhite,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,We went the beach everyday during our two week stay ... Beach was beautiful however very crowed and busy ... It's very busy as lots of hotels close by and shops ... Lots of places to eat and drink nearby ... Beach was very clean and inviting for a swim 
Bellalubliss,Geelong,Jun 2016,It's not a bad beach but certainly not the cleanest which is such a shame. A lot of drains go straight into the ocean and you see a lot of rubbish. You can rent chairs there and be sold jewellery from your beach towel if that's what you are after. Head further north for better beaches.
Marko G,"Las Vegas, NV",Oct 2016,"Good waves, strong undertow. Sand is darker volcanic. Long beach for jogging or walks. Plenty of beach clubs along the way."
Andre B,"Bangkok, Thailand",Oct 2016,"Enjoying this beach for the last 2 days already and still have some more days to go. Only note, the waves are quit high and strong. Don't let your children go out too far in the sea.  "
JaneHalliday,"Phillip Island, Australia",Oct 2016,"Tonight I was very desalinated with the taxi drivers at the beach entrance . I had a injured leg with Stitches and couldn't walk very far. I approached 3 taxi drivers fwo wanted to charge me 500.000 Rp to drive me 400mt to my villa. You have got to be kidding me! One driver was so rude, disrespectful and foul!  Even made boo noises after me. Being an Aussie I soon told him where to go and what to do when he got there!!!I have never been treated like that here in Seminyak , I have been hear numerous times and feel very disappointed . Blue bird taxi drivers are usually very nice. "
greytokyo,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2016,"We paid 100,000 IDR for 2 lounge chairs and 50,000 for a body board.  Had a fun day out with everything within reach - coconuts, cold beers, fresh juice, food.  There were also a handful of vendors walking around trying to sell postcards, sarongs, and fruits.  No one offered massages though, strangely.  A word of caution - don't underestimate the waves.  We saw a number of adults (that's right, not kids) bobbing up and down and moving further and further away from the shore.  3 had to be rescued in one afternoon as they just couldn't swim back.   A tip - we saw surf guards on the beachfront of the Anantara Hotel."
Nae79,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"Gorgeous beach with amazing sunsets! Was very clean, not ridiculously busy, absolutely beautiful and if i could watch sunsets from there every day it would be heaven! "
SandraLara1980,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Seminyak beach is okay and good for long walks but it is not very clean. Also the hawkers selling all kinds of things can be too persistent and lounging on a sunbed reading a book can be a big challenge. They constantly approach the tourists even if you say no many times.
psychey,Sydney,Oct 2016,"Great waves... good for jumping around in it. Beware of beach benches that people flog out for IDR100,000 per bench. You may think it belongs to the hotel, but they don't. Also the sand is extremely hot when you step in it during mid-day. Scorching. Have to wear footwear."
Kunaskun,Jakarta,Oct 2016,"It feels like in Kuta or Jimbaran. Will be jammed in high season. Plus things, because it's Hotspot so easier to reach, many type of rentable beach stuff are available such as umbrella, bean bags, etc. "
Shelle123,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"As far as beaches go it was ok, not busy, only at occasional patches where there were bar shacks 😄 there are no trees or bushes/shrubs. Hardly any sellers driving you mad. Too rough to swim with huge big waves and swell, so it's great if your a confident surfer but if not then you had better stay safe and stick to having a paddle lol lovely for a stroll in the evening or watching people setting off the candle/glow lanterns into the night sky 😘"
Barbara W,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2016,"This beach is very long. We did not walk right up to the surfers part but could see surfers on the waves. Not far from where we came onto the beach we hired clean loungers and an umbrella. 200000for the day or 150000 for three hours for the two loungers and umbrella. The waves were fun and the water warm. Further along were hotels with all their umbrellas and loungers, overlooking the beach. The sunsets were beautiful."
Kawkawa,"Vernon, Canada",Oct 2016,Used Seminyak Beach several times during our stay.. beach loungers and umbrellas can be rented as well as water toys boogie boards surf boards etc... nice place to swim and play
stephanie b,51 contributions,Oct 2016,Do you want to swim in trash? If not then stick to the pool in your hotel. This beach is gross. We preferred batu belig further up  however it still had rubbish floating in it and lots of broken glass on the beach. Unless you are desperate to swim in the surf don't do it.  However the many warungs on the beach are a nice place to sit and view the surf (without trying to swim in it) 
dmw69,"Newcastle, Australia",Oct 2016,"A nice beach to look at especially at sunset, but you can smell the sewage flowing into the ocean via the creeks/outlets along the beach. I shudder to think what you would be swimming in. So we didn't swim at all."
Daniel S,1 contribution,Oct 2016,"The beach is very nice, a good place for sun rise and sun set. Watching sun set with a cup of drink in the nervy restaurant maybe one of your best choices in this spot"
BernieBrown,"London, UK",Oct 2016,"Seminyak beach is beautiful, amazing for surfing (not that I even attempted to) but to hear the waves crashing while lying on the sun bed is so relaxing.It's not the best beach to visit along this coast line but still, if staying in Seminyak, it's certainly worth a visit"
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"Coming at this beach for more than 30 years and it's always super.. the waves are great and the sun is always good. It's near Dyanapura street with lots of warung, restaurants and shops."
Kim O,Cardiff,Nov 2015,We enjoyed a couple of lazy days on this beach with our teenage children.  Plenty of little warungs to eat and drink at and cheap surf board hire.
Dennis T,"Sligo, Ireland",Oct 2016,"Very long stretch of the beach with nice waves, lots of surf schools along the way, bars with nice comfy seats, and just plenty of room for walking/jogging. Not really for swimming, but we still did :-P Nice place"
jewel57,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,Relaxing night sitting on beanbags Only thing was we got hassled a bit by hawkers Great to enjoy sunset cocktails and music 
Annie M,"South Australia, Australia",Oct 2016,A bit too much waves for me but nice for walking and relaxing watching and lovely sunsets - all good 
whitey09,melbourne,Oct 2016,Can can be as energetic as you want here. Either swim surf go for a run or just laze back in a bean bag and watch the sunset
Masego M,"Centurion, South Africa",Oct 2016,the beach was a short walk from our hotel. it is very clean and goes on for miles. the water is very pleasant and are able to swim and surf freely. there are plenty of beach umbrellas to hire so u can lazy around and enjoy the view 
Jean L,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,This beach is definitely not for swimming!  But it's fun to hang out on!! You'll find many people walking along the beach. 
Flashpacker08,"San Diego, CA",Sep 2016,"stroll down the beach, grab a beanbag at sunset, a cool beverage of choice and kick back and listen to the live music and bands... a great spot for a sundowner"
Monika T,9 contributions,Oct 2016,Great for sunset drinks but that's it. Water is disgusting so don't swim. Cocktails and food is average but vibe is nice.
MarinoTeMoana,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2016,La plancha was amazing I had my sister and grand daughter the food and beach experience was unforgettable a must to do especially a special memory with family watching a gorgeous sunset thank you Bali beach
Chad M,perth,Sep 2016,"The beach is great during the day for surfing and swimming, you can rent an umbrella and lounge. There are plenty of cheap restaurants and food and drink vendors.From about 5.30 onwards the restaurants bring out bean bags and you can sit back and watch the sunset. Most of the bars have music and some have live music. "
StephChapple,"South West Rocks, Australia",Oct 2016,"The beach it's self isn't the cleanest (as with most of Bali). There is a lot of rubbish but otherwise there are lots of chairs to hire for the day, people selling snacks and drinks. Lovely spot to catch a sunset and join in on a game of beach soccer with the locals. "
diaozhadelaowai,18 contributions,Oct 2016,"Not nearly as dirty and disgusting as Kuta beach. Not as nice and calming as Jimbaran beach. Annoying hawkers every 2 minutes and expensive beach chairs (prices quoted to us ranged from 150,000 for all day to 150,000 for 2 hours).The waves here are good for surfing. Not practical for unsupervised children.If you stay nearby and have already been to Jimbaran beach, it's worthwhile."
bhatku101,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,We went to the beach the day we landed in Bali . We had walked quite a bit and were very tired and thirsty. We sat down at one of the many places offering drinks and a bite to eat . They were playing some nice music. What we found unique was that part of the seating was bean bags and we really relaxed and enjoyed the evening with drinks and some snacks and found our exhaustion vanishing.
PHDSydney_Australia,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach is pretty ordinary, a long wide beach only fit if you hire a sun lounge. There are lots of much better places to surf in Bali"
Leila_lj,"London, UK",Oct 2016,"Very busy, too much for my liking. And the sea is rough, which is to be expected. Great for surfers, not so much for peaceful swims "
ShezM,"Narre Warren, Australia",Sep 2016,"Long length of beach to wander down with plenty of surf schools, restaurants and sunlounges (although you pay for the lounges) Take your own towel!"
Vipul556,"Mussoorie, India",Oct 2016,"If you just want to sit and relax by the beach at the night with multiple Shacks and good music playing, this is the place to be in Bali.. Go over there and try any of the many places that you'll find.. All have almost the same prices and menu and music playing "
AMSCAN16,United Kingdom,Oct 2016,Visited briefly and had a good time! Like any beach in Bali you will get asked every 5 mins surprise to buy goods! 
Michael R,"Maidstone, UK",Oct 2016,"Iconic beach, no white sands. A lot of vendors bothering you.Not entirely clean, seen better beaches, quite touristy. Untidy beanbags. Roaming dogs.In general ok, good for young people, noisy and a lot of Australians.Must not forget Bali/Indonesia is a relatively poor country. I am pleased for the locals that tourism brings much needed revenue. On the whole enjoyable but with some reservations."
Sam,"Weymouth, UK",Oct 2016,"We parked up our rented moped at this beach right next to the Anantara hotel just after 9.30am, put our towels down in the beach, swam, walked, sunbathed etc. It came to lunchtime so we got back on the moped to find somewhere to eat. As we were getting in the moped 2 locals came up to us saying we have to pay for parking (there were no signs, no barriers and these guys weren't wearing anything official they just had some yellow paper that had 'parking 2000 rupiah' typed on them. We said we were leaving now anyway and that there are no signs and no one was here when we parked up so started to leave, thy kept shouting at us and started swearing ""**** you!"" Considering how lovely and friendly the Balinese people are I was really worried and concerned by the whole experience. At double six beach (where we opted to go after this incident) there is a proper barrier and booth with guys who take the parking charge so that is fine, but who these guys were I have no idea. Horrible experience."
sunshine_sj,"Boston, MA",Oct 2016,I went there for jogging early in the morning. Trashes and smells. I didn't want to dip myself in it. You should have your private pool instead of beach. 
684ma,"London, UK",Sep 2016,"The beach wasn't very clean when we went, not too overly crowded which is a good thing but the tides are very strong so can't really go in for a swim "
Jennifer R,6 contributions,Sep 2016,We headed down after a tough day of shopping and secured comfy beanbags and a first row seat for a pink hazy warm sunset.  Drinks and chatter and the evening grew darkGreat way to finish the busy part of the day.
tarun g,7 contributions,Sep 2016,This is good beach with lot of tourist. Potato house club on this beach is perfect experience. You can have dinner drinks dance pool on potato house club .
AlbertoMay,"Rancho Santa Fe, CA",Sep 2016,Its hard not to like a beach.  The beach is average compared to other beaches in the world. Dark lava sand and just makes this beach not pretty.
LKaur123,"London, UK",Nov 2015,"If in Bali, this beach is definitely definitely worth a visit. Especially at sunset- it is gorgeous. It felt safe and could spend hours there. Also lotsOf places to eat nearby and activities. "
BenWha9,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"While it may not be the best beach around it was certainly a fantastic experience to sit on a bean bag chair, sipping a cool bintang and watching the sunset over the ocean."
Sandy A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"biking about 30 minutes to the beach in the morning, it's quite refreshing. the beach is clean and tempting"
70Aussie,"South Australia, Australia",Sep 2016,"I enjoyed a nice walk along the beach , the waves were very strong now I know why most surf. Refreshing when its so hot."
Prakash M,"Cheltenham, UK",Oct 2016,"Clean beach with lots of sun beds. Surfing facilities offered by many. There are the usual hawkers selling watches, hats, sarongs etc. They don't pester so not really a big problem unlike other countries."
andrewdP1107WC,3 contributions,Sep 2016,"When so close to so many amazing beaches... Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia....  seminyak just doesn't live up to the same standard... no White Sands fringed with palm trees... I'd prefer to enjoy elsewhere"
mcscmsdj,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"I've travelled a lot and I don't have much to say about this.. It's a nice beach but it's nothing special.. Views at sunset are amazing and if you surf then I guess you'd rate it more but for me, it's just a beach."
Louise R,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2016,Dirty and not the type of beach that makes you happy to be on.  The beach itself is great but the sand is so dirty and so much rubbish is washed up and not very appealing. Would be a great beach if it was cleaner.
Helen Y,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"It is an experience to sit on a bean bag under the cute little umbrellas and watch the sunset.  If you are going to Bali, do this."
Hulleman1234,"London, UK",Sep 2016,wonderful clean beach but the water is rough for children or elderly people to swim in.  Plenty of activity on the beach but not crowded - we were there in September.
hopkinstownboy,"Pontypridd, UK",Sep 2016,Visit at sunset when the beach is covered with bean bags with good music and waiter service for food and drinks.
Jessika H,"White Rock, Canada",Sep 2016,"I wanted to see the colourful umbrellas and bean bag chairs and when the taxi dropped me off I didn't see them. I was initially disappointed but soon found out that they put them away every night and only start putting them back out again around 3pm. My recommendation is to find one of the cafes that you like, grab a bean bag, have a drink and enjoy the view! Beautiful waves there with a strong rip tide so be careful but enjoy the water too! "
birdcrazy89,"Tasmania, Australia",Sep 2016,"Beautiful beach, plenty to do and see. There is surfboard hire scattered all along the beach, and plenty of sick waves to use them on. There are beanbags also scattered all along the beach for people to use, these do come at a cost from what i saw. The bean bags belong to the bars along the bars on the beach, so i believe you just but a drink or something. These beanbags and sheltered by fairy lights, and umbrellas. There is also live music. It really is the perfect place just to kick back and have a few drinks.  "
Jessie Z,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"We went to the beach through Potato Head bar. I love blue sea, but Seminyak beach is a bit grey. A bit disappointed."
Tony B,"Wokingham, UK",Sep 2016,"Having been to the beaches north of Seminyak, these was spotless and has obviously been well looked after. "
Wendy H,"Invercargill, New Zealand",Aug 2016,"Amazing experience, lively colours, bargains, music, warm summer breeze, dinner and drinks in sunset set"
Tim09322,"Maroochydore, Australia",Sep 2016,"Dirty, filthy, disgusting, rubbish and a line of cigarette buts from the beach to the ocean as well as a filthy stream smelling like diarrhoea emptying straight into the sea, and that was the good bit."
Rosemary S,11 contributions,Sep 2016,Love Seminyak beach. Lots of charming restaurants on the beach and classy ones on the street if we wanted something more upmarket. Loved Double 6 rooftop bar
yialli,"Greater London, UK",Sep 2016,"Really beautiful at sunset, beds or towel on sand in the day, clean, amenities like food and beer nearby, nice beach. Swimming fine if you don't go out too much. Further out there are big waves and surf, good for surfing and learning though it's hard to get out and it's not the easiest of beaches, there are danger points and you should be a good swimmer as the currents are strong. Overall a lovely beach, sun, food, drinks, umbrellas and beds if you want, fun in the water, what else do you need? More at commonsensible.org"
207aja,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2016,"Access to the beach is tricky due to presence of all the beach-front hotels and lack of sign-posts (don't rely too much on directions given by hotel staff). The beach was fairly clean and I didn't see any seaweed (presumably as the sea is too rough). The waves were quite strong - and a few people were surfing and body-boarding. There was a small number of traders selling kites, clothing, etc. - though we didn't get any hassle. We paid 150K Rp. for a parasol and two loungers for two hours (initially quoted 250K Rp.). A taxi back to the hotel (1.3 km.) cost 40K Rp)."
kamakshi j,"New Delhi, India",Sep 2016,"Although a tad crowded, this place is just perfect for travellers..we didn't engage in any water sports but the sight is delightful"
Rajat Chakraborty,"Nagpur, India",Sep 2016,"This beach is good to visit during early mornings. The tides just prepare to rise and the beach is filled up with joggers. You can go for an early morning surfing classes here. The beach starts getting crowded from 09:00 am onwards. The coastline is smaller, though, and I presume it has lot of rip tides and the flags line up at several points on the beach. Be advised when you are a surfing beginner."
Anand1351,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"Excellent for viewing Sunset, nice darkish Sand which is comfortable for walking miles. Waves are strong so can't swim. Not crowded and no street vendors to hassle. A very relaxing place, plenty of sunbeds available."
fannyhansen,Sweden,Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach has its nice spots, but it has mostly turned into a tourist spot. Living in Australia I'm used to beautiful beaches, and to be honest Seminyak is pretty dirty. Waves are good for beginner surfers though, and it's easy to get here. "
Michael2810,"Hampton, Australia",Sep 2016,"When the tide is out this is a good beach to walk along. There are the usual beach sellers every so often. Whilst the water looks inviting, it is very dangerous for swimmers so stick to your hotel pool. "
selwyn a,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach is highly overrated . Not clean & strong rips . Pleasant enough to walk along or view but don't go in the water. Busy , noisy & lots of vendors hassling you as you walk . Sanur , Jimbaran & Nusa Dua are much nicer & cleaner   "
Chrise000,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Sep 2016,"We were constantly hounded by taxes & people selling stuff. Scooters made walking around Seminyak dangerous & completely unsafe, was pretty scared."
Shamroze Z,9 contributions,Sep 2016,"Seminyak is your typical beach except its not as crowded as Kuta Beach. Vendors do come up to you to buy stuff, but if you say no nicely they dont linger around. The water is very clean and its lovely to go for a dip :) "
LucasBrad,"London, UK",Sep 2016,Great beach that we were able to spend all day on quite happily.Pay 100 IDR for the double sunbeds for all day - they are so comfy!
Morena L,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"Beautiful and relaxing for a walk, listening to the ocean and then looking at an amazing sunset. What a way to finish the day."
Leanne E,"Melbourne, FL",Sep 2016,"I was disappointed with the beach for swimming- bit rough strong under currents and rips- looked quite dangerous. Learn to surfers seemed to enjoy it.This aside, wonderful to sit by the beach and watch and listen to the crashing waves. Wonderful night spot to sit out in a beanbag with a quiet drink and live music listening to the surf. One of the best things I did on my trip to Bali. Understand beautiful explored parasols and lanterns- great memory"
AmiteshPatro,Bhubaneshwar,Jun 2016,Enjoy the Sun n Sands...Loads of Joints to chill and have a blast...stone Throw distance from one to the other.HAve a blast here. Would rate this second to the beaches of Nusa Dua.
YoussefAbdalla,"Alexandria, Egypt",Sep 2016,"in September their is a lot of surfers , the beach is not very good for swimming but the restaurant on the beach are very nice especially on sunset , you could sit and eat and drink and enjoy the view"
TomJohnston52,"Edinburgh, UK",Sep 2016,"On Bali's west coast this is a dramatic stretch of beach, with a lot of quality hotels behind. It is in contrast to Kuta to the south, which is more raucous. Good surfing for beginners, if that's your thing. We went for a good hour's walk every morning, and were often back in the evening for a sundowner while watching the spectacular sunsets. There is a temple at the Petitenget end and you will often witness religious ceremonies and music of various types. I wouldn't bring kids to Bali for a beach holiday, as the sun is just too strong. With a decent base tan when we arrived, there were one or two days when we were a bit red at the end, even after a walk on a rare cloudy morning. Subject to that, this is a wonderful place. Work continues to tidy up the surroundings. We wouldn't have missed our daily fix."
Grant B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"We went down to the beach today to take advantage of our Hotels Beach Club facilities and I would recommend if you are staying at the Haven Hotel whilst in Bali to utilise this facility.The beach itself offers a great chance to body surf , board ride or boogie board as there was a constant wave.The beach is for those with medium to above swimming skills because the surf is quite powerful and there at times is a strong undertow and rip which could trouble those with not so good swimming skills."
Lena S,32 contributions,Sep 2016,"This beach is clean and beautiful! We loved coming here to walk around and swim. The waves can be a big strong and the lifeguards won't always let you swim, but you can always get your feet wet in the warm water. "
Jonas Ørnes A,"Oslo, Norway",Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach is beautiful and stretches for several kilometers. It is quite clean and have nice sand. It is also quiet compared to other beaches in Bali, but you can still rent sun beds and umbrellas. Many resorts are located along the beach, and at night there's some bars putting out tables and chairs. Make sure to visit La Plancha. The beach is not good for swimming though. The currents are too strong, so you shouldn't really swim here. That is too bad. But beautiful beach. "
BaheyaZeitoun,"Cairo Governorate, Egypt",Aug 2016,"The beach is suitable for surfers, swimmers and tanners. While it is best suited for surfers, because of it's high waves, I thoroughly enjoyed swimming through the waves instead. There are several small restaurants along the beach, as well as local venders, henna artists and masseuses. Topped off with soft black-ish sand and a strong Balinese sun, this beach is worth a visit if you're staying in or near Seminyak."
Wayne495,"Balclutha, New Zealand",Sep 2016,Beautiful beach nice sand but very little shelter no chairs like Kuta and the sea was to rough in the two weeks we were there to swim during the day we wold end up getting a cab to Kuta or in the pool at potatoe head if you could fit
Scho1e,"Cambridge, UK",Sep 2016,"I am indifferent about Seminyak beach, if your looking for a nice quiet white sand beach that you want to relax on and get some sun, then it's not for you, try looking elsewhere in Bali. There is a lovely spot outside the Oberoi that is quiet as they ban loungers and parasols. At sunset the view is amazing and we have been a few times to watch it. It's fun watching the surfers and the people watching etc. You can't swim in the seas as its too dangerous and you will be pulled in by lifeguards. There is plenty to do, ku de ta is buzzing and looks like a good place to chill and drink with music. Weekend was rammed with locals and tourists, but there is enough quiet spots if you look for them"
Coral S,Brisbane,Sep 2016,Loved the freedom of being a short walk to sea.    Lots of people enjoying beach and sea swimming.   Lounge beds available if you want and drinks
Julian S,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"We enjoyed the view of Seminyak beach from the Legian hotel.Pros - warm water, not to many hawkers, sand dark but not black sand as we know it, felt safeCons - rubbish on the beach, some stray dogs which were easily avoided, streams flowing to sea across beach smelly, surf too rough when we were there to swimLooked fantastic from the hotel pool but wasn't a swimming option for us."
zpclan,"Quebec City, Canada",Sep 2016,"Nice clean beach, lot of people and warungs, big waves, nice spot to learn surf. Nice sand. Easy access and free. Some itinerant sellers."
BodhiZephyer,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2016,Our hotel was situated on the beach. The waves were pretty awesome most of the time so if you're not experienced with beaches than its best to stay in shallow water. The sand is very black and you end up with dirty feet. There's heaps of dogs so obviously they urinate and poop on the beach (we saw this happen a bit) so you need to be careful when you're walking. The local people have lounges that you can rent during the day and beanbags at night. There are lots of people coming up to you and trying to sell you things so it's not overly relaxing. There's always places to rent boards from or learn to surf and places where you can get a drink of you want. The beach isn't very clean and there's lots of rubbish and offerings floating/blowing around. The beaches are ok if you've never experienced beaches but if you've been lucky enough to come from a country or area where the beaches are clean with white sand you won't be very impressed. 
Andrewpence917,"San Jose, CA",Sep 2016,"The beach was absolutely beautiful! We arrived just as the sun was setting. My biggest complaint was the amount of people on the beach. Couldn't walk in any particular direction, had to zigzag the whole time. Also, you had to cross a small stream to get onto the beach, which was awkward. "
Ellie_homer1,"Chipping Norton, UK",Sep 2016,"Fabulous beach for cooling off with a nice walk along the shore.. the waves are huge and not really an ideal swimming beach, however it is still beautiful and definitely worth walking. There are a few sewage spot which are not very nice but overall its beautiful!!!"
angdavieds72,5 contributions,Aug 2016,"A very quirky beach once you get past the main drag of people, theirs always going to be people selling products but they're all friendly people!"
eegeckil,"Nizwa, Oman",Sep 2016,"If you wanna do beach bumming then this beach is excellent for that. Have a beer at one of the bars on the beach, listen to the sound of the waves. But don't dream about swimming."
juvinsee,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2016,"Seminyak Beach offers great sunset views. Coupled with so many beach bars along the whole stretch, we had an amazing time just cradling our beers on the colourful bean bags on the beach on one of our nights in Bali. The waves were good for surfers too! Will definitely come to Seminyak Beach again."
Kaatkins1,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2016,"Beautiful beach with loads of chilled out beach bars offering live djs, music and dancers. Drinks are reasonably priced and sunsets to die for.  Perfect for surfers and great fun for everybody else."
Timmi002,"Washington DC, DC",Jul 2016,"Great people watching here.  Tons of places to rent chairs and umbrellas, get a beer or some food.  If you want peace and quiet this isn't the place for you as there are tons of locals selling selfie sticks, sarongs, sunglasses, you name it.  After saying no once they will keep coming back thinking that you might have changed your mind in the 15 minutes that they were away from you :-)  The surf is amazing.  As the tide goes out in the afternoon the beach expands and you can go way out and the water will only be at your ankles.  This is also the place to be nighttime as at sunset it gets crowded with people hanging out at bars and restos on bean bags, having cocktails and taking selfies.  Then after sunset it takes on a more club feel with cool music and just a very relaxed Bali vibe.  "
chrisandann2016,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Sep 2016,Stopped at the Juice Bar for a drink and a bite to eat. Lots to watch on the beach with good waves for the surfers. Usual vendors along the beach. Water was warm but a lot of the beach is too rough for swimming. Great beach to wander along.
Terry S,"Nottingham, UK",Sep 2016,The beach at Seminyak is busy with access to the sea front hotels and the other accommodations with clear access offering beach front bars and places to eat suitable for all. The sea is well suited for surfers but during periods of the day also suitable for swimmers as long as they abide by notices and do not venture out too far.The sunset views over the beach are amazing with the waves crashing and the reflections from the setting sun shown up n the shallow waters.A must to see if you are in this area.
MissYou89,7 contributions,Sep 2016,Nice place to get Beer or chilling while see the sunset. Some good and cheap restaurant around.  Kinda busy
robirob15,"Berlin, Germany",Sep 2016,"It may not be as nice as some of the white beaches in the south of Bali and you will never be alone here, but for families this is a good beach to relax, with food, massages, drinks and everything you need at hand. There are no rocks in the water, just watch the current during outgoing tide.The surf is good for beginners, so a nice place to have a lesson. On good days the waves can be good even for more advanced surfers, but chances are you'll find more quality breaks further south or west..."
kladdkaka,"Stockholm, Sweden",Sep 2016,"With all the luxury resorts, i expected more. To windy to relax. To dirty to enjoy a dip. General garbage and small plastic balls (frigolit). Kuta is so much nicer actually."
jancomark,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2016,Nice place to cool down in the evening at the lounge bars along the beach.. Grab some bites with a cold drink and enjoy. 
Helen K,"London, UK",Sep 2016,Spent the afternoon and evening on the beach here and had an amazing time. Sea is ideal for surfers so the water is a bit rough with plenty of waves but had so much fun in the water. Came here specifically for the sunset on the beach and we weren't disappointed! Beanbags are brought out late afternoon for you to relax and enjoy a drink while you watch. This beach gets a massive thumbs up from me. 👍🏻
willi h,chonburi,Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach is really nice,perfect for long walks. Unfortunately the waves were very strong, swimming practically impossible."
VFL74,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2016,We enjoyed walking along the beachParts were dirty but I was expecting a lot worseClean in the morning and outside the most of the hotels
Veniese W,30 contributions,Sep 2016,"The beach has just enough people to be a great place for people watching, but not so many that you fee crowd in any way. The ladies and gentlemen selling their goods along the beach are not too agressive and who doesn't want to enjoy a mango or pineapple.The beachbeds are comfortable and placed apart in a very desirable distance. The shoreline is evasive...you have walk out a distance to get any depth. This was by far my most relaxing beach experience in a long time. The bars that surround the beach have a great variety of food and beverages to enhance your beach bumming."
Alfian Dakhi,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2016,A place that is really good for sunbathing during the day and for chilling during the night. The beach has a lot of restaurants by the beach with live music that you can choose.
Ms_Chona,"Cagayan de Oro, Philippines",Sep 2016,"Waves can be large so its not great for swimming. Best thing to do is rent a chair (around 200,000 for two) and umbrella to watch the sun set. Not too many tourists and it is very relaxing. Dog walkers and joggers also around"
katherine l,"Clinton, Australia",Sep 2016,The beach was not too busy on the day we visited. We did not go to Bali to visit beaches but we thought we should at least have a look. The beach was beautiful and clean and you could clearly see where to swim between the flags. i did not go in as i was terrified by the waves but lots of others were swimming. We did not get hassled on the beach and there was no one selling stuff which was nice.
Brooke G,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"The beach has lots of entertainment, nice bars and restaurants. The beach itself is ok, apart from the sewage streams that trickles down into the sea. It wasn't pleasant having to walk through them as you go along the beach front.. It smelt terrible and you couldn't help but think you're walking through **** Apart from that, the beach is big, has lots of places to sunbathe and is apparently great for surfing (the sea is quite rough) "
85RG,41 contributions,Sep 2016,"Its a must do. Relaxing, clean, people are really nice and the bars stay open until late with no problem serving you in your beach gear!"
PurviPatel1991,"Greater London, UK",Jun 2016,"I stayed in Seminayak in end of June, I found that this beach was very quiet compare to Kuta beach. It's very clean and have some great bars near by."
Kristen N,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"Absolutely beautiful. A must-visit especially for sunset (starts around 5.30pm local time). Plenty of beach bars available for beers. Beware of touting tho, and prices here can be slightly elevated as compared to what you get elsewhere. Afterall, this is a tourist spot."
noosadoer,"Noosa Heads, Australia",Sep 2016,"Coming from Australia we are spoilt for beach choices and certainly used to the surf. Seminyak is rough, with a really strong undertow. Do not swim alone here."
Blossom S,"Arzignano, Italy",Sep 2016,Less crowded compare with Kuta beach and For sure Don't miss watch the Sunset in Seminyak Beach if the weather are good it's So beautiful... 
Somi2013,"Madikeri, India",Sep 2016,We stayed in Destiny which was 10 mins walk from the beach. The beach is nice and waves are quiet strong. We loved the array of restaurants there with live music and bean bags. We just relaxed and took some pics. I was with my 1 year old so just ordered french fries and pina colada. Its great for people who want to have party time with chilled beer.  
Lalx154,"Quito, Ecuador",Sep 2016,"Surfing for beginners, ideal lounging on the beach, cheap beer from same sun bed person. Sun beds go for 100,000 though I chose to pay 50,000 for 2 hours as I didnt plan to stay there that long. Swimming is for people who enjoy tall waves."
CheeKianWing,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"The Seminyak Beach has several things going for it: fine sand, a deep beachfront and non-overcrowding (unlike Kuta). However, the main drawback is that there is little else in the way of things to do. No snorkeling, no diving, no surfing etc.One hour is more than sufficient for this beach."
chooho1124,"Seoul, South Korea",Sep 2016,"Great beach not crowded by tourists. More serene and peaceful. I stayed in Seminyak Beach Resort and Spa, and it was beyond my expectations with very warm, accommodating, and professional staffs as well as beauuuuutiful facilities. "
KLMabb,perth,Sep 2016,Loved the walks along the Seminyak beach. It's large and wide and you can stroll along the upmarket big hotels. Lots of security and also beach chairs available. Don't miss it. Sunsets are stunning.
Ricky F,5 contributions,Sep 2016,Bear in mind a lot of sunbeds incur a charge and it may be better to sit at a beach bar and get a drink and a free seat included.
Gabriela S,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"While in Seminyak for a short holiday visiting the beach was a must. Awesome sunset, live bands all along the beach, fresh grilled corn knobs and boiled peanuts absolutely delicious. It was hard to choose from the many inviting places to have a meal. Ended up at D'Goglo. Yummy food eaten on small table and bean bags on the beach. Loved it."
Veronica G,"Eltham, Australia",Sep 2016,"Seminyak beach is a premier location to relax and enjoy the mix of sands,  sea,  surf and nightlife in Bali.  Hawkers are friendly and not overly intrusive; an inevitable part off tourist culture. Lots of food on offer and they live music is a treat;   from soft rock to folk to blues,  old school festival feel with the sounds of the rhythmic pounding of the surf only metres away. Fantastic sunsets perfect the scene. Like all good parties it comes to an end with the resulting mess on show at daybreak,  to be swept up ready for the next party to begin. "
GlennieB469,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,It was an overcast day when we ventured out but it was peaceful enough strolling along the shore and checking out all of the restaurants facing the beach. The sand was a sort of grey and a bit scratchy but ok to walk on. There was a bit of surf and a few surfers and wind surfers in the water which was ok to paddle in. Not sure if i'd hang out on a deck chair on the beach but maybe if it was linked to a resort I might give it a go.
Alaa C,10 contributions,Sep 2016,"Beautiful beach with strong waves which I have never experienced before. Besides, it's relatively safe as there are alot of restaurants around. However, there are no changing cubicles or showers."
Jo Phaji E,1 contribution,Jun 2016,We walked a long the beach and enjoyed the sunset.Very clean beach if I compare with another beach that I have visited before. WE LOVE IT.
Stefanie L,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2016,Nice view with beautiful shades of blue of the sky and the ocean. It gets too crowded sometimes. It's quite a commercialised place but still fine for photos
Oztravels7,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,This beach is very difficult to access unless you are staying at the W Hotel as this is about the best place to access it from. On my way out I used another exit which took me back down strange small roads and alley ways. I certainly felt very unsafe. There were also vendors selling goods I the beach that were quite annoying.
montysamui,"Ko Samui, Thailand",Sep 2016,"Quiet and clean beach. Not suitable for swimming, but good for meeting sunset and relaxing in one of the restaurants"
Laura K,"Amityville, NY",Sep 2016,Great beach for long walks...surf schools...sunbathing. At night all the beach bars have bean bag chairs and umbrellas and candles and live music.  And of course food and drink...great place to relax and soak up the local vibe...
Lorraine,"Rickmansworth, UK",Sep 2016,Visited for a long walk which we really enjoyed. Nice to watch the waves rolling in. It is not recommended you swim here so can only dip your feet when it's hot. 
Karan M,England,Aug 2016,The only access is via the Ku DeTa restaurant.  Then you have to walk down broken and dangerous steps to get to the beach.  There is no access visa any other beach front hotel as security staff guard the entrances.  The beach front is reasonably clean and more popular in the evenings when the beer is flowing.
Hokidaymaker057,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,Not really a swimming beach however great for walking for those into fitness.  Lots of surfing spots along the way and sunbeds to relax
kimberly B,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2016,definitely have dinner at one of the great restaurants on this beach. Sunset is at 6:15 and it is a romantic setting. Don't go bear foot the sand is from shells and isn't soft like our Canadian white sand beaches. Chairs and umbrellas for rent on the beach. 
well-travelled4321,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2016,Seminyak beach is actually Kuta beach all the way north to Canggu and sees beach. This is just one long beach facing west and is the offshore wind side of the island during the dry season from April to October. Fantastically long beach with great low tide beach walks.
jadybugs,"Calgary, Canada",Aug 2016,We went to the beach a few times.  We found it hard to access the beach and walked for awhile before being able to enter and same with when we walked along the beach we found it hard to exit.  Plus the beach isn't great for walking up and down so if this is what you are looking for this stretch made it tough!
Debolina B,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2016,Great beach near the breezes bali resort and spa where we were put up. Loads of beach shacks present to just unwind and relax.
jackiLondonUk,london uk,Jul 2016,"went twice while walking around the sholling centre by sea front. lotsof exspensive hotels.very windy, but if you like wind surfing and such then this beach is definatly for you. lots of people guest and locals. people did swim but we had been told that the under currents are very dangerous... don't think I would spend a week here. but then I don't surf."
Stella G,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"Hey thereI have been to Bali many times. During my recent stay my friend and I needed to exchange Australian dolllars and did so at an ""Authorized Money Exchange"" who advertised no commission The money was counted in front of us and placed on the counter.Lucky for us i recounted the money only to find it was substantially shortWhen I questioned this the seller took the money back and recounted the correct amount With over 30 years cash handling experience i was baffled at how i could have miscounnted. ..so i recounted and again it was short!!!I  decided not to go ahead and walked away. After speaking with other travelers they also had this experience.Its a scam and its like magic...like professional card players the money disappears in front of your eyes.Once the money is counted for you...hold it in your hands and recount it and then DO NOT LET it go....not for a second as they are so quick! They will try to distract you by asking you for change saying that they don't have any...walk away as the legit mkney exchange has chsngeThey lure you in by offering a better rateSafe travels all"
Graeme E,3 contributions,Aug 2016,"Massive expanse of beach shore line, plenty of cafe and restaurants to sit outside, day and night. Bit of pestering fron local sellers of tat, but will go away when told."
benkalra,"Chandigarh, India",Sep 2016,"Beach is Superb for Sunset View It has very nice Beach Facing  Eating Points where you can Enjoy GRILLED FOOD , BEER , DRINKS.You Can simply walk from This Beach Upto Kuta Beach , with great view and low sea tides.... Must Must Visit"
Chaïmae A,122 contributions,Sep 2016,"Better than kuta beach i loved this place swimming is difficult you just get your feet wet and thats it so dangerous but lovely view and quiet , clean..."
Ric S,"Welwyn Garden City, UK",Aug 2016,fantastic beach with superb lifeguards due to its location.wonderful sunsets and plenty of umbrellas & loungers if you're staying at one of the hotels along its length.
gaytelford,"Telford, UK",Sep 2016,Crashing waves.. perfect beach and an array of fabulous beach bars.. just beautiful. A nice breeze to take off the heat.
Shannah H,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Apr 2016,Go to another beach in Bali of you don't want to feel like you're in a western country/be surrounded by touts/get badgered into buying drugs etc. plenty of other nicer beaches to visit! 
Randi Julian Miranda,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"Good to spend the afternoon here watching beautiful sunset across the sea. They have lots of cafes stretching alongside the beach where you can sit and relax with some fresh cocktails.Anticipate for some souvenirs sellers offering you to buy their stuffs. They can be annoying sometimes, so you better refuse politely if you aren't interested in the beginning yo avoid them from pestering you. "
Vicki H,"Taupo, New Zealand",Sep 2016,"Staying in seminyak decided to check out the beach.  Only 15min walk through the streets which you could stop and barter if you wanted to. Then the beach...wow sand surf and sun. Absolutely beautiful. We are in here now (early September 2016) and the weather is gorgeous. Water warm no sandflies....a few hawkers but l wanted a serong so called one over.  Next minute, the watch guy and jewelry lady were right there....didn't even see them coming haha. If you just be polite and firm with the No they get it. Such a cool place to see highly recommend a visit while in seminyak especially if the weather is hot. "
Cakes1991,"Hertfordshire, UK",Aug 2016,"After being told that the beaches in Seminyak weren't that nice, i was slightly worried as i thought this may effect my holiday, however, the beach was lovely and me and my boyfriend spent most days there. The waves are very strong so perfect for surfing  (if that is your thing). The only annoying thing, is you constantly have people coming up to you to sell you things. They are however very friendly!!"
Hayley W,"Pimpama, Australia",Sep 2016,"Coarse dark sand and lots of rips. Good for small children as the waves roll in a long way so they can jump the smaller waves close to shore. Downside is the constant harrassment from sellers who never stop trying. Don't pay more than $10 for a day bed and umbrella, they often start bargaining at $30. Nice views."
A786KGemma,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jun 2016,"Close to bars and hostels, this beach is the most touristic one on the island. I guess a must see but it would be the shame to stop only to this one as for me this was not the best! This beach is great is you are looking for activities like surf lessons, bars, etc... but it can be sometimes very dirty with plastic packagings..."
Melbournetown01,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"The beach is nice enough, the water is clean and although not anything like your average aus beach it's still worth a visit, pull up a sun bed under an umbrella and watch the day go by. It's good fun and excellent people watching!"
Julie E,"London, UK",Sep 2016,"We walked the length of the beaches from petitenget to Kuta and stopped at Seminyak as it was the nicest part. There are fewer hawkers (although still quite a lot) and it is less busy but still had a great vibe. There are also restaurants on the actual sand which there aren't at Kuta. We stopped at Taris beach bar which was particularly good, with nice seating out front and very reasonable prices which included tax and service charges (unlike most places). The sand was lovely and soft (although too hot in the midday sun) and the water was great. Seemed a great spot for surfing too with lots of people learning in this area. Would definitely recommend it! "
tomac1957,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,We walked every morning to Seminyak beach to enjoy a swim before breakfast. We found the area in front of The Oberoi  hotel to be the best but beware the sand is very hot !
Rokhsaneh R,9 contributions,Sep 2016,The sky... The clouds.. The changing colors of the sunset ... The moon & the stars & the reflection of all these colors on the shore makes you fall in love with earth
FunFlyingFour,"Okinawa City, Japan",Aug 2016,"we were staying in an AirBnb Property only a couple minutes walk from Seminyak Beach so naturally we visited any chance we could. what I loved about the beach is that despite the many visitors, it was still a nice laid back feel to it. It was a great place to ""people watch"" with many people surfing or having lessons, people riding horseback, going for runs, or simply relaxing on one of the lounges offered by the restaurants. At night beanbags and umbrellas are set up with the restaurants also offering live music.  A great place to chill! Our young children loved Seminyak Beach - both during the day and at night."
carolynsouter82,"Albion Park, Australia",Aug 2016,"Dinner at Gado Gado at sunset just the best, the food was of the highest quality, if you get the chance soft shell crab is absolutely stunning "

Joanne205205,"Avoca Beach, Australia",Sep 2016,"Just before sunset the bars along the beach out out beanbags, tables and umbrellas with lights on. There are bands set up at each bar.... Where you can see sunset behind them. This is a must !!!! "
Gillian W,Perth,Jul 2016,Beautiful to walk along the beach in all weather at any time of day!The water and sand are clean and safe!
DutchTrvlr,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2016,Clean beach with lots of sunbeds and places to drink. Swimming is actually prohibited according to the flags in the water but everyone seemed to ignore this. This is probably because of the surfers. The waves were very fun to swim in but be careful of the current. 
Dameon G,"Mount Vernon, NY",Sep 2016,This beach is very nice to lounge around or if you're into surfing. The water is kind of rough but the beach is very pretty and relaxing.
dayulaksmi,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"We really love the beach and the ambience surrounded there, the weather at that time was really nice and there're lots of boutique nearby which offer lots of good stuff with good price."
Oana Breazu,"Doha, Qatar",Aug 2016,"Clean, spacious, relaxing beach. Good for surfing. Worth going.In the night you will find amazing atmosphere with food and drinks at the beach bars who organise shows and concerts every night."
spannerwingnut,"London, UK",Aug 2016,"The fact that you can't really swim in the sea, that some sewage flows down the beach and into the sea, and that the beach is littered with rubbish, makes this not the greatest strip of beach! Maybe if you are staying at one of the beach front resorts your experience will be better, obviously it's always awesome to see the ocean. We were expecting more after reading so many great things, we thought we had missed something. The bean bag bars are the only reason to come to the coast. Shame about the drunk people trying to light Chinese lanterns, and sellers trying to sell you random crap, it's ok just to hang at one of the bars. I think if you skip this area you won't miss much. "
Lauren A,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"Went to Seminyak each early in the morning which was nice and peaceful, got 2 day beds for $10, the man was happy to get us drinks at low price when needed. Beach not that suitable for swimming very strong waves and strong current. Annoying around lunch time when they have people trying to sell you items."
juhiSaluja,"Noida, India",Aug 2016,Loved this beach! It was beautiful in the evening and had a calm that could transport you to your favourite memory!
brittsnz,11 contributions,Aug 2016,"Seminyak is great for drinks and a  it to eat at sunset. Seminyak is also great for shopping, both expensive boutiques, smaller bohtiques or market. "
graziella f,"New York City, NY",Jul 2016,I want to first make a disclaimer that I went into this trip believing I would see crystal clear blue waters. Unfortunately that isn't what this beach looks like. Aside from the fact that the sand was as soft as silk the water was brown-ish. What a let down! The water was less than a foot deep for as far as I could see. Which did make for a great place for me to make my first attempt at surfing!
ChrisRooboy1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Great Sunsets every day over the ocean. There are plenty of places to get cold drinks and hire couch or just sit on towel on the clean sand. I had a couple of good massages on the beach.
Tamara G,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,I enjoy going down there at night and during the day. Although a little expensive for drinks the atmosphere is great. 
Phil4218,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2016,"Lets be clear, it's not Australia or the med, it's Bali so it can be a little dirty. Despite that, it's a nice place"
497Bruce,"Hoddesdon, UK",Aug 2016,"It is a lovely wide beach with great sand. We didn't try to swim, but although the waves seemed quite strong, others were swimming and it seemed safe. There didn't seem to be much shade, or sunbeds, unless you attached yourself to a beach club"
GCF77,"Madrid, Spain",Feb 2016,"All the images you have of a balinese tropical paradise, with white sandy beaches lined with palm trees and clear blue sea. Forget that. Seminyak is an urban beach, with hotels and restaurants where palm tress should have been. And the white sand is not son white and full of litter that comes from... the sea..."
Selma110,London,Aug 2016,"Good for surfing, not so good for swimming.  You have to bargain for best deal when hiring or requiring surfing lessons.  The beach has one after theother of surfing stalls."
ItalyReporter,"Bergamo, Italy",Aug 2016,"Long sandy beach stretching from Kuta, Legian to Seminyak. Less busy than the nearby beaches and not so good for surfing but excellent for chill out! "
Holly H,"Bonney Lake, Washington, United States",Aug 2016,"Nice beach, not as crowded as kuta. Beach chairs with umbrellas to rent really cheap and nice. Our hotel was right on this beach very nice. Fun restaurants to watch the sunset on this beach"
calmci,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Beach is expansive and good for everyone. Good hotels with beachfront terraces are great for food and beaching at your convenience.
leamterrace131,"Rhos-on-Sea, UK",Aug 2016,A beautiful  beach and lots going on. We hired beach loungers and there were opportunities  to surf etc.However... massive warning. Be aware of the rip tides. I was pulled out of the sea by 2 life guards and another man when I was dragged back by the strong rip tide. I wasn't in deep but the surf and pull was extremely  overpowering.  Luckily my daughter raised the alarm and I was rescued.  I was taken by ambulance to the BMIC hospital in Kuta. They were brilliant. What wonderful nurses and doctors. After  spending a night in IT I was well enough to continue my holiday.Thank God for the life guards .So my major message is enjoy this beautiful  beach but be aware of the flags . Yellow and red  flags means it's ok to swim  but just be aware.Also swim near life guard spots.Kuta beach can be the same. Be vigilant. Respect the ocean.A massive thank you to those life guards. They surely saved my life.
Lisa T,7 contributions,Aug 2016,"The waves were gorgeous. You can admire the surfers in action. Plus it is where Ku De Ta is located, so you can pop by after playing at the beach. There is even a water point for you to wash away the sand from your feet - free for everybody. But need to be careful if you have young kids because the waves are so strong that they can suddenly swell up from ankle deep to thigh deep in just a few seconds."
clairenich0ls,"Cronulla, Australia",Aug 2016,As an Australian I'd have to say the beach is not as good as ours but the sunset on a beach can never be bad. Good to run along and to watch people practice their boxing.
Camanda80,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"Was a short walk from our hotel. Place was quite crowded, so we skipped messing around after some photo shots."
SchwanenHolgi,"St. Petersburg, Russia",Jul 2016,"This beach offers you all comforts you can imagine: high waves for surfing, glassy surface during low tide; broad beach for jogging and games, strong push back during high tide; party beach with drinks and music or calm places back of the sea; spectacular sun downs as well as tropical thunderstorms; a happy and joyful get together of all nationalities regardless of any religion...this is how beach life should look like!"
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,you could easily reach this beach by going north from Kuta Beach. there are several restaurant that took part of this beach but you could still enjoy the beach. this beach is perfect for sport activity as the sand is soft and wont hurt your feet. the entrance fee is free
Marty T,"Meeniyan, Australia",Aug 2016,"Great beach to visit, lively atmosphere, kids parents, lovers, runners, walkers, kites, playing dogs, you name it! Probably the best people watching beach I have visited bar Copacabana. And the sunsets are the best part for me!"
Manjusha P,22 contributions,Aug 2016,"Beautiful beach, amazing people. Try to catch the sunset so no point going on a cloudy day. Beware of stray dogs though. Some food souvenir shops too. "
Stephanie H,15 contributions,Aug 2016,"The sunset is amazing, not as many people hasseling you to buy things although ive been three times this year and Seminyak is getting busier and more expensive. Kids playing as the sun goes down is the best part of our trips here, then live music on the beach at night. "
Alwaysablade,"Sheffield, UK",Aug 2016,"Long sandy beach, good for walking. Sun beds comfy - you have to barter, if you return for a number of days the person selling the sun beds will remember you and give a good price. We paid on average 180,000 rupiah for two beds and an umbrella from 11 am until around 5.30. You can buy ice cold drinks from the sunbed seller as well. If you like playing in the waves then this is place for you, surfing, boogie boarding- not swimming though. There are loads of locals selling their crafts. After a day on the beach the sunsets can be spectacular and the bars bordering the beach come to life with live music. We have enjoyed 10 days in Seminyak"
SammyJS,"Cardiff, UK",Aug 2016,"Lovely clean beach with groups, couples and families. You can sit and watch the surfers with a drink it hand. Plenty of beach bars and restaurants on the beach and the strip, but the sunset here is stunning. "
Joanna F,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"My partner and I strolled down to the beach from our resort not knowing what to expect, lots of restaurants with bean bags, lights and great food, some even had live music, great night"
Jo G,"Wateringen, The Netherlands",Aug 2016,"The beach is very nice, huge waves, nice breeze and very nice coffee restaurants near beach. all people are pleasant, and it is very peacefull."
eugenia w,"Tucson, AZ",Aug 2016,"...is palpable as soon as your feet hit the sand. The light and quality of the water are unique to this place, and I found it all mesmerizing.  This is certainly one of the most groovy beaches I have experienced with miles of delicious sand and people of all persuasions enjoying the surf, the dining and imbibing."
Bkap11,"London, UK",Aug 2016,Best sunsets happen on this beach. The waves are awesome as well!! Normally gets busier as the day progresses. Overall really enjoyed riding the waves.
Paradise84364,"Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia",Aug 2016,Was glorious water down by la Plancha. Further North the waste water pours down in rivers from the town and I'm sure is highly polluted. The further north you go the worse it smells.
David E,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"Just love Seminyak beach at night, so much going on and so many places to enjoy the evening sunset.We enjoy being away from the hustle and bustle of Kuta where everything is so much in your face. Seminyak gives you everything at just the right tempo - restaurants, shopping, beach life and atmospherc.  "
DiveCultureSG,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"I am a regular in Bali, and i would always visit this beach out of all the other beaches in Bali. Not only that it isn't so crowded, but it is clean also compared to the other main beaches in Bali. The sunsets are also nicer as compared to Kuta. Location does really play a big role. I am a big fan of sunsets."
matt d,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,Water is noce and has waves to surf body or buggy board. The locals on the beach sell beer and have beds to lay on. You can have surfing lessons and get you hair braded. Many many activities
NINA M,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"best time on the beach is during sunset , 5.00pm A place called La Plancha is awesome.great music /Djand great menu !!"
Rachna86,"New Delhi, India",Aug 2016,Lovely beach with great shacks to have a beer and food. Excellent for surfers too as the waves were awesome!
Amanda W,"Wallaroo, Australia",Aug 2016,"We arrived to the beach around 4;30pm and the beach was buzzing. Pulled up on a beanbag and drank bintangs while listening to a band and watching the sunset, beautiful and relaxing!"
robqu,"Brooklyn Park, Australia",Aug 2016,Beautiful and clean beach. Great for boogie boarding and surfing. Just swim between the flags as there is quite a rip!! Not too many people either which is s bonus. 
Dawsay,"Leeds, UK",Apr 2016,Nice beach but not the best I've ever seen. Never got too crowded and was more suited for a stroll than perhaps a day at the beach.  The locals loved it and in the evenings it really came to life.Sunset was beautiful and worth the visit just for this.
Wayfarer_Dave,"Salzburg, Austria",Jul 2016,"I've been to Seminyak many times now and love it. The beach is fantastic, I love going to La Plancha and the other beach bars to get a mid afternoon drink in between splashing in the surf and relaxing on one of the many recliners. As the sun nears the moment of spectacular sunsets I transition to one of the colourful beanbag chairs to enjoy the view. Then, I stay at a nearby hotel so I can quickly shower, change and get to one of Seminyak's many gorgeous delicious restaurants. It's easy enough to rent a motorcycle or hire a driver to go up and around the island on longer days to view the many temples, rice terraces and other more Balinese favourite spots. I will warn that our fellow Australian neighbours tend to get a bit crazy and exhibit at times an appalling lack of respect for the local people and other tourists. But, hey, there are many Aussies that are super charming and delightful... I love you guys. Just reign in the trashy types a bit better... frankly, it's embarrassing. We all want to have a good time in this friendly, gorgeous place... it doesn't require falling on the ground or vomiting in the bushes to make that possible. Our Indonesian hosts would appreciate your thoughtfulness as well.Do keep in mind that Seminyak is in the trio of townships along western Bali that are most commercial and frequented by tourists. You can minimise the negative impacts of this by keeping your daily travel to a minimum, locating your accommodations close to where you want to spend most of your time and planning all day tours for yourself that start early in the morning before traffic gets really ramped up."
John F,43 contributions,Aug 2016,Seminyak beach is a great spot to relax have a quiet drink and watch another bali sunset go down. There are not as many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach here so you can relax more. I would recommend semiyak beach for drinks food and relaxation.
Steve C,"Sanur, Indonesia",Aug 2016,Many people visit Seminyak Beach to swim during the day but in the evening it's about walking along the water's edge taking in the beautiful sunsets and the many attractions along the beach. Kite surfers and horseback riders silhouetted in gold and bronze by the setting Sun made fabulous photo memories. Many ceremonies are being enacted in Bali at the moment and there was a gathering of Balinese families enjoying the twilight beach in traditional white and yellow bringing offerings and sharing the peaceful atmosphere. Wonderful moment.
Anthea W,"Cheddar, UK",Aug 2016,"Within walking distance of our villa which was great. Easy access, choice of sun beds or just a towel on the beach. There are safety flags for swimming but be cautious as there can be a strong undertow. Beach was clean from rubbish. Would recommend a visit. "
T S,"Jupiter, FL",Aug 2016,Enjoyed the waves and the sunset but could not forget the five waterlogged diapers sitting on the beach. 
Paras S,27 contributions,Aug 2016,Chilled on the beach to see the sunset...what more can one say but was stunning!Definitely add to the list of things that one MUST do when visiting Seminyak!!
Johnsnelgrove,"Hong Kong, China",Aug 2016,This is a really good public beach that is available 24 hours. But a couple of things: dog poo and pollution stop it being a great beach . Clean it up and you gave a 5 star to
Jose G,"Valencian Country, Spain",Aug 2016,"Big beach, not much shade (none). Bring your own shade, and towels, and surfboard, and lunch. There is some street vendors around, maybe more up the way, did not venture down to far."
Anne-marie S,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"Not the best indicator of traditional Balinese culture. Over crowded, with better beaches 30 mins away. We preferred spending time in Ubud, Keramas, Amed, Gili Meno etc. since we were after culture. Stay here if you don't want experience Indonesia. :) plenty of party spots and night life if your into that sorta stuff. :) :) It is more expensive here with plenty of scammers than the rest of Bali. (It is part of the Kuta party scene, we heard the night clubs from our hotel). "
Natsta14,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Clean, lots of little restaurants and bars, big waves, what more could you want. There are sun beds and chairs/bean bags but need to be early to get them. "
Dean S,6 contributions,Aug 2016,Went down to the beach to watch the sunset and have drinks sitting on the beanbags listening to the different music in each location. Negative is the locals trying to sell you stuff all the time!
Sarah R,28 contributions,Jul 2016,"On our two week holiday to Seminyak, the beach was our favourite place to be. Throughout the day it's no so busy so great to relax of for the kids. It tends to get busier when everyone comes to watch the sunset, one word WOW!!!!. The beach is so clean, gorgeous sand, hardly any shells, so great to walk on barefoot. The sea is amazing for waves, fab place to hire a body board or surf board. Life guards are exceptional and very observant, due to the tide getting strong at times. It's by far the best beach we have ever been on, definitely recommend."
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Aug 2016,"Great beach, good waves, beautiful sunsets, nice beach bars. Only in high season it can get very crowded here. But the beach is big enough"
Achibitsy,"Bucharest, Romania",Aug 2016,"The beach beds are colorful. The Balinese umbrellas too. It is a nice place to sit and relax. Beach boys were very helpful. The prices are lower than Kuta. One of the beach boys recommended us a place to eat. Good food, small prices. "
JuliaMedved,2 contributions,Aug 2016,"Dirty beach, maybe a bit cleaner than Legian but still lots of rubbish everywhere on the beach. There are a few Warungs on the way as everywhere in Bali to buy beer, but not many. Quite a few beachfront luxury hotels with sea view etc. Waves are ok if you want to swim. We are not surfers so can't say anything about surfing conditions. Worth going to Echo point beach for cleaner sand and nice views"
Cheryl H,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"Nice to visit for short stay but other coastal beaches are nicer in Bali...try Uluwatu, Padang Padang or Jimbaran Bay"
expatinindo2016,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Not the best in Bali, If you want the sunshine this is a great place. tends to get busy during afternoon."
wonderingtraveller80,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2016,"this is place for learning to surf, the tides are manageable and the whole experience is enjoyable, plenty of places to eat, drink and watch the sunset"
beegee165,"Tallahassee, FL",Aug 2016,"I was disappointed. There was alot of trash in the water. The surf was so strong couldn't really swim, just stand and let the waves crash around you. Lots of surfers in training, but no real waves for them to ride, waves broke before any rideable curl. There were warning flags for rip currents and if you didn't get knocked down while waves were coming in there was a big chance they were dragging you out! We got 2 lounge chairs and an umbrella for 150k and had it for as long as we wanted. Lots of people walking around selling food and souvenirs. "
Eatenjoysleep,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,"Good beach, clean, nice waves up to three meters high. It can be dangerous in the water at some spots because of outwards currents but these are pinpointed by lifeguards with flags on the beach. I do freaking hate the guys working on the beach overcharging for the sunbeds and umbrella. Our hotel hostess told us 100 rp. is normal for 2 beds and an umbrella. They asked for 200-300 so we ended up with our beachtowel on the sand, which is free obviously"
Kungandhi,Delhi,Jun 2016,Good beach to get relax with friends and family and activities are enjoyful. very nice weather and enjoying beach with family. 
Paul P,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Seminyak beach is a dark sand beach with some famous bars, beach clubs and restaurants alongside as well as some high end hotels. Why on earth they can't look after the beach is beyond me. It's full of rubbish from visitors and vendors. If the bars weren't here, no-one would visit because there are a million other beaches that are better than this."
travelynnemiles,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Not a beach swimmer ourselves, but we went for the sunset and eats. Was a hot day for this time of year.Late arvo and the place was mad with people sitting on the beach in front of cafes & bars.  Crazy seeing so many people there and we were only on the Southern side of it."
sheeatsshewrites,"Guangzhou, China",Aug 2016,Senmiyak is a nice beach with easy waves for those looking to learn how to surf. There are loads of locals who offer board rental and classes.
Perlissima,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,Not overcrowded. Clean with lovely waves for swimming and surfing (beginners). Places to eat and drink at various points along the way. Pretty great bars on the sand to enjoy sunsets!
Wade M,"Paralowie, Australia",Aug 2016,"To me this was just a beach, nice view from sitting up at Resturant. But water is not great, beach was not 100% clean, rubbish about a bit. Ultimately, there is better choice for nicer beaches over on Bali. "
Pallavi T,5 contributions,May 2016,this is the perfect place to chill and crowded but peaceful.awesome bars are there and you can enjoy live music.   
Orchardsam,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",Aug 2016,Not as busy as other beaches as more out of the way.  Several surf rental shops on the beach.  Drinks and snacks at hotel beach bars.  Stunning location for sunset.  Clean and friendly.
Mal L,"Leicestershire, UK",Aug 2016,"Good beach great surf life guard on duty, is busy, only draw back No off people selling junk pestering you!"
DeHeavenTour Official,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is always been our favourite place to hang out with friends and family. The beach is super safe for small kids. Sand is very powdery. Food and drinks at night cafe has variety menus and affordable price. Live music is awesome. And the sunset is fabolous scenery people has to see. Love love love it
mrchris2012,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,Lovely in the evening for a stroll. Daytime wil be busy with hawkers selling everything so just grab a chair (pay) sit down and enjoy the view.
Erin G,30 contributions,Aug 2016,"A lot of scammers and money hungry people, stay on your game and if you don't want something say NO from the very start. Otherwise a beautiful beach. "
Michael B,7 contributions,Aug 2016,"Ok for anyone that wants to visit for their first time please understand the following Cons:1) the sand is not white and appears to have black volcanic ash in it 2) the water is not crystal clear nor blue it is more green / brown 3) some of the fresh water run off is full of rotting vegetation waste and stinks so bad 4) there are no free toilets 5) beach vendors wonder up and down trying to sell things. Be polite and just say ""tee dack Terry Me Ka See"" this means no thank you. Learn this line ASAPPros:1) lots of atmosphere and great sunsets! The music is great everyone is friendly and very festival like! 2) great location and useful beach to walk from Kuta to Seminyak often quicker then riding a taxi  3) there are some great waves and it's great to learn to surf 4) there are red and orange flags for swimming with lifeguards watching to patrol (always follow their instructions)5) there are cheap sun lounges for rent and umbrellas. The price fluctuates with supply and demand. If it's Saturday and sunny expect to pay up to  $aud10.00 for 2 beds for the day! Get over it the beers are only $2.50 consider it the cheapest cover charge. If you want nice white sandy beaches ask a local uber driver and 30 mins away you can get to a white sandy beach. "
Cat L,27 contributions,Aug 2016,"Having stayed in packed Kuta before, I thought I'd take my friend and I to the recommended Seminyak for a bit more up market lifestyle.The beach is definitely better standard than Kuta as it is less packed, has nicer bars with nicer food and seating areas and more reasonably priced beds for the day (norm 100'000 per bed for the day).Great bars for sunset which serve pretty decent food and some good sunsets.However, there are constant waves here with strong currents. Swimming isn't really possible, but jumping waves is as is trying our surfing! Definitely would not recommend for families with small kids who want to swim, or poor swimmers.Head to Nusa Dua for calmer and bluer seas with whiter sands. We did for a day!"
Samrat R,17 contributions,Aug 2016,It's a shame we didn't get enough time here. The beach has big waves and a nice sunset. You can laze here whole day. It will be good to have public toilets (you can pay a small fee to the warungs to do your business)
World Traveller,"Santa Barbara, CA",Aug 2016,"We took a walk along the beach around 3km and while it is packed full of tourists and locals we were shocked to find what looked and smelled like sewage draining into the sea! This did not seem to deter anyone tho! There are great waves on this beach and plenty of surfers but on this particular day there was a very strong undercurrent and the lifeguards were out and blowing whistles and waving the ref flags! It's a lively walk and seemed relatively safe! Many hotels border the beachfront and there are some nice bars and restaurants overlooking the sea! There is some great live music at night, nice place for drinks and dinner! Note that there are lots of pan handlers selling different things on the beach! A simple 'no thanks' and they usually leave you alone! "
Aformz,78 contributions,Aug 2016,Nice beach. Dont have to worry about being harassed as you would in kuta. Lots of great beach shacks around offering good food and drinks at good prices 
Amiya-Poonam,"Hyderabad, India",Aug 2016,"Good beach. Nice sunset view. Little crowded and IMO could be better kept as well. There are many other better beaches that I have been to, but can go (especially for the sunset view), if you are in that area."
Jaymie B,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,Sat here on the beach almost every night at a friends beach bar. Chilled under the umbrellas with a cold Bintang until the sun began to set and then I would go out near the water and watch the sun come down. Absolutely beautiful sunsets in Bali and watching it on the beach is just mesmerising. 
Jerry Z,5 contributions,Jul 2016,Just a beach. But still nice to visit. Make sure you swim between the flags or you will be caught in a strong rip
Natalie K,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,Lots to see at this beach.  Great at sunset.  If your looking for peace and quiet this is not the location. 👍🏻
DWgoldengrove,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2016,Unfortunately beach is full of much litter and the odd syringe. Its a  shame because Seminyak is a quieter spot than Kuta but still suffers from the same issues. More upmarket 5 Star hotels along this stretch and generally a higher concentration of European tourists visit here.
josie m,United Kingdom,Aug 2016,"We stayed in seminyak for 3 days. The beach was okay, however, there was a lot of rubbish that made its way into the water. Not the best beach and certainly not the prettiest. Chairs cost 100,000 irp for the whole day. Not a bad price! "
BapaCooch,"Basin View, Australia",Aug 2016,"As a beach, it's got dark coarse sand, and waves. What is really nice are the many places to sit a watch sunsets"
The_Billy_Whizz,14 contributions,Aug 2016,"But it's definitely not a pretty beach! Steeply raked down to the ocean on the northern side and really quite rough with a strong drag. Definitely not a swimming beach whilst we were there in early August. Sand looks volcanic and is very dark and rough. Unfortunately, there is also a significant sewage outlet and if you're walking along the beach, there's no option but to step through it. Some significant works taking place alongside the waste outlet whilst we were there and WH&S was most definitely not on the builders list of importance so be very careful trying to get on and off the beach there. Fairly strong security will not let you off the beach and through one of the hotels until you get all the way down to Legian or an equal distance north and about 300 m past Potato Head so make sure that you're up for a walk I wouldn't suggest Seminyak if you want a beach holiday."
l_williams7,"Birkenhead, UK",Aug 2016,"we stayed in seminyak for a week and went for a walk along the beach. i was worried having read some other reviews about it being untidy, it certainly wasnt on the occasions i went! Sitting in one of the bean bag bars and watching the sunset with a dronk of your choice is a must!! Plus the beach sellers are really friendly and you can pick up a bargain too if you wish! Live music plays as you drink and watch the waves and sunset!"
Andysafrica11,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"A great beach to walk early in the morning, before it gets too hot. Lovely to watch the sun set as well with a cool drink."
Arthur747,"Foiano Della Chiana, Italy",Jul 2016,"We loved this beach. But you can only swim on parts of the beach.The baywatch guys (sorry no busty girls in orange swimsuits) keep blowing their whistles to move swimmers to a safer place due to high current. You are pulled back into the sea by this. They leave swimmers with a surf board be, but they do not know if these are beginners of professionals. So be careful if you are not an experience surfer as the current is very strong here. You can rent a bed for 50K and order cheap Bintang bear with these guys too. Friendly guys."
Graham P,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",Jul 2016,"this beach is very popular especially at sunset when the view of the setting sun is spectacular, being a short walk from most hotels and resorts makes it accessible "
sflsenglish,"Chiang Mai, Thailand",Aug 2016,"The Sands is in a good central location with live music and a DJ in the evening, Seminyak has a reputation for spectacular sunsets. "
Sharlene K,"Victoria, Australia",Jul 2016,Finding our way to the beach was quite a challenge but once we found it they were very busy  don't try to sit on the provided chairs as they Cost 1500 rup  for a half hour  great sunsets though 
michelleborg2016,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Wonderful experience with the family. Seafood, Sunset what more do you want. Such a spiritual feeling ....... try it you'll love it."
karpenisi,"Greenacre, Australia",Aug 2016,Walked down from Courtyard Marriot where we stayed  lots of motor bikes everywhere. The beach is not clean so we just walked back to enjoy the pool in our hotel. 
altem,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"We took the kids, relaxed and watched the sunset and meet some awesome people there, entertainment was really good as well."
John B,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,The beach has been cleaned up over recent years but the creeks running into the sea need further urgent attention. I would not be swimming anywhere near the creeks (read drains) but well away is fine.The sunsets are magic.
Peter M,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,Great place to hang out and soak up the sun and have a beer or two. Excellent eating spots along the beach front.
Nithin,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2015,The water here is clear and is a very good place to Surf. There are many eateries which serve very good local and international cuisine.
thetravelbuddha,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Grab a beanbag, grab a beer and watch the sunset (along with the 4000 other people doing the same). Get there early to get the front row."
Desti R,9 contributions,Jul 2016,"the beach has some cafe that have a colorfull beanbag to chill and watch the sunset, nice place to hangout with your friends."
robynmaree99,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"We sat at the beach at the end of our resort, took a bottle of wine and watched the sunset.  There were people flying kites, walking past, swimming and live music to add to the feel of the night. Very relaxed, nobody hassled us to buy anything as we were staying at The Royal Beach Resort, so sellers aren't allowed to approach you"
nomadmattm,275 contributions,Jul 2016,"The saying is when in Rome; but when I'm Seminyak make sure you hit the beach! Many little eateries, grab some sliders, a Bintang and watch the sun set, awesomeness! "
L337337,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Good surf. Plenty to do. Lots of beach restaurants and bars to watch the sunset!The bed 'salesman' are a determined lot and will obviously allow you to overpay. 50,000 should secure you a bed and umbrella. Lots of folks selling things which can be annoying.  Until the ice cream man appears......then we're talking!"
Thow E,22 contributions,Jul 2016,It's fun to spend time here. The waves are awesome for sea sports or just play. The sand and water are crystal clear. 
Vikrant0308,"Amritsar, India",Jul 2016,"I went to seminyak beach after kuta beach, so I felt that Seminyak beach is not that happening as kuta beach, But cleanliness is good on beach, and is near KU DE TA and patato beach head"
vithiya S,7 contributions,Jul 2016,"No words can describe the beauty of this beach.   It's simply stunning and the water is so clean.  The sand is also great, making it a wonderful relaxation spot.  Definitely a must go place in bali."
Shelley D,"West Kelowna, Canada",Jul 2016,"Loved this beach! Ran on it every morning. Surfed, swam and sunbathed during the day and enjoyed the beach restaurants with live music every night! Paradise!"
joel r,8 contributions,Jun 2016,Some pictures i captured on Seminyak beach so relaxing sitting back and enjoying the moment.Looking forward to going again on a holiday
Boppojr,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Ok this isn't your storybook beach, no white sand and light blue water here, but. It's fun, bigger than normal surf at certain times of the day, meters from most hotels, warm and just easy. It's no doubt polluted and there area some smelly steams leading into it, but not massively more than any Asian beach or if the bay's & beaches of many Australian cities like Sydney & Melbourne, just swim well away from the streams "
dancer662015,"Crawley, UK",Apr 2016,"There are two halves to the beach, from the entrance to the right is a quiet long stretch of sand and to the left is a bustling vibrant beach bar and watersports stretch. Lovely place to walk early morning, fairly empty with just a few dog walkers, joggers, surfers  and yoga enthusiasts. During the day and evening it gets much livelier with the bars filling up, all competing at night to have the best / loudest live music! Food and drink can be found easily and cheaply and it's a good spot for a sociable evening / night. For surfing the waves tend to be suitable for beginners and there are a lot of surfing schools towards the far end of the beach where the moped track runs along the back. The track / road along the back of it dies get very busy with mopeds but that's Bali for you! "
Vicki B,147 contributions,Jul 2016,"I spent 6 hours chilling at this beach this afternoon and this evening. We experienced chillin on the beach bean bags, refreshing drinks, food, market sellers and to top off a beautiful sunset we were provided live band playing till late. Highly recommend for families too. 😀"
thadeshwar,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Jul 2016,"its a long beach and clean,and the sand is good to walk on but not so fine,get a cheap foot massage done,one can get beach beds on hire at reasonable rate or simply hang out at kudeta lounge"
pbxl1,brussels,Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is a quite place to enjoy a slowly sunset. The sea current is dangerous but gives you beautiful sights of the waves.
Jun L,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2016,"Not recommended for family with young kids due to strong waves and current, beach was not clean, lot of disposable  plastic on the shoreline"
Zara L,13 contributions,Nov 2015,"Gorgeous beach to enjoy all day, with many an opportunity taken to sunbake or have drinks each night and one of the many esky's. At times it can unfortunately have a bit of rubbish deposited on it. Overall I lovely place to take a walk or have a drink! "
TonyBernardo,"London, UK",Sep 2015,Seminyak ended up being my favourite beach spot! Not so crowded as its southern neighbours!! Some fine restaurants and beach bars! And that's when we start to see some quality resorts!!
Cycorp,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"Had some of the best times EVER of my life at this beach! I still remember back when all the hustle and bustle was at Kuta's Legian Beach and Seminyak seemed so quiet and far off yet the two beaches connected. As time went by and more and more people decided to make Bali home did this Seminyak beach along with one of its now world-famous establishments, KUDETA, did it explode as THE NEW beach to be at and be seen on. The last time I must say was that there must have been some shifts in energies between the Earth, Moon and Su, because never have I ever felt such a dramatic and immense energy of the sea pulling me and my kids out so sea, not once but almost three times!The beach looked like the tundra plains of Alaska at one stage and then suddenly huge waves as high as 2.5Meters would come crashing towards us and the many other brave ones in the sea that day. I had to hold with as much strength as I could muster as the kids were being literally dragged out to sea! Truly incredible and what an awesome sight and experience for all to witness and feel the power of Nature in all its its rawness!Were the kids scared? Maybe a little.Was I scared? Yeah, I think so.Will we be back? ABSOLUTELY!!! 😃😂"
LittleNickyA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,I love swimming here anytime of day. Before breakfast you can have the beach to yourself and if you swim out to the breakers and look back over the Oberoi hotel you can see the volcanoes in the distance when the sky is clear. During the day the beach us usually quite busy but still fun. In the evening lots of people come down to watch the sunset 
Natasha R,"Tauranga, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"One thing I had to do each morning before entering the beach was walk around the rubbish and dogs... Bali is clearly over loaded by tourism. The people are really in your face, even when your sitting in a restaurant on the beach just wanting to relax and sip cocktails... Time and time again I would get hassled and miss my sunset moment. I love Bali. But they really need to stop the hawkers as it's quite annoying and unpleasant. Also ridiculous charges to hire beach lounges! $40! For the day. Food pretty expensive on beach. Loved the live music, movies and good quality eats. Surf was ok pretty dumpy. "
AussieWonderlust,"Launceston, Australia",Jul 2016,"We spent 2 days on the beach.  We hired 2 sun lounges with an umbrella and told our host to keep the Bintangs coming!  The water is super warm but beware for the rip tides and the big wave dumpers.  You will be inundated with Balinese trying to sell their wares.  This is part of the beach experience - definitely stop the ladies with the fruit, you won't be disappointed!  Don't be afraid to eat local.  Some of the best food is sold on the back of a motorcycle.  There are a few pop up kitchens on the beach run by local women.  This food is so cheap and fresh and ridiculously cheap.  They even deliver it to your sun lounge.TIPS:Make sure you put on lots of sunscreen, even though you're in the shade those UVs punch through everything!Take the time to pick your beach host - the guy trying to get you to sit on his sun lounges.  Some a nicer/better than others.You'll need to pay approx 4000-5000 RP for a trip to the toilets on the beach"
ancilla w,10 contributions,Jul 2016,"It is a happening place with locals playing  soccer, people swimming and surfing and people chilling with a drink..."
Marc P,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"the beach is on par with most beaches in bali. Once you get there you can spend the whole day and evening there. Food ,drinks,sunbeds,surfing and the perfect place to watch the sunset having a meal and drinks.."
Reemsh21,"Middleton, WI",Jul 2016,Clean beach but watch out for the waves and tides! They are quite high and if you are not a good swimmer I wouldn't even suggest going in! Water is clean though and the sand is free of rocks and shells that hurt your feet.   
pkfong,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2016,Seminyak Beach is a lovely stretch of sand with waves  lapping onshore. Tourists still throng the shoreline. Watch out for the occasional drug pusher as happened when I was there. Decline politely when touts approach you. Otherwise it remains a pleasant place to walk and enjoy the sea breeze. Five star hotels dot this area and they have good dining facilities if you wish to splurge on a meal.
Kevin t,"Jindalee, Australia",Jul 2016,On my first visit to Bali I went to seminyak beach and was disappointed due to the fact that it was totally unappealing there were huge King tides and it was unsuitable for swimming and relaxing .I expected the beach to be better and the waves smaller on my second visit however exactly the same .Seminyak has a good vibe and is a great area but the beach lets it down
Sonya K,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is beautiful. The sand isn't white but oh so soft. The sunset is just exquisite to watch while sitting in the bean bags provided by the local restaurants. Staff will take your orders for drinks, snacks and/or dinner. The locals will want you to buy their wares, be direct if you aren't interested. It is their livelihood after all. "
purplepeta,93 contributions,Jun 2016,Seminyak is my favourite beach it's clean and always something going on my favourite place to eat is along there too ! We can buy things on the beach and get pampered by lovely Ella 💜 the tide was a bit high this year but that doesn't stop us from going I would just be careful at high tide! The locals here are lovely and not too pushy 
Susan S,2 contributions,Jul 2016,"Not very clean, but they have had a couple of storms.  Lot of rubbish on the beach and surrounds.Would not hurry back there again."
Paul H,5 contributions,Feb 2016,"Never seen anything like this. Rubbish everywhere. I was informed that it is like this, every year at this time (February). People on the beach selling things very pushy, don't like taking no for an answer. One in particular was extremely rude. Water was a great temperature, although when you get out you have plastic bags stuck to you.The beach was that disgusting that I took photo's of it. The locals do there best to get it cleaned up every morning before the tourists get down there, to no avail. "
Wah L,11 contributions,Aug 2015,"It was definitely a good plan during honeymoon to have a relax romantic dinner at the beach. There is also live band singing and it is an option to give tips. the seafood is fresh and they do serve tiger prawn, and variety of fish."
Peter_Pfister888,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,Beach is nice but due to heavy waves and strong current can't swim in the sea especially children. Lost sunglasses and slippers due to heavy waves which was not pleasant to walk back without slippers.
Farid Abd,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,"Nice beach to go in the morning. Clean water. Long Stretch of beach. There's a lot of sun beds but you need to pay. I don't know the price as I didn't use. There's people doing exercises, learning surfing...etc. but if you go to the side where it's near double 6 hotel the beach is less crowded."
juzz_9,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is a clean, relaxing destination to hire a sun lounge and soak up the beautiful Bali sun!  The service you get in the beach is incredible....lady selling pineapples and cutting up in front of you, Bintang sold by the vendors on the beach, icy poles as you lay there....you don't have to move.  The Balinese are such lovely, friendly people who never harass you to purchase their wears.  I fall more in love with Seminyak beach the more times I go!  Highly recommend putting your feet up and choosing this awesome beach destination!  "
Mark S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"Always something going on no matter if it's during the day to sit & relax or surf along with having a lunch or at night when the beach bars/restaurants are a buzz with live music.Some of the eateries are better than others and can be expensive when comparing to prices in restaurants along the Seminyak strip, but the sunset ting is what you pay for, quite wonderful.Yes those selling anything and everything can be annoying but still a worthwhile experience."
Praise Chee,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Jul 2016,It's amazing in the evening especially after sunset as there is live band playing some music. The beach is long. They have a few of outdoor cafe with serves you some food and drinks. There is beam bags at the beach with a small table where u can enjoy the stars and lighting of the city. The locals are selling the lantern to the tourist with rph 100000 but if we buy from the restaurant waiter they can give a cheaper price. The sand at the beach is soft and sandy. It's comfortable and cooling
potatolord 5,72 contributions,Jul 2016,Perfectly pleasant as beaches go. The waves in this area are well suited to surfing but not to paddling for small children. There are occasional lifeguards in the area which seem to be connected to some of the beachfront hotels. They weren't always looking seaward. 
betty1957,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Very good staff always at hand making sue you are comfortable and shuttle always arrived on time did not have problems with hawkers on the beach not allowed in our area
Axiomwatson,"Torquay, Australia",Jul 2016,"A very average beach - ok for the younger crowd I guess, but not what I would call an attractive beach."
Sarah V,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Nice beach to sit down and watch the sun set! There aren't too many vendors hassling you and it's great to sit near the beach clubs to hear the music and chill out.Great beach to relax and pop into the beach clubs for a drink. 
holidaycoco,"Chengdu, China",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is great fun for catching waves, learning how to surf, having a nap and lounging around. Lots of people around enjoying the same things. Water is warm, sand is clean. Many dogs in this area, walking around freely. Often they go chase each other. Very fun to watch!Lots of seating areas. Often depending on what hotel you're in. The seats have Hotel names on them, such as Harris Hotel, Horrison and The Courtyard, etc.."
radwa s,"Cairo, Egypt",Jul 2016,"The beach was v clean, and a long strip.We paid 100Rupes for 2 sun beds for 1 hr- you need to bargain heavily as is the case with all bali. Only con is the locals passing by selling stuff other than that its just perfect specially foe a free beach"
Chris B,"Miranda, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak Beach is very popular. Nice sand and a wide stretching beach with many waterfront restaurants. Good during the day, better at night. Music played all day and late into the night. You can swim, surf, play ball games on the beach or simply enjoy a cold drink under the umbrellas and watch the action in front of you."
Rakesh K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,Long and clean beach. Not overcrowded. Lovely walk along at any time. Lot of activities along the beach. Feel safe. Food and drinks always on hand
cassiesim,Melbourne,Jul 2016,Gotta visit if you're staying in Seminyak! Makes no sense if you don't pop by from one of the nearby beach clubs or restaurants :) 
ReggieLombard,"London, UK",Jul 2016,beautiful beach with plenty of waves and soft sand to chill out on. Fantastic sunsets!One drawback was the dirty water flowing into the sea - not sure where it came from but it did smell!
voulas_travels,"Limassol City, Cyprus",Jan 2016,"unfortunately at the time of year that we went, the beach was full of rubbish up and down the shoreline.  Im not sure if that is all year through but it was very dissapointing"
ParamaliJetsetter,"Puerto de la Cruz, Spain",Jul 2016,"Very disappointed with this beach, when we went there was rubbish strewn all over the beach. There are only a handful of sunbeds and the owners tried to charge 200,000 rupees for 2 beds, paid only 50.000 at Legian. "
Jean & John C,"Monasteraden, Ireland",Jul 2016,Nice beach and lots of hotels around for lunch or an early dinner after a day on the beach.   Very clean and good amenities
NoakhaillaBHOOT,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2016,"Its THE best beach in Bali to spend the day with your family and friends. Its not crazy crowed like Kuta or Legian Beach. Also for me, the crowd here seemed a bit better in terms of ""class"" (sorry for being politically incorrect) ... but its true!!! Kuta and Legian beaches are like fish markets compared to this one. This beach is much much cleaner and the restaurants on the beach are quite nice, nothing great but just nice. You can rent seats/umbrella for USD 20 for the whole day, surf boards are USD 7.5, body boards are USD 4 !!! There are beer guys right at the beach, they serve really chilled beers and drinks (with nuts) right to you on the sand. Its awesome. But the best part was the water, it was warm to perfection. We simply loved our time at the Seminyak beach. I highly recommend this one."
IngridHughes,"Lugo, Spain",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is a very long sandy beach, not the best for swimming, in fact it is very dangerous to do so in most parts but it's great for surfing. The beach isn't too dirty although there are some areas where dirty water and sewers come out. There are many beachside bars with poufs or chairs on the sand, lovely for chilling out and watching the beautiful sun set!"
happytrip80,"Bristol, UK",Jun 2016,"The beach smelled with sewage. After staying in other lovely beaches such as Gili Meno island and Lombok, I was quite disappointed with this side of beach"
Camper151349,68 contributions,Jul 2016,Lovely beach and perfect for romantic stroll or a surfing session!vendors selling beer and soft drinks and snacks!enjoy 😉
Darren O,22 contributions,Jul 2016,Waves can vary on swell size. But beautiful sandy beach sand Colour is slightly grey but still a beautiful beach. A three year old would be fine in the shallows. And even if your a surfer there is a rideable wave every day for mid to novice surfers.  On a good day I've seen good surfers out there but it's not pipeline or bells beach.   Boards n lessons for hire on beach 
Joyce A,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,When in seminak head down the beach for sunset hire a bean bag sip on a cocktail and soak up the atmosphere enjoy the beats or an acoustic treat order a cheap pizza All in all relaxing and fun and won't blow the budget 
gabbystanden,"Pacific Coast Australia, Australia",Jul 2016,the beach was polluted with sewage going down to the water  that you need to walk through to get to some of the restaurants. the bean bags at the beach was nice with a great atmosphere its just the sewage that killed is for our romantic walk   
Janeymc24,Offaly ,Jul 2016,Lovely to watch the surfers. Nice beach to walk on/swim in. Not a whole pile of cafes around for food. Sun loungers were very expensive. 
Sharon G,"Whyalla, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nice spot to start at and walk your little legs of for as far as the eye can see...sunsets are nice, lots of people very busy spot if you like lots tourists..."
Steve D,"Peyia, Cyprus",Jul 2016,"We spent the day here, great flat beach with plenty of beds.Cost of beds is about RP 100 for the day.Plenty of restaurants and toilets located along the beach, and lots of hawkers selling stuff.Also worth spending the evening here."
Tashaj31,"Pacific Coast Australia, Australia",Jul 2016,Seminyak Beach perfect for that stunning sunset shot. The  afternoons are busy with locals and visitors alike strolling the shore; swimming; surfing; or stopping off at the many hotel bars situated along the beachfront. Caution big strong surf during the day.  
chewy_candy,Jakarta,Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is always my fav because the flat sand and beautiful waves.  Not as many local sellers wander around as in Kuta. 
Allison F,11 contributions,Jul 2016,Too many tourists and people selling you things every 10min... Not recomended for a nap... You wont sleep much ^^
ujjwal41190,gurgaon,Mar 2016,not great for surfing..quiet place to relax.. I prefer Kuta (More people around) beach when it comes to surfing. 
Subiac0inni,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,At first I was not expecting too much as I am more of a swimmer than a surfer. Turns out renting a body surf board and just playing with the waves like the kids. Nice waves and water is not too deep. 
Always-travelling890,28 contributions,Jun 2016,I think a solution to the pollution running into the beach needs to be addressed. At times the beach really smells of sewage.
Flyholiday50,"Fethiye, Turkey",Jul 2016,Grabbed 2 beds and a umbrella from one of the many available. Paid 100k idr each which is double what we paid in Legian. Same sand same sea and surf but less crowded. Beer available from beach guy at 30k idr with stubby holder. Nice day had.
Jenjo2222,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2016,pleasant beach but it was just after they had a king tide come through so not much of the sand to be seen
MeeshellB,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,"Great place to come to relax enjoy a drink and watch the sunset. Numerous places to sit. I like the comfortable beanbags. Very casual relaxed atmosphere. Good for couples, families or in groups. Very inexpensive. "
DijohnWiltshire,"Salisbury, UK",Jul 2016,Had lunch at one of the restaurants on the beach which was ok. Obviously not suitable for swimming or really small children because of the waves which are used predominantly by surfers
Alba L,"Rivoli, Italy",Jul 2016,It was the nearest beach to the villa I rented it. Around Bali there are many beautiful  or passable . If you want to practice surf  they are suited to many  at south of the island .
Mo T,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2016,This is a great stretch of beach. Pretty clean and lots of great bars and restaurants if you walk back towards the airport. Well worth a visit. Good local food vendors at the end of the carpark catering to locals but happy to feed the hoards as well.
Marta B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"Clean and nice beach with coarse sand. Good for surfing, not too good to swim. A lot of nice places to get a fresh fruit juice at an amazing price. I enjoyed sunsets on the beach."
slatz1,"Rockingham, Australia",Jul 2016,Last day in Bali spent the afternoon at the beach. Few Bintangs and we hired a few body boards $5 aud each for unlimited use. Kids absolutely loved it. Wish we had spent more time there
Pramod50th,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,Seminyak Beach was a great place to remember . It was a very broad view of the scenic beauty all around & beautiful sun set to watch with many colours of the sky...really unforgettable ...loved it....
JulesnDan,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2016,So much rubbish on the sand here :(  not pretty.  There is also a construction site there atm  which makes it noisy and smelly.  Great market food though and lots of palm squirrels!
Grace GM,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"By Australian standards Seminyak beach is not the most beautiful beach you will see, in fact far from it.  The sand is grey and not attractive.  If there has been rain or storms there is rubbish on the beach.  The atmosphere in the afternoon and evening though is great with lots of beachfront bars, colourful bean bags and music.  Surf looked great but quite scary.  Not sure about the water quality but have been told it's not that clean."
Sergio P,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2016,Strong waves and currents so be careful when coming with kids! Best area is around La Plancha Beach Bar and Restaurant! Nice ambiance for sunset!
Jennifer,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Nice beach. It had rained for a few days when we first arrived so the beach was not great. Once the weather cleared the beach was less polluted and better for swimming. 
Darryl N,"Western Australia, Australia",Jul 2016,Firstly. Bali beaches are not a patch on beaches in Esperance Western Australia. Or even most Aussie Beaches for that matter. Now having said that it nice to sit and watch a sunset and drink a cold Bintang on the beach. And yes rubbish regularly washes up from Java with the water currents and on bad days they get tractors in to clean the beach. But in general a must thing to do is sit and relax and enjoy your holiday.
PocahontasTraveler,"Huntsville, AL",Aug 2015,The public beach is nice and there are a variety of restaurants!  You seem to need to purchase something to get a chair - but you can bring your own blanket and rest on the beach for free!
TCDHK,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,Nice beach on Bali with many top Hotels lining it. Friendly locals on the beach selling things and teaching you to surf.
Khun Fierman,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"A MUST IN BALI!Beautiful sunsets, clean beach and awesome vibe, with great bars and restaurants on the beach front. Another thing the waves is also nice. Good timing to come here around 5 pm. Bring along your mat and swimwears. Love this beach! "
catherine w,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2016,"Great beach day and night .Really good experience to walk along before sunset and find a good spot to sit and have a drink or two whilst looking at the  sun going down .Everyone goes down to the beach on a Sunday night to see the sunset , all the locals aswell as tourists and in the Indonesian school holidays it is jammed pack .Make sure you organize a good meeting spot if meeting up with friends as wifi and telephone reception is sometimes impossible to receive on the beach at busy times .Enjoy the beach its fabulous "
jassese,New Zealand,Jul 2016,"The water is lovely and warm and the photos posted show a beach paradise with gorgeous sunsets.  There is no question that Bali does have places like this but the shoreline from Kuta all the way up to Canggu has a terrible rubbish problem which comes off the streets and out via the streams.  I do not want to bag Bali as we have had a lovely time and the locals are amazing but do not come to Bali thinking it is pristine clean. I am not joking when I say you should make sure you have had your tetanus and Hep A shots if you plan on surfing or playing around the beach.  Bali is not unique, and this problem can be found all around SE Asia but it does not make it right.  If you are into surfing be prepared for the busy spots at peak holiday times."
Elín I,11 contributions,Jun 2016,Nice and clean beach with good restaurants and bars.Not recommended for swimming due to strong waves. Great for surfing and sunbathing.
traveladdict84304,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"This beach is not clean at all. The best beaches I have been to are in Esperance WA and the Whitsundays in Qld so I guess I have been spoiled. It's definitely  worth seeing for the culture though. Lots of places to eat, bands to listen to and things to do. "
Raka Mery H,Sweden,Jul 2016,"Easy for commuters, safe place for children to play , and many restaurant . I recommend to come to Sate Bali Seminyak at Kayu Aya Village, the food there was very great and nice service, Best for lunch and especially dinner after having a great time at the beach :)"
donmilmine,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2016,After taking hotel transfer to beach we were disgusted with the amount of rubbish lying around.  Beach actually closed for swimming!  Unfortunately local people do not appreciate how they are destroying their beautiful island with their (mainly plastic bag) rubbish.
fiona d,"Sidney, Canada",Jul 2016,"the beach was beautiful and easy to find nearest restaurant there, I recomended you to come to Sate Bali Restauran in Kayu Aya Village (near Flea Market) the food and treat was amazing, the JOGLO concept and wooden view are amazing..."
kevin l,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"Nice beach to watch the sunset, good surfing with some giant barrel's. On low tide the beach side restaurants and bars spill out onto the beach with beanbags, table's, umbrella's and sunbeds. Nice for a cold drink and a cool vibe but it gets very crowded.Watch out for several smelly stormwater/sewage? outlets that spill over the beach on the way to the ocean."
Alinta B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach itself is a gorgeous beach - wide clean beach with rolling surf (of various degrees).  It is bordered by big name hotels and restaurants, and some smaller places.  Sunset is gorgeous - morning is beautiful. "
Jas S,3 contributions,Jul 2016,"A MUST IN BALI.Beautiful sunsets and awesome vibe, with great bars and restaurants on the beach front.Go to La Plancha, great music amazing Tapas topped with nice drinks and comfy bean bags to chill on and watch the sunset."
Julie-Anne L,2 contributions,Jun 2016,This beach is not as nice as Sanur beach and it is very hard to access without going through one of the major hotels along the beach as there is limited access points. 
chyi,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,Good swells for surf enthusiasts. Walking distances to eateries and shops along multiple points in Seminyak. 
MasumMS,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jun 2016,"Confession: I only went there for the sunset, so don't know how it looks or how busy it is during daytime. For the sunset, it was not very busy, but there were enough people there not to make it feel deserted. Colorful restaurants with a lot of beanbags are there to enjoy the sunset from. I particularly enjoyed the walk on the beach away from the cafes after it got a bit dark."
Annaliese L,"Newlands, South Africa",Jul 2016,We lived spending time here both for swimming as well as having a party at night. Try to ignore the ever present traders or chat to them to find out about their lives ... . They are always friendly. The best time is at sunset when ons can sip cocktails and listen to live music 
Emma L,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"This beach is lovely, but very crowded! If you want to sit around with many other tourists and locals, this is the place for you! "
Anne M,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,Seminyak beach is great for renting a beach chair for the afternoon and lying back. Drinks can be purchased at the many beach shack Cafes along the beach. Enjoy the warmth in the middle of the Australian winter! 😊
Brandie,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2016,"We're staying at the W, so I can only speak of the beach around that area. I noticed some small ""rivers"" coming from hotels that kids were playing in, walked through it and realized it was sewage. Pretty gross and made me not want to be on the beach anymore. I'm not sure why anyone would think that was okay! People swim in there, gross all around. The sand is black from volcanoes, which is pretty cool to me. The waves were thrashing and not safe at all to get it, but pretty to look at. Also, it's pretty annoying to have people always trying to sell you something. I get people need to make money, but no one even carries money when they are swimming and if they do, they're not wanting to buy cheap stuff like that. Maybe get better stuff and be more subtle."
jenny s,"Portland, OR",Jun 2016,"The beach was really dirty when we were there. I'm not sure why they don't pay people to cleanup the beachfront, even the hotels don't clean up in their beaches out front."
AussieMike,"Acton Park, Australia",Jun 2016,"We have visited Seminyak beach twice - and have been twice too often! We are spoiled  with pristine white sand beaches at home - so the black volcanic sand just doesnt do it for us - further the sand is all hard packed down, and the ocean regularly claims victims .To top it off it is crowded with sun loving drunkards and locals selling all manner of tourist targeted products/services."
Ruth S,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2016,"Seminyak beach is great for a morning stroll or for lazing with a book at La Lucciola,but don't go with the expectation that it will take your breath away.It's pretty in an understated way but not a once-in-a-lifetime beach experience."
663Mal,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nice beach, better than Seminyak itself. Can find a quiet place away from others. Watch for dangerous currents."
misscol,Waterford,Jun 2016,"Please be careful at this beach, we saw two people being rescued.Great surf, both watching and partaking in surfing. There were two rivers of raw sewage running into the ocean up the beach - the absolutely stink. "
Donna F,5 contributions,Jun 2016,Gawjus beach to go for a stroll  clean  very picturesque fantastic sunset well worth a visit for a stroll or a swim
Kathleen20012014,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,"Enjoyed getting away as we were able to get get BC flights and the CourtYard Marriott for a great price, but although the hotel was lovely, its more for families no quite areas.  It rained 4 out of the 6 days.  The beach spot for the hotel is too far away nea The Library on Seminyak beach.  Bali used to rain then a couple of hours and then its fine, not the case anymore. I have to say all the prices have gone up, but its still a great place.   Massages are still dirt cheap, together with Taxi and all in all the food is really of a high standard.  Plus no sickness at all.  I love Bali so in kind og bias as ive been going for so many years.  Seminyak is great shopping food and accommodation, what more can you ask for? Well nice weather would have been nice ...happy holidays!"
Anda H,"Ghimbav, Romania",Jul 2016,"We went yesterday at the public beach, via the Ku De Ta beach club. The sand is nice, the beach is clean, the chairs for relaxing in the sun are ok, bring your own towels and sit back enjoy the ocean. The water was perfect, hot , cool waves, had a lot of fun in the water. A perfect day at the beach. There are a lot of comerciants coming by, asking if you want to buy all kinds of things, fruits, watches, scarves, etc. Enjoy!"
Wendy G,"Box Hill, Australia",Jun 2016,"I'm not sure how this beach only gets four stars! Sure it's not an Australian beach but it's beautiful in its own right. A great way to walk from one location to another, always something to look at from the peanut seller, to the people hawking their wares (almost always politely), the beachside bars and restaurants, kids and families enjoying the water, day beds to settle in for the long haul of a tough day at the beach, people fishing and completely glorious sunsets."
JaneP08,"Dalyan, Turkey",Aug 2015,Lovely beach which is clean and well-maintained. Great vibe at the bars/hotels on the edge of the beach. Sunsets are stunning! Watch out in the hotels ... drinks are pricey!
Eveline K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Along the beach, there are many cafe with the live music and you can relax with your family and friends watching the sun goes down...oh...so happy"
Gabbster8,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2016,The beach is long and is great for a walkAnd superb for sunset. Of course it would be better without the sellers. If you walk south a couple of km you will be in Kuta which is full of annoying sellers. The more north you head you find great bars and restaurants on the beach.The long rolling waves are exquisite and it is no wonder it is famous for surfing. There are many rips which make swimming dangerous. Great to be in a hotel or bar overlooking this beach. 
Shane D,4 contributions,Jun 2016,"I enjoyed a walk along the beach , I was surprised how clean it was as when I was there previously in january a few years ago it was full of rubbish ."
rubyjude57,"Bendigo, Australia",Jun 2016,"First time on the beach after the rain, clean and lots of great waves. Hired sun beds from a beautiful family. Fresh coconut milk, massage and manicure..heaven the beach vendors were not too pushy either"
Sandra K,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Jun 2016,nothing like the australian beaches - quite dirty - maybe from the high tides - shopping strip was good
littlelipstickliv,17 contributions,Jan 2016,One of the most beautiful sunsets I've ever seen. Gorgeous beach with flawless views and lovely atmosphere
Pamela P,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,Fantastic surfing lessons with Made.  The children really excelled and were so happy.  Will return for more lessons and fun.
Margaret W,"Motherwell, UK",Jun 2016,"My favourite part of the holiday was sitting on the beach watching the magical sunsets.  Various bars line the beach, most have live music and excellent food.It was amazing!"
Elaine C,5 contributions,Jun 2016,"Manage to get a seat at 11am on tue morning. dont take reservations so do go early. food is good ordered the eggs bennedict and wrap, didnt like polenta fries though very bland? the juices are ok coffee soso, go for food instead"
Thaitimes,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"This beach has great surf and plenty of sun lounges for sale at a hefty price unless you are prepared to bargain. I'm unsure of the water quality but it was warm without being a bath.  Don't come here expecting white sands and blue water as you will be terribly disappointed. The tide was strong so I'm not sure I would take young children here.  There does not seem to be lifeguards around.  I guess I am spoiled by having some of the best beaches in the world at my doorstep in Australia. Anyhow, the surfers seemed to enjoy it."
DniDubh,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"This is a huge beach with a great selection of bars and surf board rentals. The waves are great for surfers or those who just wish to chill out. Sun beds and parasols can be rented cheaply. Sarong and souvenir sellers are a little tiresome. Pollution is a massive problem, especially during the rainy season. There is a sign that says it is a 'natural phenomenon', which is a complete lie. The rubbish is because of inadequate trash collection infrastructure and poor education and awareness about littering. Hopefully the situation will improve given recent campaigns on the island."
John M,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Seminyak attracts the higher end client with the larger resorts. But I find the beach to be dirty and smelly due the many creeks that flow into the ocean there. Nearby Legian in much cleaner.
Journeyfamily,"Western Australia, Australia",Jun 2016,"Every second person we passed were trying to sell us surfing lessons or deck chairs. I understand they are trying to make a living but I guess if you are looking for a relaxing stroll, this is not the place. Sand looked abit dirty and grey as well (maybe it was the weather? Was overcast). Otherwise, saw some big waves and people surfing. Wouldn't advise little ones. Lots of restaurants etc as well but they were closed when we were there (afternoon). "
Bossy24,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jun 2016,"So much fun to watch the goings on. Surfing for learners, easy peasy, lessons and boards available for rent beachside.Grab a beanbag at a bar 5.00pm onwards to watch the sunset and the kites flying overhead.  Whatever the roving vendors try and sell you offer less than half, to get to halfway. They will come down as you go up. Enjoy the bargaining and don't be mean."
Wes B,"Richmond, Canada",Jun 2016,During low tide this beach is great for the kids to play. You still have to be cautious though... we enjoyed lounging in our sun chairs while the kids collected shells and played.
cherylwoodson,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Seminyak has become overdeveloped like Kuta and Legain.  It's good for shopping, watching sunset and spending time a bars& cafes.  There are nicer beaches in the north west corner of Bali.  The beaches a bit further away are a lot nice"
Syantie,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jun 2016,A lil bit far away from main street. About 15-20 mins drive from Sunset Rd depend on traffict.But it worth when you can catch sunset thereNot as hustle bustle as Kuta Beach
Arrigo B,"Milton, MA",Jun 2016,"We went for a stroll before sunset, so maybe we missed the key feature of this beach. We liked the setting, nice sand and we didn't noticed anything dirty, as reported by other reviewers. Zero approaches from beach vendors. Nice little temple in the back, which unfortunately we were not able to visit for inappropriate clothing.  Bars are everywhere: nothing uber-neat, just comfortable beanbags and lounge chairs. Rentals and surfing lessons. Overall, nice beach, seen better. "
veganrr,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2016,Quite a rough beach even during low tide. If you're looking for calm beaches then head to Sanur. This one is for the surfers.
Papartynas,"Glasgow, UK",May 2016,"Nice and clean. Not too busy, beach chairs as lottery- 1st day for 4 we paid 300k, next day 150K. Try to stay in same place, same fella so will get better price. Lifeguard was on duty , waves too big- telling to everyone get out from water- Perfect."
Jim B,Whittlesea,Jun 2016,Variety of eateries and bars catering for all tastes and budgets. Sunset viewing from the bean bags probably a must do - but was peeing down the night we attempted - so viewed from a bar/restaurant with bintang in hand!
Mike T,"Caroline Springs, Australia",Jun 2016,"Stunning beach and perfect place to start a walk from Seminyak all the way to Kuta if your up for it or the other way around. Takes about an hour to get from Legian to Seninyak at a reasonably slow pace enjoying the surroundings which include locals playing soccer, lanterns, bean bags, musicians, beach bar after beach bar and many many other things to see and take it all in. "
R_Sweden,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jun 2016,"Very big and lively bech. Huge waves, perfect for surfers. You can hire surf lessons and gear every 10 meter. Lots of places to have a drink in the fantastic sunsets. Nice mixture of locals, tourists, dogs and everything else! "
ryandonoghue3,"Leeds, UK",Jun 2016,"If you are in Seminyak you absolutely must take in the sunset at Seminyak beach. On a clear day the view of the sunset beyond the crashing waves was one of the most beautiful sights I have ever seen. Just be aware, my partner and I went to the beach hoping to sunbathe and learn to surf, neither of which were possible as sunbathing isn't permitted on the majority of the beach (as you would be laid in front of one of the beach-side bars); also the waves are huge so swimming isn't allowed and I wouldn't surf unless you know what you're doing."
TrippingDuud,"Amsterdam, NY",Jun 2016,"Cool and relaxed beach with a nicer vibe than kuta beach. Still the same amount of merchants but more places with bean bags and music to chill. Waves are more lenghty than kuta as well, though it depends on the time i guess"
SweetPeaAdventures,"Pineville, NC",May 2016,"Best part of the beach was sunset. From our hotel, we could walk for 10 minutes and be in Seminyak beach where all the umbrella/beanbag restaurants were.  (Beanbag beach)  It was definitely pretty to see, and a good place to catch the sunset, but make sure you get a seat in the middle.  We unfortunately got seated in the front beanbag chairs and were harassed by hawkers all evening long.  Made for an unpleasant experience in what would of otherwise been a beautiful sunset experience. "
wawalover,Waarland,Jun 2016,To much dirt unfortunately. But still beautifull because of the heavy waves. Only Oberoi hotel has a nice and clean beachpart!
holiday_cruising62,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2016,"We has a very relaxing day on the beach , plenty things to see and watch the world walk by. Nice day highly recommend visiting Seminyak beach .."
AmyHickson,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,We have been to Bali many times but always stay in Nusa Dua or Ubud. We decided to finally check out Seminyak as it certainly draws some crowds. We entered the beach area and immediately weren't impressed. The beach was dirty and it smelt disgusting like sewerage we didn't even want to take our flip flops off. Having walked only a couple hundred meters we turned around and left the beach to get away from the smell. The furnishings along the beach where also very run down and in need of an upgrade with the beach umbrellas and chairs faded and ripped. 
snake43,"Victoria, Australia",Jun 2016,"great place to be for sunset, great cafe's, great bands good vibe about this place, pull up a bean bag and just watch the world go bye"
Ulf S,"Umeå, Sweden",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach is wide and the sand is firm, perfect to walk on. Both the beach and the water is clean. However, it is quite big waves, great for surfers but not great for kids."
Dugg0,"Shepparton, Australia",Jun 2016,We went here for tea on a number of occasions as there are heaps of restaurants along the beach to choose. The surf does vary heaps so like any beach to keep an eye on kids and other family members.  There are heaps of hawkers that ply their trade along the beach so just say no and then continue to sip away on that Bintang and they move on!!!
NatalieAdelaide,Adelaide,Jun 2016,"So many beach bars and restaurants, all with a great vibe and friendly staff.  Comfy bean bags on the beach, or table and chairs inside the restaurant.  Your choice."
Thomas C,"Paris, France",Jun 2016,"Seminyak beach is not as crowded as kuta. Definitely a good choice if traveler want a less crowded and not noisy beach. There are people that rent beach chair for 200k/hour. Try to negotiate the price, 200k is to expensive especially for domestic tourist. Overall the place is quite good especially at night."
A J,"Hobart, Australia",Jun 2016,"This is a typical tourist hot spot beach in Bali.  Hire a longe and watch the world go by, or more likely come to you to purchase everything you may need on the beach, hats, food drinks and even a kite! The waves can be pretty big so take care and don't forget the sunscreen.  Beachside restaurants are many and vary in style and price."
Maree H,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2016,"During day not too many hawkers, easier to swim compared to Kuta and surf is great for learners. At nighttime the place is surreal and you get incredible food and pictures as it turns into an Ibiza with a sea of beanbags, musicians, and food and booze. "
travelminions,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2016,The beach is extremely long. The wave is so strong that it's twice as high as an adult height. Should be a good place for surfing. A nice spot to see sunset. We saw a couple taking pre-wedding shoot on the beach. Probably not private enough for sun bathing. Not is a safe place for leisure swimming due to the strong wave. Sand looks pretty dark but feel soft and powdery on feet. 
Neatesy,193 contributions,Jun 2016,"Great place to say goodnight to the sun after a sunny hot day..sitting in bean bags listening to live music, sipping on cold cocktails and beer feeling like the world you left behind is miles away...."
mikeyp3,"Bath, UK",Jun 2016,The beach is relatively quiet with lots of room to walk and occasional places to eat or just sit and have a drink. The sea is generally safe. 
Lee M,48 contributions,Jun 2016,Great location close by many amenities in Seminyak. Worth a visit especially if you like a surf. Nice sand to relax on and certainly worth a paddle. 
Mark M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Great to relax in the evening to watch sunsets whilst enjoying a meal or having a drink.Most offer entertainment and really large beanbags to slouch in.You will be bombarded by people selling trinkets but they soon move on if you don't pay any attention.
Marzee29,"Caroline Springs, Australia",Jun 2016,great views for a great sunset.....very colourful with all the lounges and umbrellas and the music is good too...sit back and relax with a cocktail and watch the sun go down...magicial
Raj G,368 contributions,Jun 2016,"The seminyak beach is one of he best in Bali for surfing lovers , sunsets lovers and beach side restaurant lovers ! The water is tho' not clear and clean for a bath but still better than many beaches in Bali . "
leemE1734ST,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"Its hard to get to from the main road, unless you want to walk through Potato Head (careful as your water is taken off you)"
kunjie17,4 contributions,Jun 2016,"Had a hard time finding the entrance to the beach from the main road as the resorts were lining the stretch between the road and the beach. No clear signages for us to locate entrance as well. We finally backtracked for 4 mins and found a small entrance through Ke De Ta. Coconut was very fresh and cooling which was a big plus for a hot afternoon. But sunbed had to be haggled with the vendors (there were many of them along the beach) and we got a pair of beds at 50,000IDR for an hour. The beach was clean and nice to walk along the edge of the waves along the shoreline. It wasn't too crowded and was overall an enjoyable experience! would go back again"
Peter Maccormick oam,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Pity the beach is  not clean with a lot of Rubbish some no doubt caused by the storm but there appears that'd the locals make no effort to tidy it up !!
Beach Bum B,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2016,The beach at Seminyak is gorgeous. Not nearly as noisy or busy as Kuta beach and offers all that and more. The waves there are more gentle and the water seems warmer. Sun beds and umbrellas are available for renting. The beach is broad and sandy and sandy and stretches for many km's in either direction.
janineh165,"Ballarat, Australia",Jun 2016,"Coloured beanbags & umbrellas line the sand, The food at the restaurants on the beach is wonderful, a great place to kick back, unwind with a drink and enjoy stunning sunsets."
David & Tricia,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"When you walk onto the main beach of Kuta, Legain or Seminyak they all offer similar things, beach lounges, cold beer & umbrellas but the exception is Seminyak it has more atmosphere with a lot of eateries along the beach.Ps. A great way to walk between Kuta, Legian & Semiyan is along the beach or the back streets close to the beach."
GavinJohn59,"Fingal, Australia",May 2016,"with all the hundreds of millions of dollars that come  into Bali surely they could upgrade the most filthiest, vile, disgusting toilets that we have ever been into, they probably a hundred years old and have never been cleaned and they have the cheek to charge you   lift your game Indonesia "
Benvantaylor,"Manchester, UK",Jun 2016,"I'm here now on the beach in Seminyak chilling listening to the waves. The beach is very relaxed with plenty of beds to choose from. It costs about £10 for 2 beds for the day and a btl of water is about 50p. There is plenty of food places along the beach to grab a snack, they are OK for a sandwich and drink.The sea at the moment is quite rough so be careful, the waves don't look that big but when your underneath it, it's a very different story. It is however very warm so that's a plus point. If you want to learn to surf you can do which also is cheap. The people along the beach are very friendly and we had a foot massage yesterday from Kitty who was very good, she painted my toe nails very nice also. There is lots of sellers down the beach, they mean no harm just trying to earn a living they all have hats with their names on and some stuff is ok what they are selling. I like this place because everyone is welcome and nobody cares what you look like. It's not like Cancun where you have to make an effort to go to the beach. At night the beach bars have live music where you can watch the sunset, very relaxing.❤️"
hrishi2016,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",May 2016,Semiyank beach is very clean and beautiful and offers a nice view of the sunset. There are a number of bars on the beach.
Candice B,42 contributions,Jun 2016,Had a lovely time at the beach but the prices of food and drinks in the area are steep! Had to drive 10 minutes on the scooters to find food under 50 IDR
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,"You can get great food ,and have a drink, while sitting on a beanbag and watching the sun go down, Very relaxing way to start your evening."
JennyJ52,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"Beaches are great, restaurants fabulous, bean bags all along the beach to sit and enjoy and drink or two."
Ma-manators,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,Took a stroll to the beach after breakfast. Short walk away from our hotel but it was easy to locate. Great atmosphere and good location for surfing!
tiffanydeborah,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Jun 2016,Many bars and beach clubs along the beach. Loved the beach as it is in general rather clean. It has beautiful and fun waves especially for surfers! 
feliciagraciouz,"Angers, France",Jun 2016,"It's always active, I mean crowded.. Even in the nighttime..However, with the low light in the night, you can still feel the romantic ambiance..Sitting in the bean bags and have 'some' mojito 😉You can also light up a sky lantern, there usually are some guys who walk along the beach to sell for IDR 90k.."
Jack W,38 contributions,Jun 2016,Very busy huge waves so very good for surfers but no good for those who want to chill out and have a swim. Sand is black. Beach very busy with poor quality restaurants selling overpriced food and drinks. I wouldn't go back to this beach - much nicer ones only a short moped journey away. 
Manish K,46 contributions,Jun 2016,I visited the beach with my family on morning and was surprised to find it dirty. Not expected such standard fron bali beaches. It was stinking as sewage was entering sea from one of the places. One can go to other beaches. Not recommended at all
Glen D,"Mumbai, India",May 2016,Got there early to avoid the sun and found the beach deserted with a few blokes going through their fitness regime.
Kylie_fnqphotography,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2016,"Beautiful beach, has a really nice little bar with an awesome view. Great place to go for a walk and watch the sun go down. The local people are all very friendly. "
Julien P,"Boulogne-Billancourt, France",Jun 2016,"The beach here is quite dirty, smells like sewers at times. I would not recommend you are better off by staying at the good bars and resorts with swimming pools in front"
Hussein I,"Beirut, Lebanon",Jun 2016,Lovely sunset... but waves are just too high to enjoy a swim. You can simply walk down the beach romantic view. But most beaches are dirty since waves are high... drafts more garbage to the shore. 
Bella C,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",May 2016,"What a wonderful beach to walk along especially at sunset & people watch! There are models in wedding dresses ankle deep in water or mounted on ponies, people swimming or surfing, people rod fishing, flying kites, playing football, drinking cocktails at the endless strip of beach bars & on it goes!"
graham a,3 contributions,Jun 2016,Loved the clean waves. Walking distance to beach clubs. No beach hustlers like kuta beach. We enjoyed a cold beer from Potato Head.
SabHei,3 contributions,Jun 2016,The beachside of Seminyak was beautiful and rounded our holiday up. With many activities and restaurants it has something for every taste.
Tayla A,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"This beach is great to watch the sunset and sit at one of the many beachside bars and restaurants. Most of them have cushions and beanbags to sit at and enjoy the beach views. The beach is clean but watch out for your belongings as this place has a reputation for pickpocketing. There are a lot of people on the beach trying to sell you things. It's best to bargain the price at least to 50% and definitely say no if you don't want it because they are very pushy. Other than that, this beach is great for the whole family. "
Andre N,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2015,Pantai yang cantik cuma terlalu ramai. Probably kerna saya dan teman-teman ke sana pas malam New Year. We had fun its just that hujan renyai-renyai buat rasa kurang enak. But the party went on until late of course.Seminyak is a definite beach to visit when you are in Bali. Looove it. Will definitely come back.
Dasmesh Singh B,116 contributions,Jun 2016,"High waves, can't really swim but it's beautiful to just visit. Alot of people thou. Other beaches like nusa dua and jimbaran are more beautiful calm and nice to go into the water."
wwstraveler,"Seattle, WA",Apr 2016,"Beach was ok but nothing special.  Felt dirty. I am sure the sunsets are awesome, we were here in the morning., "
Rahul J,"Varanasi District, India",May 2016,The beach is very famous among the locals. It was very much crowded. No water sports at the beach...
NolaEng,"Malvern, Australia",May 2016,"As always this is a fabulous stretch of beach that offers loads of fun, surf and relaxation. You can choose a cafe and sit in the comfy beanbag seats, order an ice cold Bintang, even a snack and listen to the music of choice. The best..is to sit on the beach and watch the amazing sunsets or go for a walk in the early morning and watch the sun come up."
Mark B,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2016,"The beach like all beaches in Asia does have some local rubbish on it, but most mornings local contractors do clean up the majority of it.The water quality is good and the surf break quite large."
Mary Neville,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2016,"Seminyak beach had some wonderful views, and from a distance was picturesque. Upon further inspection, however, there was a rather obnoxious smell that, whilst initially unforthcoming, I found to be more apparent the closer I reached to the water..it was at this point I realized swimming would be a poor choice. Other tourists didn't seem to mind, so if you're adventurous at heart-by all means, have a gander! "
Sharnee H,8 contributions,Jun 2016,"Great place to visit with the kids, I even managed to get around with my double stroller. Restaurants are a lil bit pricy for a family if comparing to the rest of Bali. "
Jacqueline M,79 contributions,Jun 2016,We were at Double Six beach two days back as compared to that Seminyak Beach was much cleaner and quieter. You won't be harassed too much by vendors. I like Seminyak Beach better.
Melanie J,"Norah Head, Australia",May 2016,"Not very clean beach unfortunately. Hoping to get a surf and relax, but not much relaxing with locals trying to sell you there items and beach crowded with learn to surf schools"
Rebecca V,Lake Macquarie Australia,May 2016,"I struggle to think of anything nice to say about Seminyak beach but as I hate negative reviews I'll try to be objective;Pros: Plenty of dining options/beach clubs. Plenty of nearby accommodation. Cons: Ugly beach - black sand. Far nicer beaches to be found elsewhere in Bali, even Kuta is much prettier. I would not visit again Seminyak Beach again."
xronis,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"waters warm not my type but great for learning to surf as this is really shallow. good for kids and family , be careful with the sun as its black sand"
Jo C,London,May 2016,"What a lovely  beach, long and sandy. Safe bathing as long as you take note of the flag colours. Quite  awesome surf. Sun set is a fantastic sight from beach. If fit you can walk along the waters edge all the way  to Cuta beach."
Johannes V,9 contributions,May 2016,"Clean than Kuta but not as nice as Jimbaran Beach.. Waves are good for surfers, but make swimming dangerous"
Sam G,15 contributions,May 2016,"Not the best beach I've been too but it's OK bit choppy for me, there are toilets on the back of the beach and also food and drink stalls and it's very cheap, women come round the beach selling fresh fruit and cold drinks which is a bonus"
Vilks,39 contributions,Jun 2016,The ocean here is special with a kilometer of rolling surf tubes which can feed your soul for hours. Unfortunately the beach sand is filthy and grey water drains directly into the beach so risky to let kids play here.
Bseblgrl3,"Seattle, WA",May 2016,Wonderful beach to walk and warm water to wade in. The current is strong so be prepared to be pulled in by the lifeguard if you swim outside designated areas. Great for boogie boarding + surfing.
Fabian Y,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2016,This beach is not so crowded as compared to kuta. And it is a great place to view the sunset when happen around 6pm local time. There is a carpark and a few restuarants beside the beach.
jrnewson,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,We stayed at the Marriott Courtyard and used Seminyak beach as the hotel has a private facility with sun lounges. Generally all the beaches are clean and have bars and resturants attached which makes it very enjoyable.
Harley E,"Clear Island Waters, Australia",May 2016,"It's a lovely beach, with a great sunset. Lots of umbrellas and chairs to hire to stay out of the sun, some of the people selling get annoying  and a bit of rubbish but still really nice beach"
Ella C,240 contributions,May 2016,Such a great beach with a range of restaurants and seating to chose from! It's really nice to see that this beach is really well looked after! The sun loungers are a little expensive however if you are staying for the whole day it's well worth getting one with an umbrella too because that sun gets super hot! The sand is so nice and soft and looks like it sparkles! So many people out surfing and lots of places to hire a board for an hour or so!In the evening lots of beanbags are placed on the beach under really cute umbrellas and lots of lights. Definitely a nice spot to grab a drink and a bite to eat. Would recommend checking this beach out you won't be disappointed! 
Sue P,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Having a beer at sunset a magical place to beThe beach is a lot cleaner than it has been for a long time , great to watch the beach sellers go about their business"
JoffG,"London, UK",May 2016,Though views are great and you have some amazing waves some parts of the beach smell as if some sewage is dumped there. Better hope the wind blows in the right direction. 
samrox5,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"Great for viewing the sunset. Not for swimming, water cloudy & not that great. Plenty of surfers though & bars & restaurants. "
Katerinka S,2 contributions,Apr 2016,"good for surfing, i'm a beginner but met profi there too, also clean, but not that good for swimming, view is perfect! sunsets are very nice "
travellers7406,"Northamptonshire, UK",May 2016,"The beach is great except for the plastic! The beach guys do as much as they can to clear it up after the tides gone out but there's still so much. People should be soley employed to clean the beach and take the rubbish away. Helpful for the environment and it would provide employment.?With the amount of revenue that Bali is receiving from tourism, it's time for the Indonesian government to step up on the waste problem. The sea around Bali is heavily polluted with plastic. We saw three dead turtles whilst travelling in Indonesia, and were informed that the most common cause of a turtles premature death in those waters in due to ingesting plastic. Seminyak beach is covered in tiny pieces of plastic and polystyrene which ends up in marine life's stomachs. Which is wonderful for the local people who rely on fish for protein. We spoke to many fishermen who are outraged by this horrendous rubbish problem in the ocean. Playing in the waves you feel rubbish brushing past you and it's just not pleasant. One day we didn't even go in the sea as there was so much rubbish! There needs to be recycling facilities that are readily available and free for hotels in Seminyak and all of Bali. We saw local people raiding bins outside hotels for plastic bottles and cans, surely these could at least be left out for them!? We couldn't even find anywhere in Seminyak where we could refill our plastic water bottles. Human waste is also released into the sea all around Bali via the sewer pipes that go down the beach and out to sea.Also watch the current at Seminyak beach. Great for us surfing and body boarding but we also saw three separate occasions where life guards had to rescue people who had been taken out by the current. Great fun in the big waves but just be careful. "
lilliespearlzroses,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",May 2016,"So much fun, you rock up at night, find a bean bag and order a bintang!! Honestly just look around and get a vibe for spot that feels right to you."
NZ_yams,queenstown,May 2016,Big and spacious with plenty to offer. Great for sunsets too. Lots of touts but they are easily avoided. Brilliant space for children. 
Jony128,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",May 2016,"Seminyak beach is a city beach. Hence, you will not find a clear water and white sandy beach. However, it does offer a great swell and surfing waves for the surfers out there. For those people not used to beaches, it will be great. For those like me looking for outstanding beaches, consider Virgin Beach."
Ross&JessL,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Great at night time bands playing , bean bags to sit on listen to music , the quieter one is the coffee lounge sign on it I think it's capil beach restaurant our favourite on Tuesday Wednesday  , they all offer music and dinner it's nice to eat on the beach , move around to different ones see which one you like but great at night time "
Mar,"Zielona Gora, Poland",Jan 2016,"wide sandy beach, but unfortunately quite dirty; very expensive beach chairs and umbrellas - especially at the entrance to the beach"
Michelle M,"Blue Mountains, Canada",May 2016,"We stayed for 5 days at The Royal Beach Resort in Seminyak and it was absolutely perfect for us.  The area is very beautiful, the beaches are lovely and the water warm but very rough.  No swimming for 5 days but you could go in the surf and play close to shore.  It is quite touristy which we did not like...crowded, lots of people trying to sell you stuff all the time...whenever we left our resort, we were inundated with offers from vendors.  However our resort was like a slice of paradise...quiet, secluded, charming, authentic Balinese culture and food."
TiaKaiYen,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,"First time here, nice beach with manageable waves (ard 1pm, high tide)... Coz I can't really swim so strong waves are scary. Lovely weather, great for sun tanning. Lots of locals trying to sell handicrafts, common culture in Thai beaches too. Apparently they sell slightly more expensive than the shops, and definitely have to bargain to lower the prices. "
FloBotticelli,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2016,The beach is clean and the sunset is just awesome! Nature at its best.. The beautiful display of colours combined with the clouds is just breathtaking.
Alison S,"Dubai, Dubai, United Arab Emirates",May 2016,"Good bars for lively fun but might be too busy for those requiring a more relaxed atmosphere. Not far to walk to quieter beaches though, giving you options."
Wombler661,"Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2015,"The beach is a bit narrower than Legian + Double Six Beaches, however it backs onto some great spots where entertainment, food and drink are all well placed. "
AnaByn,"Makati, Philippines",May 2016,Great sunset and can visit and have a drink in the big hotels like Potato Head or W hotel!!! love this
Derek Y,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",May 2016,"Plenty of touts so just be careful on Seminyak Beach.After Kuta, I would say the Seminyak is the next busiest beachin Bali. A must to come to this beach to soak in the sea breeze and at the same time to experience all the beach side vendors.They sell anything ranging from Sarongs to Hats to Sunglasses.Some of the nice eateries found here are also a must try as they serve some very nice food at reasonable prices. "
Cassiijoy,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2016,There is nothing better than a sunset on Seminyak Beach - we had to do it several times.  Do yourself a favour.
Elaine A,"Taguig City, Philippines",Jan 2016,"Witnessed Bali sunset here in Seminyak, the place was a bit crowded but still nice. There are lots of restaurants and hotels near the area. "
Tony H,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,Much better than Kuta beach. A lot cleaner and not so crowded. The bean bag bars are fantastic which contributes to the atmosphere. Great for just a nice walk too. Don't miss this jewel.
Robert O,"Bangor, ME",May 2016,"Went to the beach which gets crowded around sunset.  The waves were huge, about eight to ten feet high.  The tide was going out and it was amazing how strong and long the tidal suction lasted...atleast twenty seconds.  The sand is light brown and there are plenty of beach chairs you can rent.  "
Aasiqui Y,3 contributions,May 2016,"so relaxerd, great service at the bars, not too expensive, you sit right up towards the beach, friendly atmosphere and great food too."
Steve W,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"The beach and attending cabana's and drink/food huts were terrific compared to 3 years ago.  The beach was always clean, the people (locals) very friendly and helpful.  The hire of the beach beds was very reasonable and at the right ones they even delivered your Bintang direct as you needed it.  We had a great few days down there during our stay."
CR5Vacations,"Montmorency, Australia",May 2016,Great surfFriendly beach lounge owners Constant interruptions from beach sellers a little annoying after a whileSand okWater a lovely temp (early May)
Andrew S,"Johannesburg, South Africa",May 2016,"This beach is a must for beach lovers. You can learn to surf of just swim in the waves for miles of beautiful beach and sea. Every afternoon, the beach is transformed into a magical atmosphere of bean bags and live music for you to enjoy magnificent sunsets. The prices are very reasonable and the service is good. A definite must. "
KAYLONDON88,"Stratford City, UK",May 2016,might have been because we went in a quite season but the atmosphere was calm and there was not much to do.
murrayjt,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,It was a change for us to go to a more quieter part of bali. eat street was good plenty to choose from.shopping not a big thing with me enough though for my wife.
Hans Frederik B,"Stavanger, Rogaland, Norway",May 2016,"Much better than Kuta beach, and the sellers are less nagging. Nice restaurants by the beach and nice personell."
Mick S,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Lots of quality improvements in relation to the water and beach over recent years.  The after dark scene is amazing. Such great restaurants where you get to sit in bean bags and eat and drink.  Live bands play - acoustic sets mainly and it has a real friendly vibe. This is your over 30s beach.  Safe. Clean and drug free.
Starbelly B,36 contributions,May 2016,"The water looked pretty dirty and the sand wasn't great. I've seen worse but I've also seen much, much better. I personally wouldn't bother swimming here and I'd be dubious about sticking my head under water. Having said that, it's not unpleasant to go for a walk along."
Joy M,327 contributions,Mar 2016,"Eh, I don't hate this beach. I love the little evening local market that pops up near the public parking lot. But the beach can be kinda dirty. But it's way better than Kuta!"
malexandral,"Cranbrook, Canada",May 2016,We've had some great days just lazing in the sun! They have great food at the little restaurants in the evening for watching the sun set. Let's of trinket vendors if you don't feel like shopping for the people back home but you have to get them 'something'! They also have grilled corn in the parking lots and coconuts for drinking for the perfect beach pictures!
Kristine V,"Grimstad, Norway",May 2016,"Beach it self is really nice but we got so annoyed with those sellers! Has a lot of places where to sit, have a drink and watch sunset."
Marno S,34 contributions,May 2016,"Soft sand, great waves, relaxed atmosphere.Sunset is great with few drinks, music and a bean bag...Beach is clean and feels safe at night              "
Sole L,9 contributions,May 2016,"If you have been to good beaches in Australia, this one is very average. Unless your surfing. Go to Nusa Dua. Dirty sand and big waves here."
Caitlin G,84 contributions,May 2016,"One of the cleanest beaches among Kuta/Legian etc. The hotels are more up market and take pride in the cleanliness of the beach outside of their establishments. There are always waves, people and sun beds to rent. The weather never disappoints and a picturesque sunset will be seen on most nights. If in the area, it is definitely worth a visit."
Heather V,"Mackay, Australia",Apr 2016,"great place to enjoy the sunset, and grab a cheap meal from one of the many 'restaurant"" on the beach "
Chimanlal P,"Harrow, UK",May 2016,The beach has brown and black Sand..good for surfing as waves are strong. There are many places on the beach plus the drinks
ever0d,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,"Sunny Seminyak Beach, we were lucky to have some very nice waves during our time there, it can be a busy beach, with plenty of people, surf boards, beach lounges and umbrellas, but there is still plenty of room to relax.  Watch the sunset in the evening from the bean bags on the beach or the cafes on the beach best place to be around 5pm."
Pegasus1129,Jakarta,May 2016,"Excellent place to hang out with family or friends especially when you chasing the sunset. The view always perfect in Seminyak area, nice lounge music from cheap to expensive cafe.nice environment and hundreds of good restaurant."
Maureen T,"Townsville, Australia",Apr 2016,"We arrived at Seminyak Beach mid afternoon in a cab, it was easy to access as we had been sick for a few days. The scene was magic, beautiful ocean & weather, we hired a couple of lazy boys to lay on for the time we were there & the beach was busy. Then came the hawkers selling their goods,  we were sorry we bought the first item from them, we were harassed by them for quite some time"
09Realist,"Bunbury, Australia",May 2016,"While it looks very picturesque when the sun is setting the beach is heavily littered and, with open drains running across it and entering the ocean, the idea of swimming was unattractive"
Glick76au,"Hoppers Crossing, Australia",May 2016,Nice beach once you negotiate the right rate for a deck chair. We had a great day lounging around a nod a few dips in the surf. The hawkers were a bit annoying but you get that. 
Kaiser2290,"Bristol, UK",May 2016,"The beach is quite flat, with little character to it. It is simply filled with hundreds of sunbeds and its hard to find a spot on the beach where you wont hear blaring music! Good for thise who just want to drink in the sun, but not for those who want to relax! The current is very strong here, so if youre not a good surfer, you may find it very tough and daunting to learn here as you'll get chucked about a lot!!!"
msharma1969,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2016,We visited  other beaches like nusa dua and another private one whose name I don't remember but this one was the best of all 
Samantha K,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2016,My first time experiencing a beach with strong waves that I couldn't do anything in the sea. I don't surf so all I did was just lay by the beach and also workouts. 
jennpf,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Lovely beach. Clean sand. Quiet and peaceful. You will not be harassed to buy things or have massages etc like Kuta. It is quite calm. The water is not calm and can get rough. Be careful if you are not a strong swimmer or have small children. Some sections are patrolled by the lifeguard. 
pamelamY8048LY,"Golden Grove, Australia",May 2016,"You simply must visit the beach at sunset to watch the sun go down as you enjoy a drink on one of the many beanbags provided.  Table service , cheap drinks and a wonderful atmosphere."
MissM,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,he beach is 3 minutes walk from the villa and an early morning walk is a great way to start the  day- before the stresses of massages and swimming and reading!
Mary T,"Rockingham, Australia",May 2016,its very dirty lots of people pestering you if i had children would not let their feet touch the floor
LondonLola1,london,May 2016,"This beach could be great with a little care and attention. There are several beach bars at night where you can enjoy live music, however some of the acts compete to be heard and if sitting in one bar the sound of that bars entertainers can be drowned out by the musicians of the bar next door. Also the beach could do with a bit of a tidy up. Beds charged at 100,000 IDR for two which you can try to negotiate as it works out to be abt £8.00 and you can get a meal for two for that price."
MarkWilliams63,"Tweed Heads, Australia",May 2016,"Great Cantina just up from W resort . Cheap drinks and food . The food is also really good  . Hire a lounge for 50000 for as long as you like . The beach itself is a little dangerous so be careful . Strong currents can drag you around . A little dirty at low tide . Alot of plastic and other rubbish on the beach . Great for the Bali sunsets as well . Great fun , but be careful in the water."
elementary1969,161 contributions,May 2016,Seminyak beach is a nice Long clean beach with many restaurants and bars along the beach. You can rent out loungers and umbrellas for a modest cost for the day. The sand is a dark Colour but clean. You will find many locals selling their products along the beach ranging from coconuts to art to kites. In the evening a number of the bars and restaurants put out chairs so you can dine on the beach itself. There is quite a strong current and strong waves at parts of the beach so some care is needed and close supervision of children.
eliforyou,"Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India",May 2016,Totally loved my surfin. For beginners and intermediates this is a perfect spot to learn and improve.
roseymaher,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Surf beach. Little bit dirty. Nothing special and wasn't worth making a special trip for. If you stayed next door to the beach u might visit
MattAitchison,"Aberdeen, UK",Apr 2016,"Myself and my girlfriend were expecting a pristine white beach with a couple of cool bars, so we were slightly disappointed. More of a mediterranean style Spanish beach with sometime pretty awful live music at every bar during the night (which is played on individual stages with massive speakers so you can't really have a nice chilled conversation). Not what we expected it to be - if you want a chilled out paradise vibe, Gili Trawangan is an absolute must.  "
Paulette W,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Apr 2016,"Fruit, drinks, pedicures, manicures, hair braiding, relaxing, shopping, reading, sleeping, in the shade, in the sun.... Etc.Wonderful!"
Sinisa K,"Belgrade, Serbia",Apr 2016,"I didnt like  this beach, looks very dirty .Very bad smell.If u  want  white sands  and blue water this is not  that area!"
Sema_KM,"Istanbul, Turkey",Mar 2016,"The beach is rather clean. People come from the temple to the beach on a regular basis for the morning and the evening prayers. The sea is extremely wavy. If you want to go for a swim, be prepeared for a tiring battle. There are life guards present all the time to keep you away from the danger zones. "
MGP03,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,Visited Seminyak beach for our first day in Bali and was pleasantly surprised by the lack of hawkers and people. Water was beautifully warm with some decent waves for an old bloke. As long as you don't expect pristine white sand you should enjoy the experience!
Geehee,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Apr 2016,We enjoyed a morning walk along Seminyak Beach but I definitely wouldn't say its one of the nicer ones ive seen in the world. There were many stray dogs and the water was quite dirty. It was fine for a walk though and quite a social experience!
Mike C,8 contributions,Sep 2015,Beach was ballin. Huge beach with tons of ppl. Lounge chairs available would pay more then $15 CAD for the day. 
Beanie W,"Middlesborough, null, United Kingdom",Apr 2016,Bit smelly from the river a little further down flowing into the sea. Tourists are ruining it by littering without care and the lounge chairs are a little more expensive than Kuta beach. 
Byron E,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Not the best beaches in the world, Phuket being much much better and not like Boracay with its white sand. I would say it's an ugly beach, but clean and plenty of food along the beach. Also plenty of water activities available, but again not as good as you'd find in Phuket. I don't know why people come to Bali as its overpriced now and even beach side meals in local owned restaurants are around AUD$7-10 a meal, beer about AUD$4-5 a bottle (Phuket equivalent is less than half that). People are nice, and not annoying trying to sell u stuff but not pushy. What it lacks are beach massages like in Phuket, and definitely not as nice. See photos and you'll see what I mean. "
Jessica,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,"Ok so the beach isn't that beautiful. The sand isn't white and the water isn't turquoise like a beach you would find in Australia, however the atmosphere is relaxed, the sunsets are to die for and there are loads of restaurants, bars along the beach, many of which have live music playing and great cocktails. You don't come here for the beauty of the beach as much as you would for the atmosphere. It's lots of fun and worth a visit. "
carolbali,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2016,Plenty of bars & restaurants along the beach with great views. Popular area with learn to surf schools.Loads of beach lounges for hire. Beach itself is dark sand and locals try to remove rubbish from the area.Good place to park your bum and watch the day go by.
Jenni W,"Airlie Beach, Australia",Apr 2016,"The beach at Seminyak is a mix of fun in the water, lazing on the beach (with a cool drink), buying a bargain from the friendly sellers & experiencing the amazing Bali sunset in a comfy chair/beanbag. It's the best! Stay at Pelangi Bali & this beautiful beach is on your doorstep! I've already booked again for later this year..... can't wait! 😎🌴🏄🏻👙🏊🏼🍴👍"
Whitney H,Cronulla,Apr 2016,Gets very busy on the beach Sundays when the locals come down to play their friendly soccer matches and bring their families for a swim
StanlyNapoleon,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"a good for sunset viewing and just walk through the coastal line.So many good café, bars or just a place to relaxed and unwind yourself."
sandjasmine,"Toronto, Canada",Jan 2016,Nothing much but beautiful. There are eating places adjacent to the beach. It's quiet and has beautiful sunrise.
Jenny M,"Perth, Australia",May 2016,"Quieter, cleaner and less hawkers than Legian and Kuta beaches. Lots of little beach cafés to stop at for a Bintang or a cool drink"
Prest0n26,"Perth, Australia",May 2016, A very interesting part of Seminyak big waves with beautiful water ideal for swimming or surfing all year round
Abby L,58 contributions,May 2016,"Purposely avoided Kuta to get away from the crowd, yet not wanting to miss out on the nightlife happenings in Bali... So chose this place to stay instead. Really enjoyed the beanie bags prepared by the beach at night while listening to live bands."
59_lee,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",Oct 2015,"OK, Liked the fact, most places, that sold food drinks etc, had a decent toilet facilities....  didnt like the sun bed owners, trying ""it on""  IE charge what ever price, that suits them. Or you have to batter!!!!!!  Not for a sun lounger.."
50Debbie50,"Pretoria, South Africa",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach in front of the Alila Hotel was perfect for walking, running and even for a shallow swim. Lots of activity on  the beach near 6 o clock as people settle to watch the sunset."
dakotamorton,55 contributions,Apr 2016,"After hearing some not so pleasant things about Kuta beach, I can't say how happy we were to be close to Seminyak Beach. Very clean, and lots of little spots to chuck a towel down if you want to pay $70,000+ for beach-chairs. "
ptk_from_dy,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"Staying at Seminyak we had 3 options to get to Legian/Kuta; taxi, walk the street or my favourite - walk down and up the beach! Less crowded, cooler and way more enjoyable.  Walk up the beach to Ku De Ta or Potato Head!  And at sunset - listen to live music, sit in a bean bag and sip on some cool drinks!  Perfect way to end the day and start the evening!"
Lauren M,"Canberra, Australia",May 2016,"Went a few times to have a drink as the sun went down, was quite nice to see the sun set and listen to some live music. In terms of the actual beach it was very dirty, lots of rubbish. The surf was very choppy and shallow. Don't swim there unless you're a strong swimmer, make sure to swim between the red and yellow flags, there are lifesavers but they don't seem to pay much attention. Certainly wouldn't allow children to swim unless they were very good swimmers. If you are looking for a clean and beautiful beach this is not the place, go down to the southern beaches (around Uluwatu and nusa dewa). But mind you I am Australian so I am used to some very beautiful beaches!"
Maksym S,23 contributions,Apr 2016,What a beach! We were coming here every day for about 5 last days in a row! Beach boys are always ready to talk nad make for you some great price for the beach chair or Surf rent... And it was not so crowded as Kuta... much more less sellers of sarongs and pedicure services! Surfing was great! And absolutely amazing sunsets with nice cold beer or cocktail on the soft chair with lounge music! Loved this place! 
tazzi74,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2016,Was a nice beach to go for a swim and get a cold beer and watch the sun set but i dont rate the beaches as good as the ones we have in Australia.Local people are fantastic and always willing to help out.
flymetothemoon123,"Mumbai, India",May 2016,"Great beach especially if you're staying in Seminyak. But it's usually packed during the daytime so if you're looking for a more quiet or secluded beach, this isn't for you. Lots of small bars on the beach serving drinks and hookah. Bean bags and lounge chairs dot the beach. Nice place to spend an afternoon or early evening. "
pjhaake,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",May 2016,"Quite strong waves and good fun for a quick swim but definitely not relaxing. After hearing some negative reviews, was pleasantly surprised that the beach was clean and free of litter, but also free of jellyfish, rocks/coral, etc. that can make ocean swimming unpleasant. Really enjoyed the beach!"
Skha18,"London, UK",May 2016,"We ventured down the road to Seminyak beach today and it was lovely. We got there via Ku De Ta (you can park up on the side of the road and walk through) and there were plenty of sun loungers available to rent, people who own them were more than happy to move them into the sun for us. You do have lots of people strolling the beach to sell bits and pieces but they will leave you alone after a smile and a no thank you. Lots of surfing going on but not much swimming due to the big waves. I only went in up to my waist before the tide felt too strong and the waves were crashing around me and didn't feel comfortable going out any further. Lovely clean beach, very friendly people just a shame we couldn't go for a proper swim in the sea but there are plenty more beaches to choose from for that in Bali!"
Mitu J,"Mandsaur, India",Jan 2016,Evenings are eventful on the beach. U have live music drinks and awesome sunset view. U can stay on the beach for hours and hours. but if You are a vegetarian then food is the problem.
Isabelle M,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2016,"Sitting on the bean bag enjoying my bintang beer at night. I took a blur bird taxi from kerobokan about 2km away from my villa to the beach side, there is a minimum charges for 30000 rupiah. Enjoying the music and sea wave. "
BrigLife,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"Lots of people, i would shy from the famous beaches if possible.Also, many retailers pushing souvenir sales"
BobNthQldAustralia,Nth Qld Australia,Mar 2016,"I love the beach there were good waves and the water was warm, there was NO undertow so it was safe. The hotel, (Harris) had deck chairs and umbrellas which was good and they provided a towel."
Simon W,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"This is the second night we enjoyed a chilled out dinner on the beach, we've been heading down around 4:30-5ish, kids have time for some fun then dinner on the beach "
didot,sydney,May 2016,"We went there on Sunday afternoon and could not bear to stay longer than 5 minutes. It was hectic, loud, hot, uncomfortable and just awful. However today  (wednesday) we walked along the beach from Kuta and landed back there. It was just great to have an ice cold beer, fewer people, reclining chairs, hasty pedicure and beautiful sunset."
Vadim K,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"The beach is overall clean in April, the sea is a great fun to swim in due to the crazy waves. Unfortunately, the whole beach is flooded by local people trying to sell whatever they can sell to you..."
Jason C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"By far this is one of the good spot at Bali to hang out around the beach. However the wave could be strong some time, that's why you should put attention on how strong the current at that day..."
Keith M,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2016,This beach is over 10km long and has sunbeds and small popup bars all along the waterside - the sea and waves are fantastic [watch out for cross swells and surfers] - lots of restaurants to choose from and most have live music on the beach at night - a night to remember 
Matt W,"Hobart, Tasmania, Australia",Jul 2015,"Less in your face and not so many all night partiers.. Has all the goods: great food, shops, bars and the beach is OK with a reasonable beginners surf break.. Just watch for spontaneous rips.. Cheaper accommodation in the back blocks with easy walking to beach."
Oliver,"Wilton Manors, FL",Apr 2016,"Honestly do not even bother going there! I was appalled when I saw how nasty this beach is. I mean Bali does not have nice beaches at all unless you are a surfer but this one is one of the worst. It just looks like you are at Brighton beach , NYC. The water is black, the sand is black with litter everywhere, the lounge chairs are 100 years old and vendors haggle you for a pedicure or a sarong every 5 minute! I had to leave to go to Kuta beach which is also disgusting. Bali is definitely NOT the place to go if you want turquoise water and white sand beaches! "
Jodie C,"Bundaberg, Australia",Apr 2016,"Kuta Beach much nicer then the one at Seminyak, but much busier. Seminyak is just the beach, where as Kuta has all of the locals set up offering massages, hair braiding, hire a few chairs with some alcohol and watch the sun set.. So if you want to avoid any of that then Seminyak doesn't have any of that."
Glenn H,World,Apr 2016,"Living on the east coast of Australia, you don't get many chances to watch the sunset over the ocean, and the changing colours that it causes. It's always great to watch..."
krchung12,"Baker City, OR",Apr 2016,"Stayed 5-7 minute walk from Seminyak beach. Pop in headphones or pretend your asleep to avoid hawkers selling you stuff. Got a nice henna tattoo done there, though :)Good swimming waves and my hubby tried out surfing and had a good time-although try to shop around as my husband felt the surf instructor he had didn't give sufficient attention for the price. Don't accept a beach chair for more than 50,000 IDR for two people the whole day, so make sure to negotiate and don't be afraid to pass up a place or two, cuz most likely the first place you passed up may welcome you back at the price you initially wanted :)All around I think it's a nice beach with a nice sunset and decent vibes. P.S. Try out Sand beach bar & restaurant at night on the beach--decently priced with good live music and is one of the more attentive, service-oriented staff/waiters/waitresses than the other spots nearby. "
TravelTaoSG,Singapore,Mar 2016,"Came here twice on 2 occasion, You can find bars, restaurants near by. Suntan on the beach, learn surfing, play in the sea, take a walk. At night, usually many bars/restaurants will bring out bean bags on the beach and have live music and its a sight to hear and see.For surfing, its a very good place for beginners. Price per person for 1h lesson and 1h free surfing $100,000 - $150,000"
Claire N,"Scarborough, Australia",Apr 2016,"We still love a beer on the beach, we always sit at Aussies bar it's just fun.  We do our souvenir shopping for the kids while we have a beer, massage and buy our fruit.You have to be prepared to be swarmed by the hawkers and be able to get rid of those you don't want to buy from- my method is be really nice and have fun with them but be up front and let them know right away that you're not interested and if you tell them you are then you should buy it from them and not waste their time arguing over 50 cents.  We get the cheapest prices on the beach and the fruit is always fresh and fabulous. It's important to remember this is whats done on the beaches in Bali, you can't be rude to these guys this is just what they do.Its a fun place to meet other travelers and have a chat, share experiences and make plans.Always worth a sit down for a icey cold drink . :-)"
Travellers057,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"Joined a large number of locals, ex pats and visitors walking along the clean beach (sadly  it has to be cleaned up early morning in the morning because of the significant sea pollution)every morning, especially good at low  tide. The growth of beachside bars that offer cocktails, cold Beer (restaurant prices) and local wines inthe afternoon is a good spot to watch the sunset"
Kathryn D,Australia,Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach was nice enough. I have been to much better beaches in the past.It was clean and not to many locals trying to sell you things. There were heaps of restaurants and bars. Plenty of lounges to hire. It was a pretty calm day when we went but many people were having a go at eater sports anyway. The water is warm but not very clear. Still great to cool off, after being in the hot sun all day. "
skyline1088,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Very nice beach where you can walk all the way out when the tide is low. Good choice of restaurants along the beach front too with their own entertainment music choices. Sunset is spectacular there. Definitely worth a trip!
Pranaya,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2016,The beach is good and get populated . There are many beach side shacks there to chose from and the seating options are vibrant . Very safe 
John C,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,Nice day out on the beach. Clean with plenty of sun beds just opposite Kudeta Restaurant.Was unpatrolled at the time we went so you need to becarful not to go too far out into big surf.Good for surfing.
sandeep b,"Mumbai, Maharashtra, India",Sep 2015,"Great stay in seminayak and the beach is really beautiful. It was very close to where we stayed. Also, there are lot of clubs around where you can just sit chill and enjoy the sunset."
Jeffrey G,"Carlsbad, CA",Apr 2016,"Very nice clean beach, good waves, water looks clean.Waves can get fairly big 6' plus when we were there one of the days in April.Probably better to stay out when they get large, but otherwise a good swimming beach."
sfit4391,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"worth taking a wander down to the beach for relaxing drinks while watching the sunset,do a bit of shopping for watches,sunglasses,sarongs and jewellery as the beach vendors are around and also a few of the bars have music as well"
Lulufluff,"Bunbury, Australia",Apr 2016,"We went at night time and the beach didn't seem to have rubbish. We missed the sunset but that's okay as we enjoyed our night visit. There are restaurants that set up bean bags on the beach so it has a nice atmosphere. We were only approached once to buy things but we were polite and said no, and the man just moves on. "
sharbiiiie,45 contributions,Apr 2016,Seminyak beach seems to be a peaceful spot that you are less likely to get hassled on. It can get busy around sunset as people are out for walks on the beach and there was quite often a game of soccer
LittleLatte,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2016,"Compared to Kuta Beach which you might be strolling with huge amount of tourists, Seminyak beach is so much better and cleaner. There are restaurants along the beach. "
Alan C,"Bendigo, Australia",Apr 2016,Lots of people around but does have a very nice sunset. A lot of restaurants or party cafe by the beach so access to the beach can be not so straight forward. We happened to be having dinner at Potato Head Beach Resort.
Steve D,2 contributions,Apr 2016,This is a great beach to visit at night. The sound of the ocean creates serenity. Definitely check it out.
konrad s,"Cootamundra, Australia",Apr 2016,Somewhat dirty and constantly hassled by Hawkers.I  would have liked to have seen the  sunset but weather precluded this. I doubt you would be left alone to enjoy the experience.
mukesh_shukla_pune,Pune,Apr 2016,Nice clean beach. Not very crowded and was nice to go for the pleasant sunsets. Quite a few warnings around if you want some food or beers.  
delboy99,cornwall,Apr 2016,Seminyak Beach is a very large stretch of light brown volcanic sand .. The sea here is quite shallow so you can walk out quite far ... It does have some large waves rolling in which are ideal for surfing & body boarding .. Plenty of bars & restaurants to sit & watch the world go by ..
Crystal T,61 contributions,Apr 2016,"Loved this beach, so much to do.Endless subbed options that will bring you food and ice cold drinks, ice cream.Board hire or learn to surf.Swimming flags to keep you safe.Waves can get quite big and undertow very strong as well."
Wilson T,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"doing a bit of eating, reading and tanning then returned in the evening for a few drinks on the beach under lit up umbrellas. Not only a great place for a surf and a swim, but head down and grab a beanbag, a cocktail and watch the sunset with some great music "
Kathryn21121963,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,Get down early to enjoy a cocktail whilst watching the sunset. There are a few bars where bands play live music. Not too many hawkers either. 
Kirsten J,"Dublin, Ireland",Apr 2016,"I have been to much nicer beaches than this in Bali. It's not very clean, we didn't walk too far so it may be slightly nicer in other places - but certainly the part we were on wasn't nice at all. It's not very clean and smells like drains "
Chris D,"Bay of Plenty Region, New Zealand",Apr 2016,"any beach in the pacific is nicier  dirty and ill kept . the beach at kuta is much tidier  and  big seas, however very crowded, with lots of people trying to sell you things.  darker sandy beaches at seminak  but not that flash"
estoy,"Cagayan de Oro, Philippines",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach is a long stretch of shoreline of fine black sand. It is not crowded whether one will go there in the morning or afternoon. We went swimming in the morning & the waves is not that intense. A lot of people are jogging, walking & some are even doing yoga on the beach. In the afternoon we strolled  the beach to watch the sunset. It is so nice to see the kaleidoscope of color, the sky merging with the ocean as the shore reflects the colors of the sunset when the water rushes back to the sea...a respite from the crowd of tourists in Bali."
Nic Pat,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,"Beautiful, HOT, clean beach that stretches far in both directions. You can see the aeroplanes take off from the Airport to the left.Excellent place to relax under a beach umbrella (hired for $5). Ice cold drinks only a hand signal away. Loved it!!! "
Britneyooo,"Queensland, Australia",Jan 2016,"Dont expect nice beaches in this part of Bali. There are people pestering you. You can hire boards, and there are chairs usually to sit on (might have to pay for them). If you do want nice beaches, head to Finn's Beach Club or Uluwatu. Both are beautiful.  Finn's is much more commercialised than Uluwatu. It has a restaurant and day beds and trendy, hip music playing, a bar... and is fully set up. You have to pay to get down there (you go down on a little cart, sort of scary).  The food is expensive. Uluwatu on the other hand is for surfy people uninterested in all that stuff. To get to the beach you walk down stairs on a cliff (not scary, totally safe). There are traditional Indonesian cafes sticking out of the cliff with really yummy food and an AMAZING view. Plus, you don't have to pay to use the beach. I much prefer Uluwatu, but that's just me. "
coverallclothing,"Gisborne, Australia",Apr 2016,"What a great experience! Go for the sunset, pull up a bean bag, relax & enjoy the music! At each little place the music is great & food incredible value. It's an experience not to be missed if visiting Bali. Very casual & you're sure to find some music to suit your taste. Service great at all of them & the best place to have fun with friends. We will do this every time we go to Bali, highly recommended!"
LSJ,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Seminyak is one of the beach that you would like to visit if you prefer a quiet place to admire the waves. It has alot of restaurants along the beach with beanbags for your relaxation. Live Bands are there to provide the music with the waves. It was a good place to relax and watch the sunset. Definitely a place to visit if you seek a different feeling compared to Kuta beach.
TerjeHoegberg,"Oslo, Norway",Aug 2015,"Nice beach, less beach vendors, less surfers and less tourist than the more famous Kuta beach. Good alternative for a lazy day at beach or enjoying the sunset."
Kristine B,"Kingston, Jamaica",Apr 2016,"My friend and I wandered down to the beach after a nice salad lunch. The beach was nice but a bit disappointing, mainly because there is no accommodation made for people like us who are not staying at a waterfront hotel to relax on a lounge chair. Basically, we walked the beach and had to sit on our slippers when we wanted to rest for a bit. Still, there were no vendors harassing us on the beach, which can be a problem at beaches the world over. Also, the views were really nice. We happened to be there during low tide so we actually walked quite far out into the ocean while we were still on dry land. The surf was rough so we didn't swim but the water felt great as we stood in it up to our knees. Will I go back? No, I think I'll enjoy the pool at my hotel instead. The beach wasn't great enough to warrant another visit, especially since we're not surfers - there were a few surfers in the water but not being a surfer myself, I can't give any feedback on that aspect of things. However, I'm happy I can at least say that I checked it out."
Mikhael,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Aug 2015,"Was a good beach, didn't notice the countless of hawker selling stuff every few meters and calling you out every few second."
Bridget M,Melbourne,Mar 2016,I would probably rate this as good but TA doesn't have that rating so...it's not so bad but I'm spoilt with the white sand and clean beaches of Australia.This is a mixture of black volcanic and white sand beach so gives the impression of not being as clean as it could be but the beach is very long and very wide and friendly enough for your kids to paddle in.
Jane J,26 contributions,Apr 2016,Staying in Seminyak this trip our hotel had regular shuttles to Seminyak Square and beach. I was surprised to see that it was quite cllean there and so revisited a number of times. Sunsets were lovely. 
Tania putri,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Apr 2016,The beach is nice. Very hot. Very crowded and noisy. A lot of beach club there so we can't really walk along the beach too far.
John O,85 contributions,Apr 2016,"Good surf for body surfing, plenty of little cafes for a cheap drink or lunch (nasi goreng for $ 3.50 au!)"
melbournetraveller24,Melbourne Australia,Jan 2016,"Each morning we walked on the beach at sunrise. It was so beautiful, watching the light change as the sun rose, and we had the beach to ourselves. Glorious! Sunsets on the beach were spectacular too."
Simon H,7 contributions,Apr 2016,"Great beach day and night.  Take a walk grab a drink and chat to the locals at one of the many beach bar set ups all the way to Kuta.  The restaurants and vendors at night are awesome.  Let the kids buy a night lantern and let it go over the beach for a great memory.  Very safe and a lot of fun,"
GCampbell67,"Livingston, UK",Apr 2016,"A very very large beautiful beach, there are busier bits or quiet bits, very peaceful with big slashing waves, great if your a surfer. Water is warm, just overall beautiful."
CandN07,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"I love this long beach for morning walks and lazing at the bean bag bars  to watch the sunset- truly magical. The kids love the beach for it's nighttime entertainment- hawkers selling glow toys, art work, massages, sarongs and the beautiful coloured candle lanterns that are released after sunset.What I dislike immensely is all the rubbish both washed up and left higher on the sand.On my 1/2 hour morning walk yesterday I passed copious plastic bags, 2 used disposable nappies, 2 tubes of toothpaste, plastic water bottles etc. It is not a prisptine beach, it has  streams of foul water running into it and although they do clean the beach in the mornings it is still polluted. I don't swim there and my kids, who swallow sea water like seals, are not allowed in either- pools are a safer option."
Mohammed A,"Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2016,"Don't just miss coming to Seminyak beach , a super lovely spot, would highly recommend to spend some quality good romantic time in here if you are here as a couple!! "
Ireneren,20 contributions,Mar 2016,"We have been travelling around Bali and had our last days near this beach. It was around Nuepi, Balanese New Year. A religious time where lots of ceremonies are held at the beach. This means a lot of polution, 1000s of palm leaf plates with cigarettes, flowers ect. all over. At the same time the beach it self didnt appeal to anything else but surfing, not swimming. But the beach was nice for walking and watching sun sets."
McDeal04,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2016,Had a nice time on the beach. Especially loved how they had restaurants/bars right on the beach with lots of comfortable lounge seating. We saw on big bean bag chairs while we watched the sunset and drank beers. They also had a great live band playing on the beach. The only downfall was the beach merchants. My advice would be to not buy or talk to any of them if you don't want anything. If you buy something from one they will all flock to you. Although it was nice to get a foot rub while watching the sunset :) 
Amerikki,"Shenzhen, China",Feb 2016,"A nice beach a little removed from the more crowded ones.  Loved all of the little ""bars"" in the area.  Though you need to pay to use the beach chairs, it was a lot of fun to sit and watch the waves crash while enjoying a cold one or two."
Bev S,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,"Am I missing something here? We are staying in the middle of Seminyak so a trip to the beach was a must do. Went to the Mosaic Beach club (which is quite okay) but very disappointed in the beach and can't recognise what I saw in some of the reviews! Hot, grey, coarse sand, ungroomed beach access points, strong tides (and I can swim well) and sewage outlets so a walk along the beach is an obstacle course. I like lots of things about Bali but give me Aussie beaches anytime, rather than Seminyak, although I will go back to enjoy the Sunset!"
Kalsum27,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,"my husband and I are choose to stay at Seminyak for our honeymoon in Bali. What can I say is, Seminyak is a perfect location for those who want to stay at moderate area. Easy to find a Halal food for the muslim but if you can't find the Halal restaurant, just asked the local people because most of the Bali's local people are friendly and helpful."
698DHRUBA007,"Pune, India",Apr 2016,Beautiful. Clear water. Clean sea beach.Carry a good camera. Carry water bottle.Nice for water sports.Do use Sun screen lotion.
梨絵 中,22 contributions,Apr 2016,I have been to beach on sunset was so beautiful! had a seat and drinking beer!とても綺麗なサンセットを見ながらビール飲んだり気持ちいいー！周りにはリゾートのバーなどもあるから、ご飯食べながらとかでもいい感じ！
Rainindancers,214 contributions,Apr 2016,This area of Bali is nice although there are a lot of sewerage ports which enter the ocean via the middle of the beach. You walk the beach and you have to jump over the sewerage running into the water
aprilnyeo,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2016,It is less crowded and much cleaner than in Kuta.  Not many touting and it feels safer with securities in every single hotel along the beach.
Hungaryforlife,"Paris, France",Apr 2016,"Happy , smiling people , sellers dont hassle you too much . Enjoyed the loungers for The Courtyard Marriot hotel , in perfect position to watch hubby surfing . Beach and laneway behind clean and great little cafes .A real buzzy area late in the afternoon with music , live and dj and cold Bintang !"
tmbobSlough,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,Good beach and being in this area is quieter than Kuta beach. Was clean and good swimming. Lots of places along the beach front from upmarket restaurants and cheaper places and bars to eat and drink. Sunset here is popular with bars cafes putting out tables and chairs on the beach for the sundowner drinks session. 
Jacob15,"Wellington, New Zealand",May 2015,"Not quite as nice a section of the entire beach, as the Kuta section. There were quite a few rivers that water poured down at different times, seeming to bring pollution with them, from the streets above. Lot of kids were playing in those sections of flowing water. "
paula2427,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,"This beach is full of restaurants and beach clubs, really convenient for friends and young families. Clean and warm water."
sarahkennedy57,"Wollongong, Australia",Apr 2016,"It was my first time visiting this beach. After only visiting Kuta beach, Seminyak beach is just amazing!!!!! We arrived at 11am and it was so quiet. No where as busy as Kuta Beach. My daughter even got her hair done and nails painted. I found we weren't hassled as much as we have been at Kuta beach, The beach was very clean and pretty. We will definitely be back to Seminyak"
Jennie M,"Glasgow, UK",Apr 2016,"Beach is ok, however the breaks are so big you can't really go for a relaxing swim. Water Is quite shallow. Prepare for people trying to sell you things "
LMCNX,"Phoenix, AZ",Apr 2016,"Once that we got far enough away from the stream the beach itself was okay.  Did not like the vendors that overcharge for everything.  It took some time to figure out what you should pay to rent a beach chair, etc.  We enjoyed the beaches on the east coast more than the crowds at Seminyak."
Sanna S,"Tallinn, Estonia",Apr 2016,"Super places on the beach, to party, to enjoy, to eat or drink. Super big waves, nice to watch and walk."
seantzw,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,We went for a stroll along seminyak beach and it was fantastic. The sand was top notch and the views were spectacular. Well worth a visit! 
Alisa W,16 contributions,Apr 2016,The beach is dirty and cant believe  people would swim here. There is rubbish  everwhere and the sand is like dirt   
taylormcland,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"This the best beach i have seen, this beach very good to see the sunset and on the day time also nice to get sun."
Tim P,13 contributions,Apr 2016,"As Aussies we are spoilt with some of the best beaches in the world. Seminyak beach is nothing special, surf-able waves, but still just ok. I wouldn't return. It is similar to Kuta Beach, but without the great food and stalls. "
EatFunLove,Taiwan,Jun 2015,"If you can't swim, be stay somewhere close to where people do sunbathing. The sometimes waves can go very long distance within few second. Extra careful if you are with camera and phone."
Mai,9 contributions,May 2015,"When we went, it was from afternoon to night and saw the beautiful sunset.Not too crowded and definitely a must."
sandy75014,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2016,"I stayed in Seminyak at Dash Hotel and had a wonderful stay there. Seminyak is perfect if you want to party but the beach is not the best one of Bali if you are a swimmer. Besides, Seminyak as the vibe of little town on the beach like Dauville or St Tropez. This is very pleasant to stroll in small streets for shopping...very nice boutiques and good restaurant & coffee shop. The location is perfect if you are trendy, like party and can drive a motorbike to explore Bali"
AmbLee,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2016,"My friend was so excited to show me this beach, as he said it was so beautiful. As I arrived I was quite surprised as to how average this beach was. There was a large stretch of sand, some of which was black and there was quite a bit of litter flowing in the streams to and from the ocean. Anyone who doesn't notice the pollution at this beach needs to get their eyes checked and reconsider what a good beach looks like. The hawkers also made it somewhat unpleasant, and the entrance/exit is quite tricky to find if you're a first timer. We weren't allowed to walk through any hotels to the main road, so we left with blistered feet from the hot sand trying to find our way out. I would not visit this beach again in a rush. I've seen much better beaches in Bali."
dundeetours,"Hobart, Australia",Apr 2016,Such a great experience Can't be faulted even the vendors were nice when we said no thank youPs trip advisor we don't appreciate having to write 100 words or more just to submit & be helpful 
Sal E.M A,26 contributions,Apr 2016,"The first day we arrived to Bali our Friend took us to Seminyak beach, the lights and the atmospher were denomination of beauty, music was popping at each corner and it was a nice evening chill area. The next morning we went to Surf as well, and since they we go surfing there Everyday especially since the waves are crashing us 🏊🏼🏊🏼🏄🏽👌🏻"
Moha29,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",May 2015,"Seminyak Beach is quieter than Kuta beach. you can swim , chill and relax. and dont forget to see the beautiful view of the sunset"
BJAM1702,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2016,"Not only a great place for a surf and a swim, but head down and grab a beanbag, a cocktail and watch the sunset with some great music"
JamieIrwin,"Gardenvale, Ballymoney",Apr 2016,"We had a lazy day early on Seminyak beach, doing a bit of eating, reading and tanning then returned in the evening for a few drinks on the beach under lit up umbrellas. This is what I pictured Bali being like. Absolute bliss.The pictures will illustrate better than my words ever could."
Sulacool,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"quite beach than kuta beach, good for relaxing and swimming, enjoying sunset with afternoon drink, good time in afternoon and got fantastic moments with couple, friends or family."
Nicoman,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"The water is warm, the waves are perfect for bogie boarding, the sand is black and it is never crowded. The sunsets are spectacular."
Almyhappy,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,Nice stretch of beach with black sand.. Bring a long a matt or beach towel if you do not want to pay for the beach chair.
AnnieA86,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Apr 2016,"We really like Seminyak Beach. Saw that many persons has written in their reviews that beach is poorly cleaned, but we did not experience that at all. Very clean beach and many nice pool/drink bars along the beach as well. "
sbg62015,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Regulars to the seminyak area - we stayed at the Oberoi for our Wedding anniversary. Beach is great by bali standards - as always watch out for dogs and their outputs. Surfed 9 days in a row - gold.
Campsi1030,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2016,"We have been staying in Jimbarran but have visited Seminyak and Kuta. We have decided that if we return we would stay in Seminyak. Jimbarran is a little quiet and away from things and Kuta is, well, Kuta. Seminyak is the in between option. Good beach with more sand, large number of restaurants and less hawkers than Kuta while a bit more lively than Jimbarran."
Brendan T,292 contributions,Apr 2016,Not a really special beach. Its clean and has alot of beach bars. Not As much vendors As on kuta beach. But still there are Some.Beach beds cost around 100.000 if you dont bargain. You should at least Get them under 50.000 for a day. Good luck. 
Katie O,"Townsville, Australia",Mar 2016,"Lots of choice on the beach for live music dinner and drinks. Great value for money.Every evening whilst there we would wonder down for the beautiful sunset to top off our busy days. Lots of choice for meals . Italian, asian and western cuisine.  "
ActionAl,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2016,"Seminyak has got to be the busiest and most exciting beach resort destination in Asia! Although no longer a quiet little fishing village (which I expect some people lament) it now has something for everyone, all ages, and surprises everywhere to keep you entertained and on your toes!Highly recommend grabbing a bean bag on the beach at dusk and trying some of the local cocktails ;) Selfie stick not necessary!"
Anthony S,14 contributions,Apr 2016,"If you  are  in the area, watching the sunset at a good bar or restaurant is a must. Breath taking beauty. Beach is fairly clean and safe to swim at.  Some places about to hire surf and body boards. "
Dazhetho,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2016,"No shade, only drawback, unless you hire beach lounge and umbrella, beach hawkers weren't as frequent"
H2Odreamer,Australind- WA,Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach was OK fairly clean and not as crowded as Kuta, unfortunately  we found the hawkers on the whole to be pushy and quite rude on the day we visited which is always a disappointment in a destination known for its friendly and happy people, in fairness it is hard to make a positive comment on Balinese beaches in comparison to our beaches at home but overall was not blown away but at the same time not sorry we took the time to have a look."
Federico Q,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"The beach itself is really poor, sometimes quite dirty and smelly but there are lots of bars crating a nice atmosphere. The only problem is that bars are really close to each other and if sitting outside you can ear loud music from different bars "
Felix L,"Berlin, Germany",Mar 2016,"We went down there on our first night on Bali. The beach itself is fairly clean, considering the amount of people there. It's a nice beach, even with a decent surf break and if you like it a bit more busy with entertainment (bars, etc.) around you definitely a cool beach. Way too busy and loud for us though, so only 3 stars."
Piotr N,4 contributions,Mar 2016,"The place was covered with rubbish. Enough said i think. So much for a romantic walk if you are tripping over empty bottles. OK it must be the tourists, but it's up to the authorities to tidy up. There are a lot of bars along, nothing special. If you sit on the beach prepare to be nagged every 2min by somebody selling selfie sticks or some dubious paintings. Did not meet the expectation one bit."
sebastio Achmad,242 contributions,Apr 2016,Very nice place to hang out. You can see the sunset here. Around you can find many cafe and good restaurants. So many activities doing by tourists here. 
Ferida H,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2016,"We stayed at Pondok Sara Villas only a 5 minute walk to the beach.The sunsets were fabulous,.All the restaurants had there own bands and bean bags to relax by the beach.. Also only about a 10 minute drive to Kuta. There were lots of small and large eateries, Also if you like corn on the cob they barbeque it on the beach. Really nice and fresh. Would definitely go there again."
Preston S,"Whistler, Canada",Apr 2016,Beautiful sandy beach. Constantly changing surf. Roaring all day. Red flags are posted when the riptide is too dangerous to swim. Surfers were rocking the waves. Constant barrage of hawkers. 
178kris,"Noosa, Australia",Apr 2016,"Seminyak beach is agreat place to chill out watch the sunset have a massage ,meet the locals and enjoy the beach."
AkhilBiju,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2016,Not as crowded as some other beaches. Very picturesque and calm.we experienced a gorgeous sunset there.
Vithia P,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",May 2015,Clean and beautiful beach. Lesser people compared to Kuta beach. There are few motorized activities along the beach.
Bri B,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2016,We sat and relaxed at Opy's Beach Bar and were waited on hand and foot. Wel also dined at one of the beach restaurants and the views are just amazing. 
George K,"Athens, Greece",Mar 2016,A nice beach with even better restaurants and bars. Best time to visit is around sunset so you can enjoy a swim and a drink and relaxation time at one of the beach bars. Fine music everywhere
Sharkdive1,"Zurich, Switzerland",Mar 2016,"Overall very nice. There are not too many sunbeds in general, so be aware of this. Best is you use a Beach Club (but also there, be aware that you need to be early to get a sunbed)"
kmartyn2016,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"This beach can be a little busy, its not like our beaches in aussie, the sand is black as it is volcanic, overall the beach is good, the sunsets are amazing, great for a day relaxing on the sun lounges and watching the sunsets."
Brendan,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2016,Went once did not go back again just dirty and off putting disappointing there was nothing happening down there would not go back
Ben G,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Not really ideal for a swim etc as it seems like there is a lot of rubbish on this side of the island.
melbentley1981,"Ipswich, Australia",Mar 2016,"Beautiful sunsets, great restaurants and entertainment on the beach. A little dirty but it's ok to spend the day relaxing on one of the beach chairs. "
Scott M,"Beaumaris, Australia",Mar 2016,"This only our 3rd visit to Bali but after trying a few different spots along the stretch of beach from Ku de Ta in Seminyak to Marriot at Legian in our view the beach directly in front of Chez Gado Gado is our favorite. Water is clear, surf is good for beginners to intermediate, lounge chair hire for a pair is usually $50k per hour and surfboard hire the same.The old guy selling Bintang, water and soft drinks will run a tab, the ice cream vendor calls past regularly and if you need cheap eats you have a good selection on the beach nearby or alternatively can go more upmarket with Gado Gado.Contrastingly the Seminyak end near Ku de Ta has poor surf, the water is murky and contains quite a bit of rubbish and the beach vendors charge more saying... 'it is Seminyak'. If you enjoy the beach and swimming/surfing and have teenagers the Gado Gado area is the spot for you."
andrewwACID2000,14 contributions,Feb 2016,Restaurants are world class around Seminyak .. Walking is a little difficult as is always in Indonesia on the streets.. The Beach is like most beautiful beaches especially at sunset...  
Riona A,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2015,This beach is stunning. Soft sea sand..beautiful sunsets..and warm water. I enjoyed the afternoon here
Sam,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,"The beach was very clean ocean beautiful, nice sun loungers and a stroll over to Ku Du Ta for a great lunch and glass of wine"
Rosa S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"It is one of very busy beach in Bali with lots of pedlars and surfers. Lots of places to eat and drink and play or just for watching the sunset. There are sun loungers to hire with big umbrellas. For sure, much more relaxing, peaceful and cleaner compare to Kuta beach."
FHTworldwide,"Dubái, Emiratos Árabes Unidos",Apr 2016,"Between the most popular beaches in Bali, this one is the best one, not so smelly and crowded like kuta and nice for walking during sunset. "
Shirley Wu,"Shanghai, China",Mar 2016,We went there in one morning and it was quite. not too many people but some were jsut enjoying the sunshine. the beach itself is more clean then i expected. also you can see some rocks around the sea. we had walks on the beach and we also saw a local man was fishing. ans some were surfing. so i liked this quite morning at Seminyak beach. much better thatn Double six beach at my point of view.
Kerrymaid_Orlaith,Kerry,Mar 2016,Gorgeous sunset on bean bags at beach bars. .. lovely lighting and chilled music. Worth a trip down in the evening for nice pics. Family friendly also with vendors selling nick nacs.
daphne928,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"Love going to seminyak beach to watch the sunset and have a few drinks listening to chill out music. After 4 in the afternoon all the beach bars have set up their bean bags and fairy lights, turned up their music and local and tourists wander down and chill out."
Rebecca_andAmir,"London, UK",Feb 2016,A beautiful beach with the best view of the Balinese sunset.  Enjoy a cocktail as you watch the sun go down.
Indra P,Jakarta,Mar 2016,"Seminyak, like its brother Kuta, allowed us to see the beautiful sunset, laid back cafes, flying kites, and (not fully) good music. I recommend La Plancha as your best place to enjoy Seminyak. As i didn't prefer too dynamic clubs such as Double Six and Cocoon."
TIersHasie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Cleaner than Kuta beach and less touts around the place.Heaps of waterfront restaurant and bars with live music and tables, bean bags, shade options on the beach to see the beautiful Seminyak sunset.Good nightlife in a more upmarket environment compared to the beaches of Legian and Kuta."
Venki S,Singapore,Mar 2016,We had a great sunset view from Seminyak Beach during our visit in March 2016. Beach was clean and pleasant
Batyah_12,"Stellenbosch, South Africa",Mar 2016,The atmosphere on this outstretched beach is magical! You can have a different sunset painting on the same canvass every night. The restaurants mostly have live bands & specials on cocktails every night. During the day daybeds are available at a nominal (always negotiated!) rate
Mr. Jazz,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Mar 2016,this spot is nice & clean. also it is public and there are many activities in this spot. also the waves are not that much strong.
Timlanzon,Perth,Mar 2016,"Seminyak beach, although completely hounded by people trying to sell you items is a great place to watch the sunset. Pick any one of the amazing beach restaurants to sit it, get a beer and watch the sun go down"
Aussiejack1,"Vancouver, Canada",Mar 2016,"The beach at Seminyak has changed a lot over the last 15 years, as expected. What I did not expect this time around was the huge increase in the volume of garbage on the beach. It was very dissapointing to see so much garbage washing up on the shoreline. It was hard to enjoy a stroll along the beach while dodgeing so much garbage. So sad to see and nobody really seems to care."
Docjari18,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2016,Step out from the Oberoi Bali property and you are onto Seminyak Beach as it is kissing with the it.Beautiful beach with crystal clear water.Swim in your own privacy as not crowded..
woojin2016,"Beverly Hills, CA",Aug 2015,The most smoothest beach sand in Bali. And their sand is dark so that it reflects all light when sun goes down. Must go place!!
linlin668,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,Stayed at FuramaXclusive Ocean Beach hotel. Seminyak Beach just a few footsteps away from the hotel. Beautiful and relaxing beach. Preferred Seminyak to Kuta Beach.
PKKC,"London, UK",Mar 2016,Nice sandy beach with lounges and umbrellas for hire.  A number of beach clubs with restaurants and bars to watch the sunset.  Not sure about the drains flowing down the beach to the ocean through!!
Ian M,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2016,"The beach is a short walk from Seminkak Square and shopping district. There are umbrellas and lounges to hire and a number of hawkers coming around offering their wares for sale. There are a restaurants and coffee shops near by and a wash down arear to wash of the sand, quite beach good for the little ones.  "
philandcathy,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2016,Because it is actually the ocean the rips are strong and the waves are fearsome. I took my little boy in and left shortly after getting smashed a couple of times.  Nice to look at but be aware.
G-HARP-CRAWLEY,Crawley,Mar 2016,"Seminyak Beach is OUTSTANDING...!! Lots of great beach bars to watch the sunset, a number of them even have live music. An ideal place to relax and watch the sun go down. During the day, you can surf and swim - Just one tip - The sand gets REALLY hot... Make sure you take some flip flops..!! (Thongs for your Aussies out there!). We walked down the beach from Seminyak - Legian - Kuta (About a 35 minute walk). It is in fact the same coast line, but called different resorts. The beach seems to get more dirty as you go along. (More rubbish in the sea and on the sand)."
alvie_ch,127 contributions,Jan 2016,"Another nice beach in Bali. Not as crowd as Kuta, yet not quiet as Petitenget. I prefer this place than Kuta since it offers something ""different"". Enjoy morning or night falls here and feel the atmosphere."
Henri C,"Los Angeles, CA",Mar 2016,"From morning till sunset and beyond, there is always something going on! Great private beach clubs, or just with a towel and sunscreen, there is no bad way to go!"
Debra1967,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"We spent approx 4 hours on deck chairs under an umbrella and for first hour we had every beach seller approach us trying to sell sunglasses, handbags, jewellry, viagra, valium and offers to give massages, manicures hair braided you want something I am sure they had it or could get it for you, after they finished with us and noticed another new face trying to sit and enjoy a day at the beach we had a nice cold drink brought to us by owners of the beach bar and sat back and enjoyed the sights it was wonderful, a great way to spend a few hours,  oh and it only cost $5.00 aust dollars to sit on their chairs!!"
Tanya M,"Barcelona, Spain",Mar 2016,"This stretch of beach could be beautiful but it's not. I went back today when it was just off high tide to see if it was any better than when we were there at low tide. But no luck, it is still dirty and polluted. What a shame. The sand when wet resembles mud and sticks like paste to everything (not like most sand, which sticks but will brush off). I know the locals have to make a living but there are so many people trying to sell you things, which is fine when walking through but I imagine it could get a little annoying if you decided to sit in the beach.I saw and heard many people complaining of skin rashes and sores after the beach and swimming in the ocean.Hopefully Bali can get a plan together to reduce the water and beach pollution and increase recycling or people will stop coming and that would be a real shame. It is a beautiful long stretch of beach which needs to be cleaned up."
TheLaskers,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,Seminyak Beach is nice and clean great cabanas you must pay nice place to relax with a book .Its close to walk to if you staying in Seminyak or a quick taxi ride not expensive plenty of hotels on waters edge to have something to drink or eat.
Renee C,11 contributions,Mar 2016,"Lovely beach to visit, great sunsets. Love the bands and bean bags. Excellent service at Capil Beach Bar"
cynsync21,12 contributions,Mar 2016,"Not to far away from bustling Kuta, Seminyak is a perfect place to escape from noises. There are a lot of pretty small shops along the streets, polite people, and the weather is not as hot as Kuta. The beach is cleaner compared to Kuta Beach, strong winds and soft sands. There are a lot of stray dogs running around (loving it!). Sunset view is amazing. Very peaceful and calming, at night a lot of bars and live music around.Many eateries but a bit hard to find Indonesian restaurants here."
Paramasasti,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"If you park at pura near kayu aya, you'll find the beach next to you. Its an easy beach with not to strong wave. Very bright and no shade. You can swim or just lay on the beach waiting for sunkissed skin"
iannankervis,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Even though we went around 9pm the atmosphere was great with music and service. We would definitely come back and spend much more time having a look around.
mankur,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2016,"Been to beaches all over Bali, but this had some amazing waves to surf, and a lot of good energy on this beach"
Travelwithme,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"Its less crowded here and the beach is beautiful. Lots of small and large eateries, including spanish tapas and drinks.Make sure you bring lots of water, hat and lotion."
SJW2,"London, UK",Mar 2016,"This is not a tropical white sands beach and its where tourists and locals go to see the sunset, which were amazing! Very big and very busy "
graemephillips2016,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"My wife and I really enjoy Seminyak Beach. We surf using surfboards, body boards, the property of The Legian Bali Hotel where we stay, and plain surfing and swimming.  When the tide goes out the beach is fantastic for long walks on firmer sand. The ladies who sell beads and sarongs to keep their families housed and fed are all pleasant and beautifully mannered. Kikki, Rosy and Sally also provide massages on the beach, manicures, pedicures to a high standard which we take advantage of to add to the attraction of the beach. They treat us so well we return to the magnificent  The Legian Hotel Bali as often as we can. The really good fun is once every stay I get into a bartering discussion buying goods from them. At the conclusion I pay the agreed price and give them back the goods and tell them to sell them to someone else. Their well being is much more important to my wife and I than the goods or the money. They are lovely ladies in happy marriages with a strong sense of family. They add value to the beach in the area that is accessed by the public whether they are visiting the beach or staying at a hotel along the beach. I never cease to be amazed at how these ladies and their children speak perfect English and are so inquisitive about our 5 children, their spouses and our 13 grandchildren. It all adds to the beach that is regularly cleaned and well policed. We will return soon."
Harrisp6,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,The beach is wide and reasonably clean the sunsets are fantastic. You can walk several kms to centro shops or just wander but do it early before too hot..
RimaDuffy,"Yorkshire, UK",Jan 2016,"not that clean but not bad also, sunset here looks really great. everybody can come to this place..."
kpBunbury,"Bunbury, Australia",Mar 2016,This is a lovely beach with plenty of access to eateries and local bars. When we were here yesterday there was some excellent surf breaks. Lower key than Kuta but still approaching a highly commercial area. 
S M L S,111 contributions,Mar 2016,"This beach could be really beautiful and fine to sunbathing at. But it is quite dirty, both from people on the beach who do not have the sense to collect their rubbish and use the bins and from garbage washed up on the beach. Dogs are running around. But there are also many hotels with nice restaurants who are located at the beach. Wonderful view out towards the Indian Ocean."
adelahm2677,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,Beautiful place and was there to see the sunset. It was beautiful! Beach was quite empty which is good :)
ToniaH3,147 contributions,Mar 2016,"Nice for relaxing ,is better to get a spot near restaurant as you can then order and stay on beach.. Beach is very clean.🌴"
Tatiana1704,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"nice beach, lots of people and dogs walking. part of the beach had rubbish littered along it which was a shame. the water was very warm."
Marshalltfinch,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,"Just like most beaches on the western side of Bali, you can find a nice spot and a drink to watch the sunset. Worth heading down and chatting to the local guys down there. "
UliA3,"Beijing, China",Sep 2015,Loved the sunset overlooking the waters with a drink from one of the beach bars. Worth seeing for sure!
Jennifer T,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Feb 2016,"Very, very disappointing.  Did not dare go into the water because of visible pollution everywhere.  I even saw dead fishing floating about.  The sand is a very dirty colour and  hard to get off to clean your feet."
Tiago De Matos P,"Lisbon, Portugal",Mar 2016,The seminyak beach is long and you have good areas and bad areas. If you go from Kudeta (bar) to the left you can find the better part of the beach clean and you can rent shadow and Sun lounger very cheap .. If you go the opposite way you will find many dirty spots. 
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Mar 2016,"Whether you're looking for water sports, to read a book, go for a swim or walk, Seminyak beach is the place to be.Lovely white beach stretching on for miles with a warm blue sea to cool off in. Loads of places rent sun beds with parasols cheaply and the edge is lined with many good bars and restaurants.You do get approached quite a lot by the beach sellers but they are friendly and only trying to earn a living.A great place to spend long, sunny and relaxing days."
Tallulah T,45 contributions,Mar 2016,"Beautiful sunsets at this beach, as most are in Bali. Relaxed vibe and you don't get hassled constantly by sellers. Enjoy a Bintang on the sun bed and go for a dip."
Suzie O,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2016,Seminyak has become the upmarket area of Bali ... The beach is lovely and the sunsets are amazing. Take a stroll and stop at The W for a couple of drinks and a swim in the pool.
Ladyintheusa,"Javea, Spain",Feb 2016,Most of the hotels here back onto the beach but from what we saw no one used the beach. There are alleyways onto the beach from the main routes from the town. The town is very busy with dozens of scooters which go down to the beach. 
domjoha,"Stuttgart, Germany",Mar 2016,"Really nice clean beach which is good to start surfing. It is very touristic there, with lots of bars and little surfershops to get a surfboard or surf lesson at the beach. We got two sun lounger for 150 a day. A surfboard is around 50 per hour."
Tam13,"Mount Gambier, Australia",Mar 2016,"The water is warm, the sunset beautiful / the sand covered in rubbish. Don't let your kids go barefoot, I stood on a chicken bone and cut my foot.Otherwise nice. "
Work4Good,"Whangarei, New Zealand",Feb 2016,A quiet morning walk followed by a quick surf. What a delightful experience on his very clean beach where vendors are respectful of tourists
Ianvt2013,"Edgemead, South Africa",Feb 2016,"Seminyak Beach is a must when in Bali. This beach must be unique, because in the afternoon it transforms into a beanbag beach. Yes, all the restaurant/bars on Seminyak Beach put out beanbags and tables facing the sunset. They also have local bands performing until the sun has set. Don't miss this spectacular sight!"
Emily-Paige,"Sun Peaks, Canada",Mar 2016,Great beach! Not super busy but yet it is still one of the lovely beaches here in Bali! Every time I have been to Bali I have stayed in Seminyak!
Magnusigbg,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Mar 2016,"Went down to the beach late afternoon, not much people there then, only a few surfers. I don't surf, but probably great waves. They seemed to enjoy. Walked along the beach and just having a great time. Real beautiful view over the open sea. Great place to just walk around or surf or just sun bath. Suits every one. "
ellirainbow,"Willaston, Australia",Mar 2016,Be sure to head to one of the beach bars Pull up a beanbag have a Bintang and watch the sunset After sunset feel the ambience and romance of the gorgeous hues of lanterns that adorn the properties Truly beautiful experience 
Jeannie B,"McCrae, Victoria, Australia",Feb 2016,Unfortunately alot of rubbish gets washed up with the tide. Its a constant battle for the ladies collecting the flotsam.  You can get a good cheap massage however!
Urvi G,"Panvel, India",May 2015,The beach is just amazing. The blue water and orange skies can be watched during evening just sitting back alone. The water is clear and the beach too is very clean. Its a happening beach but u can still enjoy peace here. 
Nieadelia,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"Yes nice beach, clean not garbage everywhere, easy to chill. Love to see sunset here and the wave cool, you can play either."
sarah_ndc,Singapore,Mar 2016,Seminyak beach is great to just take an evening walk to enjoy the sunset and then check out the bars and restaurants that line the coast.
Askthegoodman,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"I first went to Seminyak Beach last year when my wife and I attended a wedding. I could only shoot from the hotel grounds because of lack of time. This time I did some internet research to find out more about this beach, which is just slightly north of Legian and Kuta. I discovered beautiful shots of people having a grand time under giant umbrellas while lying down on giant beanbags. I was determined to shoot the sunset there. As I was staying at The Magani Hotel in Legian and was carrying a heavy camera bag, I took a taxi to Seminyak Beach. The driver dropped me off near Double 6 Seminyak Hotel. From there I just walked to the beach. Instead of writing about what I saw, just take a look at some of the images I shot. You'd wish you were there."
coolchiki,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"I think this beach ia better than kuta beach (if you are staying near the city). You can rent chairs for IDR30k-IDR50k. But you cannot have a relaxing sunbath because there are alot of people offering stuff to you. Manicure, pedicure, tattoo, etc. "
Loveatfoodsight,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2016,This beach is beautiful with a no of restaurants and beach side bars. You can rent your loungers for a pretty cheap price and enjoy the waves and the breeze. This beach is excellent for surfers but not that great for swimming bcoz of the strong currents. Perfect place to enjoy the sunset as well.
Daniel T,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,"Great place for a Bali sunset. There are some nice places for that along the stretch, but best spot is around the Italian restaurant la luciolla."
Ming Yu,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2016,Soft find sandy beach with great view of sunset.   Soccer and surfing players paradise. U can have some drinks and finger food at e seaside bars sitting in bean bags.
Bj L,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,The beach has pay for chairs and its a long beach and there are no waves here. Its an ok beach but I've seen many better in Australia and other places.
Diviva,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"Compared to Kuta Beach, Seminyak Beach is alot more tranquil and peaceful. Less crowded and certainly lesser touts. The beach here is perfect to watch sunset on a clear day"
ElleCaseyauthor,"Sommieres, France",Mar 2016,"Husband and I took a stroll on this beach today. The water was warm enough to be considered bath water. The waves were incredible. If I were surfer I would have been stoked, dude. Totally stoked. We also stopped off at Ku De Ta for a slushy (we both got watermelon, but I had to add simple syrup to mine because it was toooo sour). We watched two senior citizens battle the current, only up to their knees in the water. I seriously feared for their lives as I watched them almost get sucked out with the current. I'm pretty sure this isn't a place for swimming on account of those currents and those monster waves, but it sure is pretty. Worth a walk. The only downside is the depressing garbage that washes up with the waves ... plastic bags, bottles, yogurt cups (I had no idea so many peopled liked yogurt), and weird things I couldn't identify. I feel sorry for the fish around Bali."
Raelene B,"Maroochydore, Australia",Mar 2016,"Seminyak beach it's self is pretty average. We had just stayed at Sanur and Nusa Dua which has white sand beaches and clear blue water, we expected the same of Seminyak. This was absolutely not the case. The beach is littered with rubbish, has run off from the drains which makes the area around the outlets brown and brings in even more rubbish and the sand is black, not white!The only positives I can conclude are that the sunsets are amazing from Seminyak Beach and there are many hotels which offer day bed hire, but these are very expensive for Bali. The cheapest we found was IDR 500,000 per day bed (which you can use for food and drink) which can fit 4 people comfortably however others had 6ppl at the Potato Beach Club up to IDR 1,000,000 per person at the gorgeous W Retreat."
Jitske J,"Groningen, The Netherlands",Mar 2016,Beautiful beach. I didn't try swimming but I ran next to the beach it was great for doing that. You also have beautiful sunsets from here and in the evening the place gets bubbly and alive. Also many restaurants at the beach.
Ganesh P,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Mar 2016,Overall good beach..  have plenty of sitouts nearby..  Surfing boards were available for surfers..  beach is clean and people found relaxing and chilling out..
Meryl G,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,After spending some time walking along the beach during the day we returned to a restaurant for a casual dinner - sitting on bean bags - with great entertainment
Febryan I,14 contributions,Jan 2016,"Cool place to swim, to learn how to surf, or just spending your day looking at the waves. Not dirty also. I enjoyed the time when i was here"
jillsydneyaustralia,"Woolwich, Australia",Mar 2016,"Seminyak beach is really just ok, the hawkers will inundate you, I bought something just to stop them hounding me, but even more came to me after that! It's not always that clean."
romelg33,"Beirut, Lebanon",Feb 2016,if you want to spend some extra time out of your hotel in Seminyak then you can reach this beach easily either by a hotel shuttle or through a taxi that wont cost you much. along the beach there are many cafes and bars to chill in or you can just relax on the warm sand. if you have more time and want to see better beaches I suggest you see the Padang Padang Beach as well.
Rowstr,100 contributions,Apr 2015,"If I have to give some very useful advice, skip Seminyak beach and go straight to Legian or Kuta beach (10 minutes’ walk). It basically looks the same, only difference is that the rental beds, drinks, food etc are half the price there. We found Legian beach best, since it was not crowded but also affordable."
Neelesh84,"Noida, India",Dec 2015,"Very Nice beach, you will see huge waves during high tide time and can take a dip in it too.. No Shacks or locker facility nearby so need to take care of your stuffs - though its pretty safe. Must visit for Surfers !!!"
Outgirl2,29 contributions,Mar 2016,"What more can you say, it's hot sandy and wet. Watch out for peddlers.....drive you nuts!! Constantly offering you knock of gear.  Apparently you can get fined for buying from them but I've not seen it happen "
A_Cats_World,"Lugano, Switzerland",Mar 2016,"Average beach , beautifully warm water and fun waves (be careful strong current) We paid 100K for 2 long chairs (50K each) for the full daymany restaurants and places to have a drink aroundnot very clean unfortunately Be aware that the long chairs need to be removed at 6PM when the restaurants open so deal your price accordingly ."
kmcconnell,Scot near London,Aug 2015,"This is a very busy beach with lots of pedlars and surfers, this is definitely a young persons place. Lots of places to eat and drink and play."
Felisma C,37 contributions,Feb 2016,The beach is average. Not too bad and yet not too beautiful. Just ok. Normal. But the wave is good for surfing. 
AprilApril,Gloucestershire,Mar 2016,"Watch out for the flagged area , as swimming there is too dangerous. The waves are big and great for surfing."
Dale W,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",Mar 2016,"As an avid health nut I jogged down to Seminyak beach at day-break. The beach was alive with people raking and collecting what looked to be an insurmountable amount of plastic articles.Apparently when the rains set-in, debris flows from neighbouring Java which adds to the problems Bali faces. I couldn't find a rubbish bin anywhere, except 150 meters away near a hotel opening... Obviously this is part of their problem."
rachaelh256,New Zealand,Jun 2015,Great beach with white sand. There are sun loungers to hire with big umbrellas. There are hawkers trying to sell you things but they go on their way once you indicate you are not interested. 
Maria N,"Cape Town, South Africa",Dec 2015,"Nice beach. Great for families, lots of activities, restaurants, hotels close by. Great to watch the sunset"
SgSling,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,"Seminyak is a lovely beach, especially for watching the sunset with a few cocktails (at Kudeta).You can also surf or swim. The beach itself is not one of the most beautiful beaches as the sand is quite dark."
Ed New,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2015,"One of the coziest beach experience i have ever had. everything was just perfect.There are a lot of options available with bean bag type couches you can just chill on.Beer and food are nicely priced and you can just enjoy all that with the view of the sunset plus with live music playing in the background (they accept requests), you can even sing along with the band if you wanted to.Just say no to the vendors and they won't bother you anymore."
Sherbird,66 contributions,Mar 2016,"Much more relaxing,peaceful and cleaner compare to Kuta beach, also recommend Legian beach. La plancha beach bar and restaurant is the place to chill during sun set or early nite drinks at Seminyak beach,well there's a few next to it too. "
Helle F,"Roskilde, Denmark",Mar 2016,The sand is dark and it definitely isn't one of our favourite daytime beaches. But go just to have a drink and watch the sunset. The sunset here is beautiful and the atmosphere at night is fantastic.
nella253,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,The sad thing about Balinese beaches is the amount of rubbish about. Thankfully they have trucks and people trying to combat this problem on Seminyak beach. I didn't swim in the water this time but the sunsets were wonderful.
Tomek M,"Warsaw, Poland",Mar 2016,"Don't you ever come to Bali if looking for beautiful beaches. Crowded from vendors annoying you all day long, full of rubbish, dirty with brownish water. Extremely overpriced."
PA Deepak,"Visakhapatnam, India",Jan 2016,This Beach is very colorful and vibrant.This is very apt location for youngsters and who want to set a trend in the prawl.A place where you can find so many girls around.A good places for everyone as a wholesome.It treats everyone with its choice
DeborahMello,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2016,Beach is dirty and ugly.Went to Seminyak expecting to find a paradise beach and was frustrated. I was better enjoying the hotel pool than at the beach.If you want a beach experience go to Nusa Dua or Uluwatu regions
no(r)mandic,Groningen,Feb 2016,It is a very nice beach and we enjoyed swimming in the breakers. We were shocked by the prices of the sunloungers. 
Robert H,"Bunbury, Australia",Feb 2016,Not the best for swimming although tell that to the many who do. With the wet season the run off from the land is just too high and the rubbish etc is higher than normal.  The beaches are being tidied though but sometimes a fell their fighting a loosing battle. They must keep at it though.  A walk from Seminyak beach to Discovery Shopping Mall takes about an hour and a half walk. If the tides right and you have a bit of a head breeze it can be a beautiful walk.  
r_rladda,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,Beach is easily accessible and evenings are very pleasant. Plenty of beach shacks with live music at night. Do try parachute lamps :)
Liem T,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"People visit Seminyak Beach for the location. The beach itself is decent, but not wow-inducing by any means. It's crowded, but not as packed as Kuta Beach. And you will still be assaulted by throngs of itinerant salespeople. A brief ""makasih, tingal disini"" shall suffice.The surf is quite decent (beginner/intermediary depending on the swell) but beware: the current can be treacherous (way more than in Kuta Beach)."
ruru c,16 contributions,Mar 2016,Stayed in Seminyak for a week with our young child. Less hectic than Kuta. Restaurants top notch. Potato Head Beach Club a must go for food and sunset drinks. Will be coming back definitely. I love thefriendly Balinese nature.
YiliKR,"New York City, NY",Feb 2016,"Nice big beach that isn't dirty and full of trash unlike Kuta beach. Can rent beach lounge chairs with umbrellas, and the kids had a great time playing in the water and sand. Worth the visit! chez gado gado restaurant right ther as a good dining option as well."
Skimsa,"Bangkok, Thailand",Feb 2016,A stunning beach and a beautiful sunset. The bars and hotels that line it were amazing. The only problem is a lot of it was rough and closed so if you fancy a swim you need to be either strong or have a good day.
Errol S,"Forest Creek, Australia",Feb 2016,"It is great for a walk or to sunbathe but I had great concerns about water quality. There are a number of outlets from inland, washing all sorts of rubbish into the sea. It was not the rubbish you can see that bothered me however but what you can't see. I would strongly advise that if you did choose to swim, you not put your head under the water for obvious reasons or swim only in the hotel pools. There were a number of signs on the beach saying dangerous to swim. I was unsure if they meant danger of rips or danger from the effluent going into the sea. "
Roshni D,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,This place is great for watching sunsets. Has quite a many bars/beach side restaurants.But the beach is really dirty.
Hsphoser36,"Washington DC, DC",Feb 2016,"There is garbage and filth everywhere. Also, rivers with raw sewage run right through the beach. I ran here twice or maybe 3 times, and it was just disgusting. If you run far enough to the east, you will eventually get to a nicer color sand. However, near our hotel, this was just nasty."
hanaicha,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2015,having afternoon snack while waiting for sunset here. the view was pretty amazing. and it's not too crowd for enjoyable sunset-time.
Levilouicus,"Broome, Australia",Feb 2016,"Seminyak beach is less crowded than Kuta, still a lot of rubbish and debris in the ocean and on the shore.Nice enough to kick back and relax with a Bintang. Many resorts back into the beach.The wet season clouds make for a beautiful sunset."
Daniel B,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,Nice beach but they really do need to employ some locals to clean and maintain the beach. A lot of rubbish and building materials littering the beach.
Hassandoc90,"Aligarh, India",Feb 2016,"Centrally located, easy accessibility pretty decent food outlets good music. Best time would be sunrise and sunset. Less crowded than kuta beach."
AndrewTee78232,"San Antonio, TX",Dec 2015,"Lovely beach with fine sand, gentle breeze, and inspiring ocean front.  I like this beach better than Kuta beach.  It is cleaner, less commericialized, and much less crowded.  The hawkers seem gentler too so a person can walk around without too much hassle.  That said, there are ample ""fine"" eateries (fine dining now equals higher priced dining) with outstanding views of the beach and people in the beach.  This place is where you can have fine dining for about 10 USD in the Fall/winter of 2015"
slapstcik,singapore,Feb 2016,Very lively. Feel like jamming and listening to nice music with humble musicians (Just Us)... Playing on the beach.  from about 6-630pm onwards 
Russell B,"Caloundra, Australia",Feb 2016,"The beach in front of the resort was closed most days, probably rips or dumpers. There were surf schools near the resort but niot good surf."
TravelEatXplore,"Boston, MA",Feb 2016,"The water was really warm. The locals there are really nice. However, there are a lot of trash on the beach. I really hope the local officials take notice of the trash littering and clean it up."
Kyle A,112 contributions,Aug 2015,"The scenes there are lovely.  Great to watch the sun set.  There is a ridiculous amount of trash all over the place though, especially along the water line."
Teyam B,54 contributions,Aug 2015,"I loved this beach, the views are breathtaking. Great for surfing, you can rent lounge chairs if you're ok with spending the money. There's places to eat along the beach and watch the sun sets. The only thing I didn't like was the vendors walking around trying to sell things, they won't leave you alone so you have to be firm if you're not interesting in purchasing anything. "
Jeffsreview,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is nothing special, it is walking distance from a number of hotels. the sand is not clean white sand like you see on Australian beaches, but it is pleasant enough to sit back and relax on."
Hans v,"Goes, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,We have been to Bali a number of times in Jan/Feb and on every occasion on the Kuta - Seminyak beaches it is the same:nice beach but man what a lot of rubbish. Apparently it all washes in from the sea (plastics mainly) and the authorities (?) do not know how to handle it. Halfhearted attempts are made to clean up every now and again but nowhere near enough. I appreciate it's not an easy problem but with all that money poring in from the tourist industry I'm convinced a lot mre could be done.
T9176DFmarym,"West Wales, UK",Feb 2016,"Sea very rough, lots of red flags up, my partner did go in swimming  but as he was walking into the sea stepped into a large hole which was quite a shock.  Nice large expanse of beach to walk on but you did tend to sink in the sand."
brows_,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,"With a whole range of great restaurants, day clubs and hotels, Seminyak is a lovely area of Bali. Away from the hustle of rough tourists, it offers a surprising level of quality and professionalism. Great area to stay. "
WipamasBee,"Bangkok, Thailand",Feb 2016,Even they tried to clean the beach in the morning. But not every day got lots of plastics on the beach and in the water. Locals are nice and friendly. A peaceful beach sort of. 
EgleDesigns,"Shanghai, China",Feb 2016,"We didn't surf at Seminyak beach but walked it a lot. Great for running too. Like any other beach in the area, there are a lot of dogs running around, and they do leave their business in the sand, so mind your feet. What upset me was, westerns who own dogs here also put a blind eye to it. They don't clean after their dogs.There were quite a few storms out in the sea, so there was a lot of rubbish on the beach which is understandable, and in some areas it is being cleared all the time. However, I saw many people, especially locals just leaving their rubbish on the beach after watching the sunsets, even though the bins were right behind them. A bit upsetting. "
Dheeny,"Fujairah, United Arab Emirates",Feb 2016,"We went to the beach around Ku De Ta (enter from KuDeTa passage), recommended to go in the morning around 9 if you bring young kids or baby as the wave can be quite rough in the afternoon and the heat can be too much for them. You can rent beach chairs (2 chairs+1 umbrella) at IDR 100.000 for 3 hours and have sips of fresh coconuts (idr 30.000).I would say the beach is clean enough, it's not that you'd get tons of rubbish on ur foot as some reviews saying it's a dirty beach.. ;)"
Amanda N,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"You can't leave Bali without coming here! The atmosphere is so amazing, fun friendly faces, so much to see and do, restaurants, bars! Double Six Beach is the place to be!"
GiaRosen,"Atlanta, GA",Feb 2016,"We just walked along the beach, it was very nice and pretty popular full of kids relaxing, smoking and drinking - looked like a great day to spend a Sunday Funday.."
roomraid,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,"Without doubt the dirtiest beach I've ever experienced, water was full of rubbish and the beach was littered as far as the eye can see. My recommendation is to avoid it and just go sit in one of the resorts by the pool"
Tanya-Maree,"Waiheke Island, New Zealand",Aug 2015,Definitely not a swimming beach so be aware that if you book hotels near you cannot swim (too many rips).  Great for a walk on the beach or sunbathing.
Visinesti,"Vancouver, Canada",Feb 2016,"Free public beach. You need to rent lounge chair and umbrella. We were here during the rainy season and there were quite high waves, making it difficult to swim. Not very clean with debris washing up the shore."
Jack B,3 contributions,Jan 2016,It is a beautiful place and much cleaner than anything in Kuta. Not as many hagglers as well. Highly recommend!
Raskolnikow,"Neckartailfingen, Germany",Oct 2015,Wide and clean beach along Seminyak. It offers miles of walking and many opportunities for waves to learn surfing. If you go for a walk try to avoid the little “rivers” that flow into the see. The smell reveals that this is not fresh water.Unfortunately this is not the white dream beach with a backdrop of palm trees that you imagine when you dream of Bali.
Irene T,"Glasgow, UK",Feb 2016,I went here with my fiancé to relax for the day & it was amazing.  Really clean beach with lots of food places/stalls nearby.! Highly recommend ! 
gil749,"Kalgoorlie-Boulder, Australia",Jan 2016,Astonished at the filthy beach and locals using drains to beach as a toilet. All the people lazing around you'd think some of them could pick up on the beaches and though a fares.
Greg A,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Hard to beat at sunset. The most attractive of the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak strip of beaches.Although other posts have mentioned rubbish etc, it was clean when we were there (several visits, from 21-27 Jan 2016), although it rained every day. We were at the southern end - apparently the stream in the north near the temple can bring out rubbish after rain.Negotiate for umbrella lounges on the beach - we paid IDR50,000 for a 2-bed lounge, which is probably expensive, but, hey, for $5 all day, who cares? The same chap who sells you the lounge can also supply you with well-priced cold drinks (coke, beer, coconuts etc).Note for foreign tourists - you can't sit on the lounges for free 'just for 10 minutes', as we saw several tourists try to do, including a couple of female Australians who wanted to change their toddler's nappy (!). The lounges are rented, it's how those guys make their living - if they let everyone sit on the lounges 'just for 10 minutes', they wouldn't make a rupiah.There are some sellers trawling the beach, but they're not too pushy, and perhaps not as numerous as in Kuta and Legian.You can just sit on your towels on the beach for free, but you might get burnt that way.There are numerous beach shacks south of Jl. Camplung Tanduk, they are cheap and good for burgers, juices and beer.Surf is good for boogie boarding and body surfing. Gets a bit rough and erratic, with some cross-currents, at the end of low tide, be careful near the breakers at this time.If you're lucky enough to be from a place with outstanding beaches (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Hawaii, California),  you might think this beach is not much. But by world standards it is very pleasant and enjoyable. Recommended."
sharlinge,singapore,Dec 2015,The beach is pretty normal. Rather dirty sand in fact. Worth a skip unless you plan to chill at their bars. We witnessed a cremation ceremony there.  Interesting to see how people can throw the ashes and swim within such close proximity
Prit Swami,"Surat, India",Feb 2016,"Nothing in the beach, no rides, no shag, nothing to do, just a visit that to I'd time permits. As major hotels have their private beaches, so much crowd is expected. "
simone m,United Kingdom,Feb 2016,"nice beach, best palces to go if you want a subbed day our the private resorts with access to beaches, but this was our local beach, beach clean with many surfers, toilet access and food and beverage"
Paul B,Albury NSW Australia,Feb 2016,"all restaurant facities are fantastic, the food is great and the staff are freindly and helpful, it is the people of Bali who make the holiday experinec what it is - amazing"
Andrew P,"Mitcham, Australia",Feb 2016,"Yes, there are a fair bit of rubbish laying around, but grab a lounge and relax with a drink.   It's just an OK beach.  There are better places to sit at a beach restaurant - Jimbaran Beach seafood restaurants for example.  Seminyak Beach has the beachside cafes tho.  In good weather it's worth the trip.  "
Harold_J_Potter,"Byron Bay, Australia",Feb 2016,"I have to concur with some of the others who have reviewed this beach, in particular Leylandbros who reviewed only yesterday. I walked from my hotel this afternoon looking forward to a nice walk on the beach following a lovely few days in Ubud. My initial impression was ugh, but I  proceeded to walk hoping things would get better. In the end my partner and I were so disgusted by the amount of rubbish on the sand that we had to leave, vowing never to set foot on this beach again. I was horrified by the beaches of Sihanoukville but this is the Wes Craven version of horror! :-( "
sbstn1985,"Rome, Italy",Feb 2016,Only go there for sunset... if you want to spend a nice beach day go somewhere else like Uluwatu... or stay in your villa's pool!
Braucic B,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2016,"Know Seminyak beach for years, When was not busy and with famous 66 Club. Now the beach is much more touristic with plenty of good choices.One of my favorite.   "
Simone P,4 contributions,Feb 2016,"Perfect end to a sun soaked day! Bintangs and sunsets...🍻 lots of beach bars to choose from, with colourful beanbags and live music to chill to."
Leylandbros,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"It is rare for me to be so horrified and critical but my walk down the beach on the 4th of February, 2016, was shocking. Due to heavy rain the previous day, a huge amount of rubbish and waste had been flushed out into the waters of the beach. There were signs up saying that swimming was not permitted - due to the high levels of Coliforms in the water. Several of the Hotels were attempting to clean up some of the rubbish on the section of the beach. It seemed like a losing battle. It is so sad for the people of Bali that this happens on a regular basis. "
LindaMay,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Feb 2016,Have been to Seminyak several times and though still beautiful on high tide and sunset was disappointed how dirty many sections were on low tide.
mollercph,"Rawai, Thailand",Feb 2016,"The beach is filthy. Plastic bottles, cigarette buds and plastic bags every were. The lounge chairs are overpriced. The locals try to get somewhere between 50.000-200.000 IR.souvenir sellers bother you every five minutes and the restaurants and bars play loud music all day. Not much of the Balinese magic there.It's great for surfers. And I enjoyed a day in the sun on my Bintang towel in the sand. Was very happy to catch some rays after 4 days of rain and no sun."
Kennedy_Chimp,24 contributions,Feb 2016,"A nice sandy beach that's not too crowded, we reached the place at about 8, most of the crowd from sunset watching would have left. Nothing much to rave about, the seafood wasn't as cheap as acclaimed, neither was it good.The only saving grace was the corn, a man with his push cart peddling his corn with his kerosene lamp. That was the best corn I had, the ones in Kuta just didn't make the mark.Be sure to grab one when you're there!"
Matt C,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,Not my favourite beach in the world.Went on an overcast day so that didn't help sell it to me but over all this beach is fine but a bit dirty (rubbish). Plenty of medium sized surf (if that's what your into). Heaps of beachside bars with sofa beds / bean bags for you to crash out. Overall it's ok.  
Bachir M,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jan 2016,"i visited the beach in Jan 16 during the raining season, it's a great beach to walk along the coast and watch the sunset, during my visit the beach was full of big waves and surfers, very clean and visiting the beach is a must."
SanClemenRAM,"Quincy, MA",Feb 2016,"This is a nice beach with lots of sand and numerous local vendors looking to make a quick buck. You can buy beer, soda and chips. You can rent an umbrella/cabana. Numerous surfboard rentals. Or you can just walk the beach. The only off is the large amount of trash all over the beach. It is a tragedy that so much trash is polluted into the ocean and that the vendors don't help clean it up."
PearlySim,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2016,Splendid!  Love the beach and the swells. Be sure to take time to read the waves first before jumping in. 
Kat59623,United Kingdom,Mar 2015,"Long beach, not overcrowded. Beautiful scenery. Hot spot for all surfers and young people. Nice place!"
Eg007,"Bennebroek, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,We enjoyed it but please take the effort to get rid of all the rubbish on the beach and in the water.
Kruti B,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2016,Its one of the nice and clean beach with good amount of restaurants and cafes. Easy to reach and has great sunsets. The tides are relatively low so good to swim
haz2016,"Brunei-Muara District, Brunei Darussalam",Dec 2015,The beaches of Seminyak are simply divine! You see Nature's masterpiece everywhere you turn. Will definitely be back!
SCLaus85,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"The only stand-out was its sunsets. Otherwise the sand is quite dark, water was a bit rough and there was a bit of rubbish. Depends on the type of beaches you're used to experiencing, I guess. "
JamesLesmana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Nice to play at evening. Along the beach has many cafe, wide and long beach. A good spot for  viewing sunset"
lesley s,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,This beach was ok and a bit cleaner than some but too rough most of the time for an old wimpy non surfer! Some quirky beach cafes with colorful beanbag seats and umbrellas giving the place a nice vibe!
Josephine V,12 contributions,Feb 2016,We liked this beach especially after seeing Kuta Beach which was very dirty . the beach is large so the closer you are to Legian it gets a little dirty and busy but if you are Closer to Petingenget is quite and very nice . Also you don't have a million sellers following you . there are better beaches in Bali but it was a good experience .   
domfrase,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Feb 2016,"Good restaurants/ bars along the beach, great for sunset.  Like most southern beaches in Bali more rubbish than you would expect, and at night they open water from the city into the sea, from the smell as it goes in I will never swim here again!  Further north a little cleaner I think, but still got sick after swallowing too much water failing at learning to surf.  Slightly less crowded than Kuta, more than Berawa."
Em T,"Bulleen, Australia",Jun 2015,Seminyak doesn't have the nicest beaches. Nusa Dua (although a fair distance away) is where i would recommend if you'd like to go swimming in crystal clear blue water and bake on golden sand. Seminyak beach has choppy waves (similar to the gold coast) and is overall not as pleasant. 
Nicole C,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"This was the beach where my partner proposed to me (in a quieter area with no hagglers) was beautiful! Almost no rubbish compared to Kuta which was covered in rubbish. We hired beach chairs for 50,000 IDR (around $5 AUS) for 2 hours and beers were around $2.50 each for a Bintang aswell so made the day nice and relaxing. Prepare to get hassled by people selling stuff but just say no or ignore them and continue relaxing. "
Callum C,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,Great beach to visit in the rainy season. Kuta & legion beaches were full of rubbish from the weather. however it seemed to be a lot less in Seminyak and also beach restaurants had bean bag settings in the afternoon which was cool.
A. N. S,31 contributions,Feb 2016,"Seminyak is a great place for surfing, chill out at the bars with live music performance. Plenty of bars around there. You can buy a drink at the restaurant and get a shaded umbrella instead of renting sun bed. Surfing board can be rented at rp 40000 an hour. Instructor will cost rp 50000 an hour."
Dave Alexius,"East Java, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"I went here just want to see the famous Seminyak Beach. I came before noon, unfortunately there were not so many people there. I think it must be crowded in the afternoon when peoples want to see the sunset at the beach. Around the beach you can find luxury hotels and restaurants."
Aaron W,25 contributions,Feb 2016,"After being to all the beautiful beaches between Nusa dua and Uluwatu, this was a real let down. Went for a walk along here, was abysmal. Really dull looking beach littered with rubbish. "
Helena Yuri S N,16 contributions,Feb 2016,"Seminyak is the best place I love to visit. Not too crowded but enjoyable life here. Beautiful beach with some good atmosphere of beach clubs like potato head, kudeta, Woobar to spend time waiting sunset"
Jean-Maxime T,35 contributions,Feb 2016,"The Seminyak beach is a really nice beach. But with all the people there, it's hard to really enjoy the calm or the ocean. There is also several people trying to sell stuff all the way and everywhere. Not the kind of beach to relax. Good place to enjoy a drink or beer. In february, the ocean is hard to swim at this place."
NevyLam,"London, UK",Jan 2016,"We went on 5 different beaches in Bali, but liked this one. Water is very clean also the beach is kept clean. It is not crowded and you can enjoy the sun in peace. Ignore all the sellers by just saying ""thank you"" and they will not disturb you more. Nearby is a lot fof restaurants and coffee shops, also taxis."
egginton2015,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,There is no real direction to the beach in seminyak. One end is carpark and the other is through the hotels and resorts. There is no board walk as such. If your staying in one of the hotels on the beach that would be fine.
Sonya H,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"Walked five minutes down the road from our hotel to Seminyak beach and what a disappointment!! Black sand, stray dogs sleeping under chairs, rubbish and hawkers selling their wares. Only upside was the water was warm. Preferred to stay at our hotels man made beach"
Marianna K,"Brisbane, Australia",Feb 2016,"We walked from Kuta to Seminyak via Legian, it was quite long walk but worth it! Very crowded places but the sceneries were unique and beautiful! Night walk on the beach was very pleasant with lights from resorts and sounds of wave although it was rainy. "
Jen R,"Alameda, CA",Feb 2016,We arrived here walking up the path at sunset. Having come from ubud it was surreal dripping into the beach party that was going on but we didn't hesitate! Drinks and apps at la plancha were great. Fun friendly people to talk to not. Next morning came down again and walked about a mile checking out the waves. The water is so warm it's like a bathtub. There are several surf schools including a Riptide school that looked fun. Cost approx $60-$85usd. Disappointing amount of litter washed up along the beach. The restaurants nearer us like la plancha clear it away. I think the restaurants and resorts should all pitch in the clean up the beach. Good for business and for the environment. Hawkers were there but pleasant and didn't keep pushing after you say no unlike what we experienced in ubud. 
Velarie,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,Nice view and lively area..though dogs are running freely there too. Be careful on their poops at your feet too.
naunidhsingh,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2016,Anyone who wantsto stay away from the hustle bustle of Kuta should definitely try Seminyak. Much more upscale and full of good restaurants and cafes unlike the loud area of Kuta.
BaliTiger2,"Balikesir, Turkey",Jan 2016,"This is my local beach. At the Petitenget Temple car park. Beautiful LA Lucciola is here for Italian dining.The resorts on the beach work hard to keep the beach clean but after a rain, it can be daunting. I find around May/June that I can't walk along the beach because of high tides that make the sand very steep and soft"
Chandangoyal,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Dec 2015,"I visited seminyak in dec, 2015. Very beautiful views from the beach. the weather is amazing. Overall a very wonderful experience"
emzeperx,"Nelson, New Zealand",Jan 2016,"Does not offer too much, though quite relaxing. At least definitely less litter here than at other beaches. Great for a big walk"
ccelan,"Baltimore, MD",Jan 2016,"We stayed at an amazing hotel on Seminyak Beach - I have no complaints and would return in a heartbeat- that being said the beach is quite dirty with dog poo and other litter being brought in from the ocean. Maybe if the tides were different, the beaches would be a bit cleaner. I did love how many people walked early in the morning and watched the sun set in the evening, such a wonderful community. "
Highkit,"Leeds, UK",Jan 2016,"Great beach to walk along and just take in the view, especially the sunset. Parts of the beach are cleaned regularly but a lot of debris builds up after a storm. Offerings are placed on the beach near the river from Seminyak. Take notice of the lifeguard flags on the beach because the tides can be very strong.  Bella located near the Breeze sells good sarongs but bargaining is required."
JohnTGN,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"As we walked along one morning from our hotel we sad to see how many plastic bags and dead fish were found on the beach! It's a disgrace to be frank and local governments need to take action. The waters are warm and overall the beach is nice and great for a stroll, but I was so sad to see these poor fish and even an old turtle that had washed up along with plastic bags. The local hotels have a great location on the beach and a real asset in the beach that needs much love and care!"
star5_11,"Inverness, UK",Jun 2015,"Lovely beach at sunset, great cheap bars along the beach as well as the W Hotel for cocktails would recommend"
preplady,Virginia,Jan 2016,"very wide & beautiful beach. Great for taking long strolls.  We were there in mid-day, but I bet sunsets would be great here.  Only odd thing:  only saw two doves during maybe 2 hours there, no seagulls, no sandpipers, no anything else.  Wonder why not!"
Adam T,Venice,Dec 2015,"The beach is a nice beach not the white sands that you get in Thailand, but lots of places to stop by for a drink and watch life go by."
Angela E,Buckingham,Jan 2016,"Staying for 8 nights - finding it very organised, comfortable and clean.  Probably just a little impersonal for us to re visit. "
SalvaTravel,Melbourne,Jan 2016,"I wasn't particularly impressed with Seminyak beach, I did go for a walk most mornings on my visit to Bali past it though it did appear quite dirty at times. "
Greg R,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",Jan 2016,"The beach is not like a white sand pacific beach, personally I didn't like it and opted to swim at our villas pool.A lot of the beach was closed off to swimmers due to rips, remember to swim between the flags.There were also lots of flies and hawkers!"
michlaz21,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"Great beach for morning walks, you will find local and tourist enjoying the morning walks, jogs and surf In the morning.  In the evening you have the perfect setting to watch the sunset! "
esptm,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,Walked down for a quick look after dinner.  Very pretty with lanterns from the restaurants. Strong waves.
Robert F,4 contributions,Jan 2016, Just Pick a Restraunt have a drink arrive before 5pm and watch the sunset and all the action of Bali unfold. 
akm515,"Windsor, UK",Jan 2016,The beach is impressive. It's not white sand and crystal water by its clean and there are plenty of loungers and a good price. The guys that run the loungers have a good selection of drinks and hire body boards at a very reasonable price. There are some good bars along the beach apparently but we didn't make it that far. We did eat in a restaurant just off the beach which was very good. Definitely worth a look for a swim to cool down from the intense heat and fun if you like waves. 
Natalie C,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"Great night out spent by the beach, relaxing on the provided bean bags listening to live music in the background until sunset then into the night. A selection of eateries to choose from whilst on the beach, from local food to pub style food.  Couldn't ask for a better night.. "
LittleNickyA,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,I love coming down to Seminyak beach at any time of day. It's beautiful to walk or swim first thing in the morning before breakfast when the beach is super quiet. It's great to spend the day here and have lunch at the warungsalong the beach and perfect for sunset drinks 
sammybeel,"Bells Beach, Australia",Jan 2016,"This beach is clean compared to most of the other beaches in bali. I've been traveling to bali for thirty years and the water is getting clogged with rubbish!! For some reason Seminyak beach is free of rubbish. The beach it self is great, I've always been able to get a fun wave here and generally to my self. Overall it's a great beach for everyone!"
Michelle S,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,"The water is warm and the sand burns your feet so make sure you wear thongs. Seminyak Beach is a great swimming beach for the young and old and the odd Bali dog that came's down to cool off due to the heat and humidity(I'm sure 1 dog I was watching was trying to body surf). My son hired a surfboard for 2 weeks which cost him $10.00 a day and my 14 year old daughter tried her hand at surfing a longboard for $5.00 an hour. The hawkers can be a tad annoying, wanting you to buy more sarongs, elephant trinkets, glasses and watches, but if they don't ask you once they will ask you 100 times. There are some great bars and restaurants along the beach too that have great food and acoustic bands to listen too and the Sunset is just perfect. "
Chris S,"Seattle, WA",Jan 2016,"Title says it all, little more upscale with a string of beach front restaurants,  many of which offer live nightly music.  Great place to watch the sunset or the night fishers.  Fewer hawkers than kuta but they're all present. "
Donna B,"Bunbury, Australia",Jan 2016,"Staying at double six hotel has allowed us to use the beach daily for running and swimming which has been wonderful.The beach is clean without any rubbish in the oceanPerfect for swimming, the current is strong swimmers need to be aware of the undertow"
allison9723,"New York City, NY",Dec 2015,"You don't go to Seminyak for the beach. You go for the upscale restaurants and shopping. Which are amazing. The beach has a few nice clubs on it for sunset watching, but in terms of pretty, don't expect much. "
kate b,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jan 2016,"white sand with gentle waves and when the tide is out...you can walk for miles.  follows aroud Seminyak, so many places to stop for coffee, drinks or dining. "
Janelle T,"Woolooware, Australia",Jan 2016,"Got sun lounges and umbrellas 6 for 200,000 rupiah. Water was cold and only 10,000 rupiah. Water was clean. Surf not overly big"
Theadventuresofliv,"Shanghai, China",Dec 2015,"Not my favourite beach but it's better than some of the others along the kuta, seminyak front. The best beaches are out on Bukit Peninsula or even down Cangu way. "
Cara Holland,"Croydon, Australia",Feb 2015,"It was a nice beach to look over from the hotel pool, or walk up late evening to see sunset, but too many people trying to sell crap made us avoid it for the most part. Also its quite dirty from the storm water from streets, I wouldnt swim there. The beers in the bean bags at night are nice though!"
Keithbath D,"Chippenham, UK",Dec 2015,"Plenty to do here with eating places around, not always cleaned to perfection but worth a visit beware of sales touts which can be annoying"
ratnadws,"Malang, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"I waste my time with my friend in seminyak and when the sunset come, we went to seminyak beach for enjoy the sunset view. its too awesome!!"
Grahame_11,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"I have to admit I didn't like it when all the bar/restaurants starting opening along this stretch of the beach. But now it seems to be a great place to drop by as the sun sets, stroll along with a bit of low key haggling if you are badly in need of a carved coconut shell, a genuine $5 rolex or a $2 pair of sunnies that your being asked $20 for.Then after your stroll hop on a bean bag and drink the amber liquid. Really pleasant way to end the day.Oh, and I think the very best way to start the day is a vigorous walk, get the heart rate up a little, then do a few sprints up the dunes to really get the blood moving. Drop down and do a push up or a plank. Do any of the above. But make sure to take in the crisp curling waves drumming out the beat for a brand new Bali day."
Karen E,"Glenelg, Australia",Jan 2016,"Spent the new years eve on the beach watching the sunset as 2015 turned to 2016...fireworks all around us , the air filled with the sounds of laughter and many different languages...amazing experience...magic.."
David H,Stanmore,Oct 2015,What a beautiful and compelling resort. The beach and surrounding town has everything from great beach clubs to every cuisine you could wish for in the town as well as amazing and varied night life. Beautiful hotels and stunning scenery.
dumbquestion,"Athelstone, Australia",Jan 2016,"Golden sand, slight swell, a bit of a rip between the red flags, and people swimming. What more does one need. A bit cleaner perhaps."
Albert M,"Lisbon, Portugal",Jan 2016,Quite liked this beach.  Was wonderful to spend the day and swim.  Sunsets are breath taking.  Many vendors but they don't bother you to much.  Didn't feel to crowded.  You could either partake in the scene or not.  
Leigh H,"The Ponds, Australia",Jan 2016,"I you would like a safe beach paddle around at, this is the one for you. easy double break waves that are great for small and old."
Emily S,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Accessible by every major hotel and a place to chill or be served chilled drinks, perhaps even some beach side yoga if thats your thing... If you are in the area you cannot miss the beach!"
mskatie1959,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"Love all the Bars with choices of tables & chairs or bean bags on the sand. Bean bags are best. Live entertainment most nights.  Food good & not expensive, beer prices not much more than you pay at a mini-mart.  Great to spend a hot night there cooling off, enjoying the beautiful sunsets. "
HayleyLauren,"Redhill, UK",Aug 2015,"Went here for a day whilst travelling with friends in August 2015. It was a nice day at the beach, not too busy and not too many people pestering us to buy things so we could relax. It was quite clean too. The area we sat in didn't have many places nearby to buy food and drinks from but I'm pretty sure there was lots further down. I don't surf but there were lots of people surfing and the waves looked pretty good for it. Definitely worth a visit."
Jenny T,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,The view was the best. You can see the reflection of the sky on the sand with a thin layer of the sea water. 
Clairetwicks,"Twickenham, london",Jan 2016,"Very chilled. Dark coloured sand due to it being a volcanic island. Indian Ocean so lots of big waves! It is so much fun jumping them😊 there are a few sun loungers with umbrellas, usually you will pay around Rp 150,000 to use, do not be scared to barter! It is fantastic at night with a couple of chilled bars playing live music. "
Daniel F,"Taipei, Taiwan",Dec 2015,"long and vast beach, good for jogging. garbage gets cleaned every morning. some locals sell coconuts (yumm). in the evening many peopel at the beach watching the sunset and kids playing in the waves. Great fun."
David R,Sydney,Jan 2016,"Like with the whole beach stretch in the area, it is now filled with ""bean bag bars"" and beach hawkers. While it is a bit cleaner than the stretch toward Kuta, a beach is a beach. Great spot to relax and watch the sunset if you are in the area."
Benjamin W,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,Great sunset but the beaches are full of rubbish here. White sand beaches do exsist in Bali but not here. 
kapshure,SF,Feb 2015,"I actually traveled to Bali in 2006, but this was a very beautiful beach to be experienced and enjoyed. The sunsets in Bali are amazing, as well as the food, and the people were above friendly to me in every way. I dream about returning to Bali often"
linggar87,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jan 2016,Bali never fails when come to sunset. It's always perfect. Really enjoying spend our time here. You can enjoy the sunset at the nearly cafe.
95laura372,"London, UK",Jan 2016,A nice easy way to have a relaxing couple of days. Some great Beach sellers with whom you can have some good banter. The sea is rough at times my partner nearly lost his swimmers a couple of times. Some nice bars and restaurants to loose a few hours with good food and Bingtang.
jacqueline f,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"We arrived just as most tourists where heading home , so less crowds. The beach was clean, not to many sellers. You do have to buy chairs etc but that's normal. So cheap."
Duncananan,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,Spoilt by beaches in Australia I can only rate this one as average. The breeze off the water and the open space were fabulous after a day in the heat and humidity in town. The water looked pretty rough but was quite warm round the ankles - trying to avoid stepping on rubbish was a bit tedious.
Quarnda,"Houston, TX",Oct 2015,My girls and I took a million pictures. the most fun I have ever had at a beach in my life!!! definitely a must see
Jaad87,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"Can be very crowded and touristy. Nice to watch the sunset. Many bars have live music playing, why they insist on playing western music covers i will never understand.. pricier than local places.."
Alex  B,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Oct 2015,Cool beach with lots of eating spots along the beachfront. Most of them have some live acoustic music too. Make sure you sit in the middle of the mix so you don't get music from the place next to you
Erik D,"Pasig, Philippines",Jan 2016,This beach is very crowded and it needs a lot of litter-clearning.  I was walking around beach and you could see all kinds of trash stuck in the blackish gray sand.  It's a good thing that Bali had a lot more to offer aside from this beach.
privali,Cooktown,Jan 2016,"Fantastic fireworks on NYE, completely mad!  Spent several evenings for sunset and drinks.  Plenty of eating and drinking options, beach long and wide, room for everyone.  Colourful and alive."
jbdave,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"Beach was clean when we were there.  Sunsets were beautiful, and having dinner on the sand at the local restaurant was pretty awesome.Make sure you negotiate a price to rent the deck chairs.  There can be a difference between the vendors.  That said, for a few bucks, to have someone bringing you down drinks all day is quite relaxing.   Especially when a nice ocean breeze comes on.  The biggest problem (as with all beaches in Bali) are the vendors that hassle you continuously to buy their products.  Mind you, my wife wasn't complaining while getting a foot massage."
Petros14,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2016,"great beach and easier to exercise than the street, get there early it does get busy. Great surfing lessons if that is what your after as well"
katjo9393,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2016,its a real shame since the beach looked realy good and has a great view of the sunset but its was so dirty so we didn't stay very long
Y.E.S,Australia,Jan 2016,It was a good beach. You are able to purchase some shade... Rent an umbrella. It is worth it since the sun is blazing. Close to the markets. Surfing lessons are available for you as well and if you are a surfer then surf boards for rent to you. 
Maninder K,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,beautiful place one of my favorite place to go.words are less to describe the beauty .love Balinese beach bars 
Fiona K,"Stockholm, Sweden",Dec 2015,Lots of rubbish on the beach which has come down from the highlands.  Would be a lovely beach if the local authorities stopped making excuses and got the rubbish and recycling under control in Bali. I understand why everyone stays in the pool. 
Beviho,"Stavanger, Norway",Dec 2015,Best place to watch the sunset! They replace all the sun-lounges in the evening with big bean bag chairs and you can sit with a nice drink and enjoy the sunset. Lots of people and lots of music. Also great for an after sunset swim if you have had enough sun all day.
LesleynD,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Coming from Western Australia, nothing beats our sunset. Most of the time we were there it was cloudy so not much of a sunset to wow us. Too busy and those beach side bars play really loud music. Too many beach vendors and not very clean beach although they try to clean it up, still heaps of rubbish washed up."
Ruth G,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,Stunning sunsets while sitting on the beach having a cold beer that can be purchased from one of the many vendors. New Years Eve was spectacular with fire works all along the beach as far as the eyes could see Potato head to the right and Kuta to the left
Ty chi,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,We walked along the beach a few times to go to Potato Head and to get back to our villa. We found that there are less hawkers along this beach so it makes for a more peaceful beach outing. The sunset was also a sight to behold.
Nessb80,"South Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"We're from Perth so not quite the white sandy beaches we have at home still get gorgeous sunsets. Gets really busy with bikes and cars walking to the beach. Walking on the sand seemed safe enough only your feet do get pretty dirty. They clean the beach in the morning I think. Although we only ever went in the evening wasn't too bad aside from New Years Day night. I personally wouldn't swim there as I'm freaked out by the black sand and not being able to see the bottom, but there were quite a few swimmers and surfers. It's pretty cool to sit in one of the many bars on bean bags where you still get a great view without sitting right on the black sand. "
chrls_m,"Tamworth, Australia",Jan 2016,Clean and well maintained beach.Beach lounges available to hire.Beach massage.Lots of hawkers.Resturants on the beach.Safety flags.Great swimming.Prepare for the sun and wind.
MARKtheSPARKY,"Bundaberg, Australia",Jan 2016,Too packed with everyone letting off fireworks didn't feel safe at all. I'm sure on a normal night or day would be a great place just went on a busy time! 
Marcia L,Melbourne,Jan 2016,"Seminyak beach is filthy and so is the water. The idea of swimming or relaxing here is unthinkable. It should be cleaned up. It would be a simple matter to organise a Clean up Seminyak Beach event, and I read in one of the local What's On magazines that there is such an event. If it exists, it's not working. Littering should be penalised, as there is litter everywhere."
kcr852,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2015,"The beach is crowded, but it's still beautiful. Loads of hotels where you can pop in and out of the loo / to grab a drink if needed.Rented two deck chairs + a body board for 150k for around 4-5 hours to the far right of Ku De Tah, which was decent enough, though you could probably get it lower if you tried harder.Sunset is wonderful from here - an absolute stunner. Just make sure you get a close seat to the sea unless you want people in your pictures :)"
Waz M,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,"Seminyak beach is clean, open and easy to get to. Hotels on the beach front are easy to slip in and out of for drinks and fun."
3kidsStavanger,Stavanger,Dec 2015,"Its Bali, the beach offers all you could want in terms of sunning, walking, swimming, surfing, happy hour options, etc.  We spent a lot of time there, and no complaints....but, was disappointed that so few of the private/public beaches were routinely cleaned after the days high tides.  Surrounded by all this greatness but you walk along a lot of trash and have things brushing up on your leg as you wade in the water.  No reason/excuse for this given the availability of cheap labor, equipment that can clean large areas quickly, etc.  Only real negative of our entire visit."
Raincityguy,"Vancouver, Canada",Dec 2015,"Seminyak offers a fabulous flat sandy beach that most days is overrun with visitors.  Like many other tropical beaches this one has its share of trash that you have to step around : plastic bags and bottles, discarded food containers, bits of clothing.  So much money is made by the local businesses you would think that they would spend a little to clean up the treasure that nature has provided.    "
Luana C,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"A fabulous beach to walk along and visit iconic Seminyak eateries such as KU DE TAH, Potato Head, W Hotel and more. The waters are quite rough, so swim at your own risk- some areas are patrolled; there are many surfers too. There can be a lot of rubbish when there has been a storm. A great beach walk!!"
tukangbaso,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,We went here for enjoying the sunset. Rent 2 beach chair for 100k and drinking cold beer while enjoying the sunset right in front of us. Paradise!
Payangan 1969,"Okinawa City, Japan",Jan 2016,"We spent New Year's Eve on this beach. Was a fab beach. Was busy being the end of the year. Plenty of seats bean bags. On the night it's self bean bags can be used with minimum spend of 150,000 rupiah. Not sure if this is the same cost throughout the year. Next morning tractors cleaned the beach so it became spotless once again"
Ashleigh_Auld89,"Hertfordshire, UK",Jan 2016,"Nice beach, not hassled, lots to do (surf / swim / bars) or just chill out. Telling me to write more but not much more to write :)"
Juan C,"Sunshine West, Australia",Jan 2016,"I went a couple of times to the beach but didn't get in the water, big waves mostly for surfers. Sand dirty, it seems tractors are not used everyday to clean the rubish.  Lots of sun shades and sunbathing stretchers for 3 AUD but you need to bargain otherwise you'll be paying 20 in AUD .Crowded in this time if the year.New year at the beach watching the fireworks was fine.Some good restaurants others not good at all.Smells like sweage in some areas.Anyway just average.Judge by yourself."
HaSiKh,Philippines,Dec 2015,"It is a great beach but just like all beaches are. Mornings are great and so are the evenings with fantastic colors in the sky; and an awesome sunset. What makes it interesting is the party scene in the evenings during sunset. The beach is relatively clean. At various places there are small hut-like restaurants that offer chairs and towels for rent - about IDR 50k for an hour. Drinks like Bintang usually cost about IDR 25k. At some places, the beach is cleaner as it is in front of an expensive resort like ku-de-ta or potato head and the likes.The party scene lights up during evenings with colorful bean bags all over the place, colorful people on it and the colorful sky ... all making the place really colorful. The place is like a music fest of sorts in the evenings. Wonderful to be here during that time. Mornings are serene and great for a run. Sun rises from the other side and hence the coolness is longer in the mornings making it ideal for a run.In short, OK beach, not the best in the world. Great for partying and overall feel."
jaye_w,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2015,"Hip, cafe culture. Good restaurants. Surf wear shops galore. May be good to grab a meal or chill at the numerous sports bars around the area. "
Marea J,"Woollahra, Australia",Apr 2015,The beach was very dirty as was the water. We saw a number of dead animals on the beach and a lot if rubbish. Not the place for swimming or relaxing.
Triana S,42 contributions,Dec 2015,"We love this beach because so beautiful and so clean. Easy to find good hotel, good shops, good restaurants and coffee shops.Suitable place for couple, family with kids and large groups. "
Ceilidh A,"Canberra, Australia",Jan 2016,Walking along a beach is allows nice though the rubbish detracted from the experience a bit. We rented a beach bed under an umbrella in a clean section and it was really enjoyable. 
D_R_SydneyAU,Sydney,Dec 2015,Wouldn't come to this beach other than to watch the sunset.  Water warm but the beach was quite dirty. Rubbish everywhere. I guess blame it on the people rather than the beach. Even saw a syringe :( the sunset was amazing though. Pull up a beanbag at one of the beach bars with a drink and just enjoy.
Samuel R,"Fairy Meadow, Australia",Dec 2015,"Visited briefly and it looked really nice, but just very hectic with tourists as to be expected in Seminyak."
priyakumar2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,The Seminyak beach has many good restaurants. It was very vibrant and especially the sunset dining was great.
sbak85,"Nilai, Malaysia",Jan 2015,"The beach is beautiful, less crowded than Legian Beach..You can come here just for relaxing..One of the top beach in Bali"
Jennifer V,"Sequim, WA",Dec 2015,"When dreaming of Bali we anticipated lazy days of the beach, which is where we headed out first thing when we arrived. We were so disappointed with the trash all over the beach, the swimming prohibition flags, and lack of any good place to lay out and make a good beach day possible. After less than an hour by the ocean we reevaluated our priorities and planned to spend the rest of our stay visiting the cultural sights instead."
Leah B,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great beach at night Balinese families and travellers all mingle and relax  watching the sunset  , beautiful location "
BSWAustralia,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Dec 2015,"Our son did some surfing here with one of the locals. He is quite competent but needed someone to help with the local conditions. Would suit a beginner though. Importantly, there's a flagged and patrolled area outside the Oberoi Hotel for swimming where the undertow is a little less than elsewhere. There is some litter on the beach (but they clean outside the larger hotels incl the Oberoi) so those spots are cleaner and remember the sand is dark - but don't be put off. It's also great for a morning or afternoon walk. Hawkers are few and far between and the few that are there are not pushy."
42carl,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Beautiful beach in Seminyak Bali, it's in between Kuta and petitenget beach and it's just perfect to chill here."
DanielC,16 contributions,Nov 2015,"We liked this beach. We hired an instructor to teach us surfing. You can chose from local instructors or schools (lot of options). Waves were quite big, excellent for surfing. "
Anjusg,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,Seminyak beach was bit let down. Nice beach but could be cleaner. Though it was buzzing with nightlife and activitities and it was enjoyable to soak in the atmosphere. The sea was beautiful but you have to watch when you walk for waste on the beach. 
rodrigoelp,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Some of our first days in Bali and decided to take a walk to the nearest beach from our hotel, eventually made our way through several streets into the beach but not before having our bags checked by police, that was something quite bizarre until my partner explained to me that Bali has changed quite a lot since the terrorist attacks in 2002 and 2005.In any case, walked into the beach just to notice a sea of rubbish being washed ashore. Told my missus I wanted to take a swim but as I was getting closer four plastic bags discouraged my attempt to which we started to walk along the beach. If you happen to walk close to any hotel/pub/bar you will see a little more variation on the type of rubbish, ranging from bottles and smoke buds to condoms (I was lucky enough to just find the aluminium packaging.)Getting close to The Oberoi hotel (or whatever it was) no less than 6 people were laying on the beach under clear influence of way too much booze, two of them screaming obscenities to people walking around. Another couple under a similar situation minus the obscenities after that hotel and a lot more towards the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa... we arrived at the beach around 4:30pm so all this probably happened between 4:30pm to 6pm?We end up going back to the hotel and crashing by the pool.I got no idea if Bali has become some kind of tourism dumpster in which people comes here to release any kind of inhibition while locals consent any behaviour in exchange of a constant stream of money from their wallets... at least in Seminyak."
Frankview,Singapore,Dec 2015,The waves are very strong in Seminyak and hence time in the ocean would be limited. However the view of the strong waves lashing Seminyak is one of the best in Bali and that in itself demands a visit.
filippos p,"Athens, Greece",Dec 2015,Nice beach with every you need...very good for me because of the serfing possibility. . We have of course in greece very beautiful beaches but not these special waves. ...
Joycedos,"Johannesburg, Gauteng, South Africa",Dec 2015,Unfortunately this beach is dirty. We had a stroll along beach not very pleasant dog walkers let dogs mess on beach and don't pick up. 
MissRoxy17,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"the beach has too much litter and its not really a safe swimming beach. the sand is that blackish sand, maybe i'm just spoilt by living in WA! Went to Nusa Dua last year and the beaches are  better there. "
Devine P,"Bac Ninh, Vietnam",Jul 2015,"My family chose Seminyak beach as our main overnight place during our trip to Indonesia according to my friends' recommendation. The choice was right absolutely. The beach was clean, wide sandy beach with diversified services and beach entertaiment that we enjoyed. Stayed in W retreat resort by the beach front and we were really happy. The beach has not much tourists as other beaches in SE Asia we've stayed."
Trevor K,"South Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"I'm sure most travellers to Bali must be shocked at the current state of the main beaches.  Both Seminyak and Legian beaches were covered with trash, both in and out of the water - so much so that we avoided these beaches.The exception is the space in front of some of the major hotels, presumably they employ people to clean them.Hard to fathom why the local authorities haven't addressed this issue, it is a major blight on Bali. Would recommend heading out to Batu Bolong for your beach / surf fix, it is almost pristine."
Amar N,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,We stayed at a hotel overlooking Seminyak beach and loved it!!There were enough waves for some amateur surfing and body boarding but not too big to stop any kids from being able to play in the water.Long beautiful beach stretch also made it great for a morning run.
SedaEg,Istanbul,Aug 2015,"Out of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak; Seminyak is the one with access to high-end beach clubs and hotels. However, Legian is better situated, waves are both for surfing and playing in water. There are more beach side warrungs and more sunbeds. Seminyak isn't bad either as long as you are chilling at one of the beach clubs."
Macpheejil,"Madrid, Spain",Dec 2015,"Been there, enjoyed the moment, nearly been blown away by the strong wind as we were there during the raining season.  However, found that many of the other tourist do enjoy surfing..."
MarTravels16,"Redhill, UK",Dec 2015,"A nice beach lined with lots of wonderful bars and restaurants. Be careful when walking on the 'promenade' as bikes happily rush past you. Littering does appear to be a slight problem however the view does compensate for this. Visit if you are close by, but save the travel from elsewhere."
Navneet04,72 contributions,Dec 2015,"If you're travelling from another Bali just to visit this beach, then it's not worth it. Kuta Beach would be better. Lots of trash on Seminyak Beach and it's not really swim-able either."
Em Engel,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,"Hired some comfortable beach chairs, slathered on some factor 30 and spent a beautiful day on Seminyak beach. It's not a great beach for swimming, but the water is pleasant for a quick dip."
ceeceedeeuk,ceeceedeeuk,Dec 2015,"This beach is ruined by the huge amount of rubbish on the shore. It makes it completely unappealing for swimming. This is something that needs to be addressed on a major scale. With no central rubbish collection, locals throw items into rivers and it ultimately washes up on Seminyak (and other) beaches. My view is probably marred by the pristine Australian beaches i'm used to, but I'd avoid this spot. it was really pretty gross."
Cindy O,"Makassar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,I thinks this beach is New Kuta Beach. We spent 15-20 minutes ride motorbike from Legian to Seminyak. Enjoying sunset on this beach is very great experience. 
frances b,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,"The very ew is quite amazing, don't always buy food at the restaurants along the beach go for a walk and get some of the tasty cobs of corn cooked by the vendors it is very tasty and cheap."
Thorpie77,87 contributions,Dec 2015,I have a preference for clean beaches - shame so much rubbish on these beaches. Good place to watch sunset - get a little tired of saying no thanks constantly for massages etc...
vickyvic,36 contributions,Dec 2015,I like seminyak beach better than kuta beach. Better view to watch sunset and not messy. In the context of messy crowd (beach boys with their rental boards and selling beers). Not white sand though.Written by : aventuracognitio.wordpress.com
TerenceSingapore,Singapore,Dec 2015,"I like this beach not just because it's extremely  central and accessible, but because it has character and life. Compared with the overly commercial Kuta Beach, it has a better vibe. Even though there are many hotels, resorts, beach clubs, along the stretch of beach, especially from the Double Six to the Dhyana Pura areas, the beach still offers a waterside stretch that's great for photo taking, watching dogs (and horses) frollick in the sand, flying kites, or just strolling along the water's edge. Sunset is of course the favourite time of the day to lounge on one of the beanbag chairs provided by the beach clubs."
David P,"Austin, TX",Dec 2015,"Restaurants and more restaurants and then  some - definitely for the younger generations- unless you like loud music, some crowds and average food. Close to a number of hotels so it is convenient for all. "
gaurav0811,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,Beach is clean and there are many good cafes on the beach where one can enjoy the food and drinks. Cafes on the beach are open till mid night and one can have a good sunset view. 
tofanoink,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"one of famous beach in bali, and there's so many famous cafe sorounding. you can see beautiful sunset here while enjoying snacks and beer :)"
Shobhit B,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2015,"this is a beautiful beach, with great crowd around. there are a bunch of bars playing good music. A walk in the evening could be very romantic! "
lovetravelslove,"Hong Kong, China",Mar 2015,"Hubbi and I knew we can't lounge for long at the beach...so we only wanted the beach chairs and umbrellas for a couple of hours and we were upfront about the short stay...still, we probably discussed with six different vendors and everyone of them was charging USD10 or more for the few hours we wanted to stay, crazy!!!We ended up sitting at one and got our price down to USD 8 per chair...for a bit over 2 hours we stayed :(Bali is so over-rated with tourists, it's often frustrating for travelers."
Sedek87,26 contributions,Sep 2015,Try look at private beach due it less crowded. Open beach is bit pack with people and slightly not secure.
Purrplehaze,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,Sunset by the beach was amazing from these two locations. Its a must visit destination for every traveler looking for a fabulous beachy time
thataussiecouple,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Seminyak Beach is nice, however it does not live up to the standards of beaches back in Australia. I come from a part of Australia with beautiful white sand any clean beaches, therefore it is hard to enjoy anywhere that's not like that. The sand looks a dirty colour, and there can be a lot of rubbish on the beach. On the plus side, the water is a beautiful temperature and you can get some nice surfing waves (although it is definitely a beach that your have to swim between the flags)"
Selena39,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2015,"Nice beach for afternoon drinks or food. Definitely not the golden sands of our Australian beaches, but great for a refreshing dip with the added character of beach bars. The street hawkers are there but very polite and no hard sell. Beautiful sunsets."
linda l,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,Bean bags etc. are set up so you can watch the sunset. You can also buy drinks..you will be bombarded with people trying to sell you things
Tim W,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Not white sand like Nusa Dua but a good beach, not crowded, and with plenty of bars and cafes nearby"
Arlene Y,"Drayton Valley, Canada",Dec 2015,"Loved this beach. Beautiful white sand, and there were lots of people surfing. Could rent surf boards nearby. "
Ryw Surf Lesson B,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"We do Surf Lesson for beginners, Surfing Instructor will explan for instruction and help the beginner surfer to catch the wave and padle to stand up on the surf board and we will take photos of beginner surfer when they stand up and ride them waves on the surfboard.. Duration 1 hour and 2 hours."
FleecySqueezyFizzy,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"Perfect getaway from your busy work routine, I'm referring to Singaporean. Quiet, very calm and it helps to relief stress. "
Travelmore1261,Sunshine Coast Australia,Dec 2015,"Good clean beach with good surf on the doorstep of Seminyak. Tasty bars and cafe which supply beanbags if you buy a drink or food. Hawkers are good natured and no too aggressive ( just be polite, they're trying to make a living too) easy to hire surf or bogey boards and rips are ok. Clean water unlike Kuta. "
Ashley H,"Bideford, UK",Dec 2015,"Nice beach, lots of different bars and places to eat all the way along. Very good surf if that's your thing. Big waves a lot of the time. Can become pretty annoying getting pestered by the locals all the time. They are always trying to sell you stuff. Also if you want to lie on a sunbed you have to pay. But don't be afraid to haggle, there are so many people trying to get you on their sunbed so if they say a price that's too high then just go to the next man. Once you do have a sunbed then the guys running it are happy to bring you beers or whatever you want really. "
aview2akill,"Seattle, WA",Dec 2015,The beach in Seminyak is good and the water is very clean.  The water is not super blue and the sand is not white so don't expect Hawaii or Bermuda.  But fun safe beach with many cool places to grab a drink to watch the sunset from. 
Micheal E,"Cairo, Egypt",Dec 2015,"there is a lot of beach clubs you can go to. The beach is not so amazing to chill on the beach, you have a lot better options. its good for some surfers"
ong_giri,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"place to relax on the beach or just walk along the beach, or get wet in water  or take surfing lesson there"
Jane1808,"Whyalla, Australia",Nov 2015,a nice clean beach that stretched for miles! Surfing lessons were available and in the evening dining and entertainment was available.  sitting on bean bags listening to live music throughout the evening is very popular 
Taffoolie,"Paris, France",Dec 2015,"The beach is clean and so nice. You can walk for a long time, the beach is wide and long.water is beautiful and sunset is breathtaking here. "
Sean T,"Canberra, Australia",Dec 2015,"The beach itself is not great, there are better beaches to visit. Pretty overrated. The only saving grace is the number of clubs such as potato head. They are amazing."
Linsie C,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2015,Nice beach n beautiful view. Not many people and good for relax. Closed from my hotel just walk around 5 minutes. Love to came back  here next time with my family.
A2535ATjohnw,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Nice clean beach. Kids loved it. Plenty of vendors for food and drinks. Locals will try to sell you stuff, so be wary."
joliefolie,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2015,"Dip your feet in the creamiest golden sand as you watch tiny crabs immerse from the doughy, wet sand. Great area for beach lounging, sun tanning, people watching and walking."
Debbie L,"Dallas, Texas",Nov 2015,Definitely not what I expected especially from all the hype. Beach and sea water seemed rather dirty and it was too crowded with vendors.
Kirsttreth,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"So much happening here. Great waves, nice clean sand, surfing, horseback riding, kite flying, cool bars and eateries. "
RGH8800,"Seattle, WA",Dec 2015,"I was surprised that this beach was fairly clean. At first glance I thought OMG it looks like Patong Beach in Phuket Thailand, but boy was I wrong. The beach was fairly clean, but because the sand was not white at first the water seemed dirty but when you get in you can see your feet from 5 feet in the water. We enjoyed swimming in the cool refreshing water and getting drinks from the beach bars that litter the beach. "
Dyah K,3 contributions,Nov 2015,Go in low season the beach is not that packed..u can get beautiful sunset scenery..ur kids can play in clean sand and catch the wave..a lots of beach club around if u want to sit back and relax.or just bring your own beach blanket(if u want to pay 100.000idr u can rent a beach chair).
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great day to visit Seminyak Beach, hot , small swell, lifeguard and hawkers on point duty. Boogie boards and surfboards available for hire (not much rental income from these today)."
Sandra S,"Edge Hill, Australia",Nov 2015,There was a lot of rubish on the beach and I saw some small creeks which looked like they are carrying sewage.
Indra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"This place the second beach that i loved after Uluwatu beach area. If you are in the city i recommended this place to sit, relax and enjoy the sunset in this beach. All kind of activities that you can see around this area, also if you want to find good restaurants along the Seminyak street. Nice place to spend for the sunset time! "
Batchy94,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2015,"A very beautiful beach and especially beautiful at sunset, worth going down to watch the sunset a couple of people trying to sell things on the beach but that's Bali. Worth taking time to go have a look at !"
Dolores S,Mauritius,Nov 2015,"Not sure about the swimming here, the swell was pretty high but nice easy surfing. I walked all the way to Kuta Beach, great views of the bay and nobody to disturb you. Great for jogging as well!"
Vinaya S,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2015,All kinds of beach activities are available here and the scenery is awesome especially when the weather gets cloudy! We had a great time.
Chris K,"Beirut, Lebanon",Dec 2015,"Beautiful beach but very high waves for a swim unless your a surfer.Regarding the sunset, its phenomenal !!"
Adam J,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2015,Great wide beach for strolling swimming or tanning. Dark sand with rough waters. Lots of action and will be an up and coming beach in Bali in the years to come. Invest in it now before it grows!
kerrys474,Burton,Dec 2015,"Watching the sunset on beach bean bags with live music, drinking Bintang and cocktails with great company and great service. Perfect. Awesome atmosphere."
sjbrady_jb,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2015,This is a mustTo wander down onto the beach at seminyak grab a spot at any one of a number of different bars on the beach listen to music add a cold beer and some quality snacks and you are in business one of life's wonderful multi cultural experiencesRecommend as a rite of passage
chellemaree88,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,"Stay at your resort pool!This beach has dangerous currents and is filthy! Do yourself a favour, stay at your hotel pool! "
iainadamson,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Dec 2015,a beach is a beach is a beach   plenty of beds to hire   plenty of people selling hats drinks snacks  plenty of places to learn to surf  very good hotels in the area 
June H,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2015,Stayed at Double six with an ocean view which we never tire of.  From people watching in the morning to the brilliant sunsets at night it is just heaven.  We love it.  Also sunset drinks on the beach is an amazing experience.
saverioca,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"Semyniak beach is one of the most wonderful place for surfers and young people as well, nevertheless you could find some parts where Bali is still have the  old style feeling with part of the jungle mixed with alang alang roofs.Specially the part in front of Oberoi Hotel where the nature is really protagonist and elegant garden landscape make you happy to walk on the beach...amazing!"
guptadrravi,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2015,The beach is not as good as the other breaches in Bali.. seems a bit dirty although flooded with people.. the croud is great and there are quite a lot of clubs surrounding this area.. not a beach where one can take a dip.. more of a sight seeing place
Rimi22,"London, UK",Aug 2015,You get the best views of the sunset on this beach! Never have we seen such a beautiful sunset and sunrise! 
lalith1,"Panjim, India",Nov 2015,Can be reached on foot from seminyak square in 10 mins. Good for swimming as the water is not rough or choppy.Quite and good for viewing sunset
Bonny_Febrialdy,Jakarta,Nov 2015,"Nice place for family with calm waves, not many peoples around, not to hot due to many coconut trees and easy to access."
Paul,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"Although a little packed at dusk, there's some great eateries further north of W Resort where you can lie down and watch the sunset on a sun bed. Certainly less traversed than further south at the likes of Double Six and also less hawkers. Check it out for a sunset or 5."
pelpinda_nl,"Zevenhuizen, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,Very nice beach with a lot of restaurants. I found the quality of the restaurants at the beach very poor. But it is very nice to watch the sunset on a beanbag. 
Al2go,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,The beach was filthy but at least they don't hassle you.  rubbish and what looked like a sewage film with no evidence that anything is being done about it. Sadly litter generally in Indonesia doesn't seem to be an issue that is being addressed as everywhere I have been has the same problem. I know that we as tourists have a responsibility to do what we can and I hope that most of us do.  we don't think we will come back to Bali.
Scott M,16 contributions,Nov 2015,Been down a few times this recent trip to bali. (Both at night and day)Can be very pretty particularly at sunset.Bit of a shame how dirty and polluted it is.Plenty of eateries and stalls selling bintang.Will probably go back again.Certainly would NOT go swimming here however.
Kris W,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2015,"Relaxing day swimming in the beach and tanning on the sun chairs, lots of inexpensive beach cafes to have a nice lunch "
Matthew J,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,WOrth the sunset.. have some beers people! cheers! also do take a walk along the beach and enjoy the warm backwash of the sea.. CHeers! 
caty00197,"Tallinn, Estonia",Nov 2015,"The beach is nice, mostly waves are too big for swimming. On sunset the beach is very popular and most bar on the beach have chill atmosphere and live music."
lanie f,Philippines,Oct 2015,It’s peculiar to see offerings and some Hindu rituals happening on its long stretch where elegant resorts are present. While walking to look for cheap and good resto we even witnessed two live ducks being tossed into the sea along with some fruits for offering. The poor ducks got broken necks instantly because of the strong waves.
lenny s,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"i love the seminyak beach...the sands...the colourful places for us to sit and relax while watching the sunset...seeing people playing, surfing...wonderful"
Katwildo,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,"Delicious selections.  Quite busy.  Reasonable prices.  Squid ink calamari pasta yummy, but portion a little mean.  "
KAMERM,"London, UK",Nov 2015,"Not too much hassling by sellers. Beds can be bartered for, then you are left in peace. Lovely San and a good swell in the sea, good for bodyboarding, surfing, not that I would do either but others were."
Eddie W,3 contributions,Nov 2015,We went on off season so the beach was nearly empty except the crowds in the Potato Head Club.There were heaps of offerings on the beach so pay attention to them.The beach has weird smell so you might no want to jump in the water.
manonspot,larkhall,Nov 2015,"Seminyak beach unlike Other nearby beaches have beds for hire most of the way down the beach which you can hire by the hour,most people come down around lunch time where you can have a nice meal at the beach bars.After a drink or meal you can lie on beds until sun goes down by which time more people arrive to watch this lovely spectacle ,this is a truly amazing sight.After sun disappears (6-30-7-00pm November,) people retreat to the bean bags set up on the sand outside the bars.The staff set up a makeshift stage and a band starts playing on the beach,you just lay back and soak in the atmosphere,brilliant."
Carine P,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,"well, personally i prefer seminyak than kuta beach, less people, less tourists, less crowded. the water isn't clear blue like nusa lembong or gigi islands but still its a nice place to come, sit, relax and enjoy the day."
Dhruva34,"Noida, India",Oct 2015,This was the first time my son was on a beach since he turned one. He had an absolute blast playing with the sand (probably ate quite a bit) and i had a great time jogging along the beach. crowd was well behaved and the sunsets were gorgeous.
Carla M,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,"We visited Seminyak beach on a number of occasions over 12 days. We took our children who are 7, 5 and 3 years old respectively. Great place for familes. The surf can get rough but safe-to-swim areas are flagged. The surf is great for learning how to body surf which our older children did. A really friendly place, we met lots of other families by the beach and it was easy to strike up conversations. We had a sunset dinner one night. Yes, it was expensive but it was entirely worth it to watch the sunset, drink in hand, delicious food close by, lounging on a bean bag. Loved it and the so did the kids. The water is warm. The kids adored swimming until it was dark.  The sellers can be a bit full on. If you make eye-contact, watch out! Generally though once we said 'no thanks' we were left in peace. Bargain for the sun lounges. On our first day we paid 100,000 rupiah for one hour, by our last day we were getting the same lounge for 50,000 rupish for two hours!! "
JB0642015,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"A must-see if you are in Bali. The restaurants along this beach are cheap and delicious, incredibly talented singers woo you as the sun goes down. Sipping on cocktails under brightly coloured umbrellas and fairy-lights is just perfect! "
EdmundEmmanuel,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2015,"Average beach; don't expect white sandy blue beach... Limited activities, only surfing, not allowed to swim there due to the waves... Walking a distance and you can see sewer-like water flowing towards the beach from the resorts. EWWW... On a side note, definitely nice for a sunrise/sunset stroll, but that's just about it."
chirag g,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2015,if you want you can avoid seminyak beack as its not that great. south bali beaches are better and if you wanna party then pls goto kuta..
Glenndavid62,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Nov 2015,"This beach is clean, surfers seem to like this area. Food and surfing lessons are available. At sunset it is the place to go, sit on the beanbags, listen to music, have a cocktail and watch the sunset."
Pierre D,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,"Our third  (and last) week at Seminyak Beach.Concluding: the beach is wonderful; but the (beach)restaurants here serve abstemious/average food; and certainly not cheap!But: you're on the beach: the sound of the waves, and so on.....that compensates a lot, you expect (and hope).But no: each beachrestaurant has its own stage with a very loud band playing. And of course you can discuss about music taste; but you cannot discuss about the volume of the music: you can hardly talk when they are playing   Every restaurant feels the urge to leave (like a dog) a smellflag.Our conclusion: spend your day at Seminyak Beach and for dinner: find a restaurant near Seminyak Square: several restaurants serve very good food (find them at TripAdvisor!!!). The price is often more than right and the music never dominates the atmosphere"
Romit N,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,Spent half a day lazing around the beach with the occasional dip in the water. Peaceful atmosphere and saw several local smiles. Would highly recommend coming here.
jatinjain155,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2015,This was the best among all the beaches I have seen in Bali. One of the most beautiful places to be at sunset. Highly recommend to visit at sunrise or sunset. Many clubs and restaurants along the beach. Most of the people leave the beach after sunset. Went there at 8 at night and saw the beach empty.
Catherine A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"large, spread out beaches makes it great for sunbathing (if not interrupted by the locals)..it is a glistening beach with darkish sand and not so crystal clear water. The waves roll and roll and it is pretty dangerous for new swimmers. Everything is ridiculously over priced and can be bargained down to 90%.There are lots of families with young kids and cute dogs running around on leashes which makes it a nice, friendly beach."
Argenine,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2015,Though the beach gets slightly more crowded at sunset the water is shallow and you can just walk right in and swim for quite a distance. It is better than the kuta beach as there are less surfers and this beach is more about swimming and relaxing. 
Davey Y,Tokyo,Aug 2015,"I was shocked there were so few people on this stretch of beach! Everyone seemed to crowd down around Kuta, but up in Seminyak we had so much room to ourselves."
carolbali,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2015,This area has got terrific atmosphere even at early morning.The locals are so friendly and they dont push for you to buy.Not like Kuta beach.The bars along the beach offer great value for money.Food and drink are all great value Always good for a laugh!
lostdipika,Wisconsin,Aug 2015,"Better one. Better than Kuta and Legian. Seminyak is the house to many luxury and top end hotels and restaurants, I heard people swear by the night life. We found the beach bit cleaner than the other 2 Kuta and Liegian and this was one fantastic part around. Loved the roadside pubs and bars on the other side, surely a tourists paradise."
Vishu_Agarwal,India,Nov 2015,Went in morning. Beach has great waves and look really beautiful and calm. Doesnt have many shops and things to do but if you are looking for peaceful time on beach Seminyak can be one of them. 
Ling30,KL,Nov 2015,"Nice beach beach, with flag indicators from the many beach front hotel for surfing. Typical powerful wave good for surfing, not for swimmers. Facing west, thus can see nice sunsets in the evening, and on the other side, it is decorated with all lightings from beach restaurants. Many locals selling goods or surfing lesson etc, very much overpriced, and can usually reduced by half when you walk away. So the price requested is not tally with product or quality. There are some section of the beach which are public, others are sorted with bean bags and sun bed for rent belong to some operators, you just need to pick any one you like, and they will approach with price.Many restaurants, colorfully decorated along the beach road, only very few bicycle riders, and the rental is much more expensive than Sanur beach. Sanur beach is equally nice, and much more quite. Seller there also quotes more sensible price for goods."
Aisha214,New York,Sep 2015,"This beach remains too crowded, and is a dirty one compared to other beaches in Bali. Hence it is good only to view the lovely view of the sunset.There are a lot of people playing volleyball on the beach, some budding sand artists, lots of hawkers and a number of options to eat and drink. This place is good for water sports."
Evan B,"Diamond Creek, Australia",Nov 2015,You must go and watch the sunsets. If on a budget sit on the plastic chairs v the beanbags and umbrellas
Jan s,"Traralgon, Australia",Nov 2015,"We hired two over-priced sunbeds and proceeded to play in the waves with the kids. Once the hawkers walking our piece of beach had tried a couple of times, and been rebuffed, we could actually settle in, relax and enjoy ourselves. Lots of cigarette butts on the beach but otherwise it seemed fairly clean and it made a nice change from our hotel pool."
Gary K,"Toowoomba, Australia",Aug 2015,The beach itself was ok at the waters edge. There were some dirty drains and small creeks flowing onto the Beach at various points carrying rubbish with them which takes away from the experience. It was nice to be able to sit at a bar or restaurant along the back of the beach and enjoy a cold drink or meal at sunset. 
Jellymaren,"Leiden, The Netherlands",Nov 2015,"I've been told Seminyak is way more quiet than Kuta. The beach has got another vibe, with a lot of colorful beach bars, but it's still quite busy. Prices are the same as in Kuta. Lovely place to hang out and watch the sunset, solo or with whoever you want 🙏."
sash0131,Massachusetts,Oct 2015,"Very next to the 'W' and many other hotels (including Legian Bali) along its length.  We enjoyed the pleasant walk along the beach.  If you find a hotel along this beach, the sunsets will be enjoyable and likely to be visible from your ocean view room itself - but on the beach it will be much more fun..."
Adsandme,31 contributions,Nov 2015,Better and quitter beach to chill at.. Sun beds over priced!!! Sand very hot so be careful and wear decent footwear!! Be prepared to get hassled a lot!! 
Greg C,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,"Not a bad beach, not bad surf, but there are loads of beaches in the world like that. Nice sunsets, but hawkers abound! Do not buy anything here - VERY overpriced, no matter what you haggle down to. Go to Ubud or beyond for that. Nice place to get some food or a drink, but is priced accordingly."
Marcel dB,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"Stayed on the beach to enjoy the sunset with some juice and simple snacks. Juice was rich in taste, not too sweet. The 3 bnacks a little boring. The view was beautiful and I think that is what you pay for."
Pete_fm_Oz,"Darwin, Australia",Nov 2015,An afternoon in Bali is not complete without a relaxing drink on the beach.Seminyak beach has a number of warungs Resto and bars along the beach between double six and Jl Arjuna. Be prepared to be assaulted by the beach vendors plying there wares. But they are respectful if you just say no. so be it a Bintang or a cocktail the sunset is best viewed from a comfy beanbag chair on the sand above the high water markEnjoy !!
Pliszek,"Warsaw, Poland",Nov 2015,"As stated above, this is the longest and widest beach I've been to - but what I've mostly liked is the myriad of restaurants and bars along the Seminyak-Legian section of the beach - some to recommend, such as Champlung, with great after-sunset live music :-)"
Ayshe I,"Muscat, Oman",Oct 2015,"This is a beautiful beach, which is kept clean and not too crowded. Watching the sunset from the beach was beautiful, and the restaurants along the beach front set-up lounging areas and some even have live music so you can enjoy the beach in the evenings. "
GGIO10,"Chicago, IL",Oct 2015,"Nice beach, but you can't go more than 1 minutes without someone trying to sell you something and sell you hard on it. They basically harass you non stop. "
Qball_351,"Pearcedale, Australia",Nov 2015,We spent a few days here in our travels. With everything from amazing eateries fun water sports and beautiful sunsets this is a must see and play please while in Bali 
BeachObsessed73,"Calgary, Canada",Oct 2015,I spent an afternoon at Seminyak Beach body surfing and it was so much fun.  The waves are big but it didn't feel dangerous.  No undertow.  There were a few surfers in the evening but they mainly came out the next morning.  Very nice long beach for walking.  Great spot to watch the sunset.
travellove91,"London, UK",Oct 2015,"Lovely beach with beautiful sand and lovely clear waters. I visited this beach in October 2015 and every day was sunny with lots of people around-not too busy however! Beach loungers are not too expensive we paid 100,000 rupiahs for 2 beds. There are a few sales people selling various knick-knacks but not as much hassle as some other places I have been to. This is a long stretch of beach that connects to Kuta beach. Would definitely recommend this beach if youre staying in seminyak!"
beysie,"Barcelona, Spain",Sep 2015,"Although the beach has some treasures as ""La Plancha"" beachclub to go at sunset, the beach isn't really nice for sunbathing. It was dirty and noisy. Not nice as may be beaches at the peninsula. "
Sandy T,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,"Go early to beat the heat, but extremely pleasant. Worthwhile and great for working out your bearings. "
JamesHAfrica,"Arusha, Tanzania",Oct 2015,"Best enjoyed early morning and late evening, with friends and a cocktail in hand, an Asian margarita for example. "
Stefan R,"Munich, Germany",Oct 2015,"Its really nice to relax in one of the many bars there and watch the beautiful sundown. Many of them habe beanbags in the sand. Best time is from 90 Minutes before official sundown. Only downturn are the sellers that constantly ask you if you want to buy something like wtches, sunglasses, art and many more."
vishwajitgaikwad,"Hyderabad, India",Feb 2015,"Depending on the time of your visit, this place offers varying experiences. It is very clean most of the months but during the winter months, the tide brings back all the plastic waste on the beach. A good place to laze around, get a cheap but wonderful foot massage and get entertained by numerous hawkers around"
Jom B,23 contributions,Oct 2015,"One of the best sunset in bali another kuta beach, near by seminyak central, petitenget temple, and alot people come to see the beautiful sunset and white sand"
Beth V,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2015,"The water was clear, the beach and sand was clean. However, having been spoiled by West Australian and Queensland beaches, it was hard to rate this in the same category. However, there were lots of beachgoers making the most of the beach and thoroughly enjoying themselves"
HpBrenn,"Trinity Beach, Australia",Oct 2015,"Seminyak beach has less hustle and bushel then Kuta. Same black volcanic sand but a bit more rubbish as there are not so many Hotel, so less cleaning done. Dirty creeks run straight in to the sea, so i did not bother to have a swim. It's good for a cheap sun set, if you don't mind no bands playing and you bring your own drinks. "
Joe H,"Jerrabomberra, Australia",Oct 2015,Very very pretty at sunset and at night but during day just not that greatRubbish on beach which was disappointing Rips like nobody's business and tonnes of idiots swimming in there !Constant hagglers too who were pretty damn persistentStick to pool until 4 pm!
Miranda B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,The beach up this end is much nicer that the Kuta/Legian end it seems to be cleaner around the nice resorts.   
beaulife,Ubud,Oct 2015,"I am living withing walking distance to this pure beauty. Sunset at any given day is always a fun-filling one, either for sunset run, power walk, or lazily siting with a drink."
JML,2 contributions,Oct 2015,We came here and found a great little Bar called La Plancha. Could have stayed here for hours!! Amazing beach and such great atmosphere. 
Espressogal,"Orange, Australia",Oct 2015,"Dead flat, mid sized waves, super sunsets and a choice of reclining lounges or bean bags. It's difficult for an Australian to review a beach and go wow! Definitely not the reason your would come to Bali."
Jan A T,"Hawley, PA",Oct 2015,"A beautiful beach for a sunset walk before dinner at one of the nearby restaurants, like La Lucciola! Not crowded in the evenings, easy access, easy parking, stunning views."
Karyadi S,"Denpasar, Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Nice beach for learning surving and gòod for take the family walking to the beach..also many good beach reataurant sorrounding
Nicholas B,pennyroyal,Oct 2015,Such a shame but the increase in rubbish and nearby creeks that are best described as open drains are a blight on what was once a delight
Judy W,"Greater Manchester, UK",Oct 2015,"The beach is not as nice as I originally thought, though it is clean enough and quiet. Sadly, it covers with lots of volcanic sand which has made it less attractive. "
Kim S,19 contributions,Oct 2015,We walked along the beach after breakfast there were other couples happily walking along which was lovely to see. I loved the sea mist but the sand was so hot with no shoes eek! Awesome waves go check it out.
Sheila J,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2015,The people are welcoming and wonderful and the beaches are absolutely gorgeous.. I rented a private villa within walking distance and was nice taking in the sites on our walk to the beach.. 
janicemareegreen2604,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,The beach was fantastic and watching the sunrise along the beach was beatutiful. Many people fly kites on the beach to and there is easy access through many of the well known restaurants like the potato head restaurant.
seemo_x,"Yanbu, Saudi Arabia",May 2015,"if you like the clean and wonderful sunshine you must come to seminyak beach, t's less crowded than kuta beach, there are many restaurants there. and this place has a lot tourists."
Stew147,"Winchester, UK",Nov 2014,Such a great place to chill. Nice bars and restaurants around to eat. Plenty of loungers to have a nice beer too. The best sunsets you could possibly see
Scott S,"Gawler, Australia",Oct 2015,Beatiful swimming beach fantastic for sunsets. We loved the cheap beach warongs that served basic cheap eats and cheap beer. You can hire a beach chair for $5 all day and they bring out the bean bags after sunset. Much cleaner than Kuta Beach.
Micky M,Singapore,Oct 2015,We watched the sunset from the beach and it was beautiful. The fine soft sand just makes you so wanna play with it. 
vivianmibi,"New York City, New York",Oct 2015,"Though low season, it was a large beach, quiet, perfect for just relaxing under the sun! There are a few restaurants nearby and you can rent a beach chair for a pretty good price if needed. The sand here - amazing. "
geelongexpat,"Chatan-cho, Japan",Oct 2015,"I cruised down here to watch the sunset the last 2 nights. There is plenty of room for everyone. The surfers, the swimmers, the tanners, the drinkers and even the dogs. The beach itself has more of a brown sand, but it is not rocky and very flat. You'll be surprised at how close some of the waves get to you. There are a couple of very trendy bars here as well to sip cocktails in. Definitely worth a visit."
globetrotting4life,london,Oct 2015,"Beautiful, white-sand beach, clean, with great atmosphere especially at night with good restaurants and live music. Very romantic especially at night."
Laurence777_12,Wellington,Oct 2015,"Thoroughly recommend a lazy afternoon and evening whiling away the time slouched on a beanbag at one of Seminyak beach bars. Any will do, they're all the same pretty much - just choose the one with tunes you can tolerate and plonk yourself down.  The service is efficient and friendly, the food comforting and delicious, and the Bintang washes it down smoothly. What more could you ask? Oh, and then there's those sunsets...magic."
Liam S,"Geelong, Australia",Oct 2015,We went to Seminyak beach a few times during our stay in Seminyak. It is a nice beach for sunsets. When it gets dark the atmosphere on the beach is great. Only downside is the waves are extremely strong. 
shashamurai,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Walking distance frm Seminyak Square. But we unsure of the exact shortcuts to the beach. So we had our long way walk till we found Ku De Ta restaurant, But we didnt enter from here as there is security check to enter the restaurant. So we just walk ahead and found ourself nearly at the end before reaching to 'Legian Bali' . So we guessed that we have made the wrong moves by not always asking for direction. Choices of turn right or left facing beach . We decided to turn left and walk few miles before reaching seminyak beach (this time round, we made e right choice.) Seminyak beach , full of tourist and lots of restaurant, noisy but really njoyed, surfers, eyecathing on horse riding pass u and there will be people approaching to u that can make hair braiding. Nicely doNe!! We end our day there by ordering cocktail and walk back to Ku De Ta restaurant and ask the security if we can exit here. He smile and say yes.. "
JadeEPreCious,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Beach is small, a bit dirty and with super hot sands. Nevertheless, the beach is pretty with great seaview."
Daphne T,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,"love this part of the beach in Bali has so much to offer in the way of café/bars music all day and people watching a great place to spend the day swimming, surfing or just hanging out"
Satrajit R,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Pretty sad & boring beach. Went for sunrise but looks of the beach was disappointing. Taking a bath is also not allowed.
rsandsT1,"Camrose, Canada",Sep 2015,"Seminyak Beach has it all sun, surf, sand, people, restaurants for every taste, live entertainment and if that has not fulfilled your day sit back at the end of it and enjoy the beautiful sunset."
Lyn O,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,"Great overnight stay. Very clean rooms, comfy bed. Great variety for breakfast. Pool was very clean as well"
Princezna A,"Roztoky, Czech Republic",Oct 2015,"Beaches are full of people which is good, but people make more and more mess and nobody cleans it. The garbage bin are only anywhere. So instead of  beautiful view you can see just plastic garbage on the beach. What is the worst,  no one can see it."
Greg P,"Victoria Park, Australia",Oct 2015,"Beautiful sunset and view. an easy stroll from the Dusun Villa, approx 500m leisurely walk. Then stop at Mexicolla for a quick drink and eat"
Ristiyatikho A,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"I back here again and again.  Enjoying the sunburn at 9 am till 5 pm.  Take lunch here, many cafe around.  Then waiting the sunset.  The cafe start preparation, put table and chair for visitors at the beach.  Enjoying long island and beer before dinner, meanwhile the sun start hiding, flashing the tinge blushing the sky"
Louinsydney,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,Nice large beach.. it was clean in front of our hotel but not so much further along the beach. Nice spot to go for a run before it gets too hot.
ScambusterSZ,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,Definitely go to the beach for Sunset Drinks. The few 'Bean Bag' Beach clubs are great and the food is surprisingly good (go 'right' along from The Cocoon resort) . The sunset is amazing and the new Railler Bintang will please most people (new Lemon flavoured beer = Shandy in a bottle)
SriDevi2103,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"Loved this beach, lovely sunset and amazing beach bars! Clean beach. Watched one of the most amazing sunsets here!"
Andrew T,31 contributions,Oct 2015,"The sunset is very nice, but by Australian standards the beach sucks.Lots of cigarette butts to dodge and human sewage running off the hotels into the ocean."
Steve R,4 contributions,Oct 2015,Loved the beach - rented beach chairs from the locals.  who were very attentive.  Always there to bring you beers or coconut drinks
MatthewTheCatthew,"Fukuyama, Japan",Oct 2015,"There's just no other sunset like it on earth. The huge red perfectly circular orb, slowly descending into the endless horizon is romantic, breathtaking and truly spectacular. The beach offers plenty of beanbag restaurants to kick back, sip a Bintang and take in this truly awe inspiring spectacle with the ones you love. The redness of the dying light is otherworldly, ethereal and awakens light in even the hardest of hearts."
Leontko,Singapore,Oct 2015,"Right beside it's sister beach at legain, Seminyak is the less crowded of the two. However, they are both pretty similar in terms of what they have to offer. Surf and drink vendors line the beach offering surf lessons and board rental. Salesmen of sunglasses and henna artists will also offer their wares and services to you. If you love to surf, the place here is pretty great. However, be warned that they can be quite strong for a beginner surfer, so don't go too far out! In fact, if you are a beginner, it might be better to surf at Legain. Also, there are more surfers in Legain so it would be easier for anyone to spot you if you're in trouble. *In fact I had to be saved by a lifeguard after getting swept out by a riptide!"
Leonie B,Tecoma,Sep 2015,Beautiful place to sit back relax and watch the sun set. Shopping is good and you don't have to indulge if you don't want to. Have a drink and take it all in.
Christina89137,"London, UK",Sep 2015,"We loved the beach, there are chairs & umbrellas for hire. A few food places locally for all budgets. Lots of locals selling anything from bracelets to watches, sunglasses, painting etc. the waves are amazing, but quite fierce at times so not great for kids, unless they don't go very far in the water. Fair few surfers enjoying the waves when we were there. "
Brooke M,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"Nice clean sand, great waves but not too dangerous. Huge beach with clean waters and good atmosphere."
Shantanu Jalgaonkar,"Pune, India",Oct 2015,Amazing beach with good basic facility and nice views. Amazing sun set. A good place for night life and family holidays
Yoshi Y,"Tokyo Prefecture, Japan",Sep 2015,"I think Kuta is the best one but for me Seminyak beach is great one for Sunset, the wave not as big as in Kuta but it great for beginner surfing. I did surfing but i can""t do it. I ill come here again!"
pingaroo,"Chicago, IL",Sep 2015,"We read that beaches in Bali are nothing to rave about so didn't have a high expectation. Actually Seminyak beach as well the adjoining beaches exceeded our expectations. We stayed at the Oberoi, which is located on Seminyak beach. Everyday, we walked either north towards the W hotel or south towards the airport for 2-3 hours. For the most part, the beach has fine white sand and is clean and empty. There are quite a few ""natural"" waterways draining into the ocean on the beach. Our hotel claims it's from the rice fields, but these waterways smelled awfully like sewer. In between the luxury hotels, there would be the odd house with a garbage dump right on the beach. The southern end of the beach is a bit rowdy and touristy but has better sand. If you go in the morning before the partiers wake up, then it's serene and romantic. Sunsets are gorgeous! "
Tania M,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Sep 2015,"We visited this beach a number of times during our stay in Bali. During the day the beach is covered with lounge chairs and umbrellas to hire (we were quoted $20 for an hour) as well as people selling just about everything. In the evening, the lounges are mostly away, the bars open up and the people flock to see the sunset. The beach is wide and the water is cool and refreshing. It is relatively clean and there is plenty of space for everyone."
CelloOnWheels,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2015,We walked for a very long time but definitely worth it and so many bars along the way to pop into. Unbeatable sunset viewing!
Little_Ewi_travel,"Manchester, UK",Sep 2015,"It's the Australians version of the Brits spain. HOWEVER,  the beach is all but spotless. They charge sooo much (for Asia) for beds but they're some of the comfiest beds we've had in a year of beaches in Asia. By the end of the day the sea ia so far out and the waves were so big we gave up but that's because were lazy.Looked great for surfing. "
Chris T,132 contributions,Oct 2015,"A lovely clean beach to swim, surf, relax on or just look at. Not as protected as Sanur but much cleaner and prettier than Kuta"
TrevorDoornbos,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2015,"Ok, so you will have to pay somewhere between AUD$15-25 for 2 sun lounges on the beach for 1/2 to a whole day, about AUD$10 for a good sarong, massage, kites, sunglasses etc, and yes you will get hassled by the local entrepreneurs to buy from them.This is their island.  This is how they make money to live, pay the bills and put food on the table.Have fun. Be friendly, and make an attempt to speak at lest 2-3 words in their language.If you are rude and disrespectful, the you deserve the same in response.We had a great 5 days in Seminyak by following a few simple rules.Don't ask the price unless you intend to buy.Don't ask to see unless you intend to buy.Be realistic in your haggling.This is modern day Bali where everyone has a motor scooter and needs to pay high rents to live close enough to the tourist area to work.These humans that work the beach have families to support and are absolutely flabbergasted when rich tourists who spend $000's to come to Bali then get upset at paying $20 for 2 lounges for 4-5 hours on one of the best spots on the planet. So!Be polite and smile.Learn a little Bahasa (That's Indonesian - Language on business in Bali).Selamat - Pagi, Siang, Sore (Morning, Afternoon 11-2, Afternoon 2-5)Tidak Terama Kasih - No thank youTerama Kasih - Thank youSatu/Dua/Tiga Jam - One/two/three hoursMahal - ExpensiveDiskoun - Discount pleaseWe came back after 5 years and Kathy still sells Sarongs and does a great back, neck, foot massage, and of course hair braiding.Billy The Kid and Charlie Brown sell watches and sunglasses.Denny does an amazing Henna Tattoo - Both my girls got them And all of this right in font of Ku De Ta, so you can walk up and use the foot/body showers to rinse off the sand/salt in between swims, and of course to head up and grab a delicious snack/lunch. We had lunch there two days and it was fantastic!Salt and pepper calamaris was great. Great curries and sate. Steak and chips, steak sandwiches etc.And of course a bar.Definitely worth a visit and to come back to."
meltravelled,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,"Seminyak beach is one of my preferred beaches in along Kuta. A little quieter, cleaner and you can get some amazing sunsets."
Benoit M,"Paris, France",Aug 2015,A Beach with a lot of people that want to show off... We appreciated much more the calm beaches of Lombok or Amed
Gabi Stenzel,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,This Beach is nice but you will find much better ones in Bali like in Padang Bai. Good is that you will find shops and restaurants around.
JessicaWorldTraveler,"Los Angeles, CA",Dec 2014,"Seminyak (while not a beautiful beach as it is full of trash) is a great area in Bali where many of the young people go. Full of restaurants, shops and clubs, it is buzzing with energy. "
Nomadic Boys Gay Travel Blog,"London, UK",Sep 2015,It's a good beach if you don't want to go in it - good for sunset and people watching. But it's a strong current so pointless for swimming - good for surfers.
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,Nice beach but crowded. Not very good place to go if it is peak season. Good to sit down in evening to watch sunset.
Deadgeckoo,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"Personally I thing if you're in the area and not planning to spend the day at one of the oh so trendy beach clubs dotted around you're better off at Double Six.  The beach is often too wavy for swimming and depending on the time of day it can be quite dirty.  If you're nearby it's not a bad way to spend the day, but I certainly wouldn't make an effort."
Rachel L,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,"Not my favourite beach. As it's a public beach, I felt that it was not well maintained. Obviously there's trash everywhere, and because they allow dogs to loiter, watch where you step! You may end up stepping on dog poo - which would be unpleasant. Also there are warungs set up near the entrance to the beach, but no proper trash disposal, so quite smelly unfortunately. Unsightly. "
Dipi7,29 contributions,Sep 2015,Best beach to have in the morning and evening. You can go around 5.30pm and wait the sunset. Sunset is amazing.Many good cafe.
S4853PFjennyc,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Lovely clean beaches with a great selection of food choices and bars along the beach strip. Our favourite restaurant for lunch was Champlung for nice relaxing lunch with great variety of food and very cold bintangs. Staff friendly and provide quick service
AweDi,24 contributions,Sep 2015,"The Seminyak beach is long and wide, you can walk, walk and walk or stay wherever you want and watch people. Sunsets are so beautiful! Sea is not too quiet but you can still enjoy it. Beach is clean (city workers continuously clean it)."
Nusye,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Like others beach in Bali.. Like Kuta, and Legian.. this beach one of best beach to enjoy Sunset in Bali. Worth to Go.. You can walk from Kuta Beach, Legian Beach, Double Six, then Seminyak Beach"
Peter G,"Brighton, UK",Aug 2015,"Spent many days and nights on Sminyak beach. The beach is huge and when we went in August it was busy enough but not packed. Plenty of bars/restuarants and many sun loungers to lie on, laid on the sand one day but even a light breeze will cover you and you stuff in sand. We generally paid 200K rupiah for two beds, sometimes more, sometimes less. The waves can get quite big so I think it's best to excercise caution, the pull of the sea is incredibly strong and if you're not a strong swimmer (or drunk) you could get into trouble quite quickly. The water was pretty clear.. It's one of the cleaner beaches we visited on the island. Quite a lot of people trying to sell you bracelets, paintings or massages but a smile and a no thank you and they'll leave you alone. Don't let that put you off coming here. At susnset you can sit on beanbags at the numerous restaurants and watch the sun go down while acoustic musicians play/sing. Too many playing Hotel California though! But very chilled way to spend an evening."
putueka,"North Kuta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,The beach is nice for lay down but not really good for swimming because wave is big and water not so clear. Better you go to balangan or pandawa beach in South bali 
Mark-1411,"Lichfield, UK",Sep 2015,Had a wonderful leisurely walk along the beach. Lovely setting. Will definitely return at sometime in the future. 
Richy27,"Puteaux, France",Aug 2015,"Very nice beach, especially for body board and surf. Restaurant and small shops on the beach. At 5 pm just drink a bintang and relax for the sunset show every day !"
Scott C,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Oct 2014,"Massive tidal movement here so a very very wide beach. The beach itself is OK but wouldn't rush there for a swim. Legian itself is a crazy place after 3pm when the traffic hits town and the Muslims that live here are all trying to get to prayer time.Other than that go a bit further south for a swim at Tuban. It's on the other sie of Kuta. Quieter, don't need to pay for a sun lounge, just drop your towel and in you go. The water is deeper and so cooler as well. Good friendly people down her."
William M,"Brosna, Ireland",Sep 2015,Relatively clean bearing in mind the numbers using it. Sun beds cheap enough €6 per person a day. Beach side bars. Plenty of surfers and surfing equipment and training . Normal problem with people selling but they go if you say 'NO'.  Sunset is beautiful. A tourist beach but worth a visit
Sue M,"Cairns, Australia",Sep 2015,We just love the vibe of Seminyak beach. Love the beach bars and the waves. The whole beach comes alive in the evening and is just beautiful.
Sharon B,"Central Mangrove, Australia",Sep 2015,Relaxing on the beach cold Bentag  the music live great atmosphere great food just beautiful large been bags great place to catch and relax
Eva T,"San Diego, CA",Sep 2015,"Nice beach with rough waves...at least when I was there. Had purchased the local beer, Bintang and fresh coconut juice at the local eatery stand on the beach which were refreshing!"
bj582015,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,excellent beach cafes but the venders on the beach can be frustrating as the interrupt conversation to try to sell cheap goods .. I felt sorry for them but didn't want their items
Kim P,18 contributions,Sep 2015,"Must be one of the most beatyful beaches i have seen (no sharks) big waves, perfekt for surfing. Only minus is the sales people constantly saying ""want to buy"". "
Osipova Kистина,"St. Petersburg, Russia",Sep 2015,Wide and big beach! a lot of surfing schools and rentals! You can rent sunbeds for 100 000 IDR per 2 person.
Paul T,"Bundaberg, Australia",Oct 2014,"My wife & I spent many hours on this beach drinking and relaxing on the sun beds at Willys Bar. Willy is a great guy, very friendly and accomodating, my wife does'nt like the taste of Bintang so we asked Willy if he would get us some Heiniken in for the following days, we paid him up front for what we thought we would drink and for the next few days we had ice cold Heinikens on call. The boys will also deliver your lunch! Nasi Goreng or Mi  Goreng for about $2.50 Au. Great beach good bunch of locals. We visited Oct 2014 and again this year Sept 2015."
Mysen90,"Sandnes, Norway",Sep 2015,I abselutely  LOVE seminyak and the beach is included. Stay at La Plancha for a nice sunset view with small appetisers and drinks.
Trevor S,"Oakleigh, Australia",Sep 2015,Day and night Seminyak beach has good beginners surf. Lots of rental places. Cold drinks beach chairs and sunsets are beautiful.  Then live music every night outside anyone of the cafes sitting in a bean bag.
Jimcheng222,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,This part of the Bali beach i would say is the 'higher end' side of the beach. Not sure if the sand is better; maybe the same.  BUT the nice and more expensive restaurants are in Seminyak beach.  In any case it's a really long long stretch so even from Kuta you can walk to Seminyak
Flowdream,"Cardiff-by-the-Sea, CA",Oct 2014,This beach has lots of hotels along it that are great to stay in. At night there are places to go along the beach but the day finds it full of tourists. It is a long beach and so is good for a long walk but very hot in the day.
Peditschon,Indonesia,Sep 2015,Good beach for you to have a surf lesson. Some local guide can teach you how to surf. The wave is not very big but quiet good for surfing. The beach also very nice for you to relax and sun bathing while you enjoy a bottle of beer.
Kitten84,Aberdeen,Jul 2015,"Miles of white sand, choppy sea and blue skies! Pineapple as you walk along the beach washed down with a 35 bingtang. Heaven on earth "
sylviecha2015,"Paris, France",Sep 2015,Difficult to swin and dangerous but lively with surfers.I tried to stay there for a while but too many preach sellers and you can't read more than 5 miinutes.Nice for long walks.
ThomvRijckevorsel,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2015,Me and my friends were staying in Seminyak for a few days and we went to the beach quite a lot. The nice thing about Seminyak beach is that it's less crowded than Kuta beach. There's a lot of nice little bars and restaurants where you can lounge around in a bean bag or have a nice lunch with an ocean view. It has the perfect mix of laid-back and luxurious. 
deboruccis2015,"Cowes, Australia",Sep 2015,Couldn't believe all the high rise . Tourists with NO idea of the rips Fortunately can still get the best Bakso on the beach at Jalan Butinelg near Seminyak/ kerokaban 
Sufyan87,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,"Nice beach to visit, waters were cool, dark sand though. Waves were pretty strong, ideal for body-boarding. "
lightcatcher77,"Munich, Germany",Sep 2015,"Kuta Beach is just 5 min by car away but it's worth.For hidden dream beaches you're at the wrong place , but for cheap drinks or coconuts you will get good offers."
Candz33,"Plettenberg Bay, South Africa",Aug 2015,"If you enjoy taking long strolls on beautiful beaches, then Seminyak beach is a must! Lovely white sands, beautiful hotels to look at and many restaurants to choose from when you need a rest."
AWorldView,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2015,"Seminyak beach is great for spending the day in the sun on beautiful long stretch of beach with people around who wanna spend time lazing on the beach,eat drink at local restaurants with rows and rows of comfy beach sun beds with umbrellas that are available for whole day from morn to eve at resonable rates..just take one of these and you are all set to relax and enjoy the beautiful beach"
mvavalis,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2015,This is a very nice beach if you don't want to travel far from the central area. The sand is not white but the beach itself is really nice as it is very long and lots of little bars along it with bean bags and music. Nice waves to learn how to surf. Clean. And later on at night there is live music and you can see the sunset.
Karthik A,19 contributions,Sep 2015,Unlike kuta... Seminyak beach is open till late. Theres soo many bars who offer very Decent prices... 
Carolina N,"Malolo Island, Fiji",Aug 2015,"Seminyak beach has 'black' sand and average water clarity. During the day it's all about relaxing, having a coupe of beers and reading a book. If you want a chair and some shade you have to pay around $10-20 per couple. I would recommend heading there in the evening to watch the sunset, have a cocktail and listen to some live acoustic music at one of the many restaurants which supply bean bags and cute colourful shades."
justine,"Zhongshan District, Taipei",Sep 2015,Seminyak beach is quiet and serene considering how central and busy it's located. I love coming here. The sunset is just beautiful. 
CSdreams803,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"It is a beautiful white sand beach in Seminyak.  It was fantastic to run on the beach, and you could enjoy a lovely view to sunset on the beach.  My boyfriend and I were staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort and we loved this beach.  "
Clover90vt,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Oct 2014,"The color of the sea water and the sand is not as what I imagined. The water is not blue, the sand is dark, rough and not white. But I do appreciate the beauty of the Mother Nature there. Strong waves are perfect for surfing. The beach is clean, food is great, though a little expensive - but still worth it! (I stayed there 3 nights and all restaurants in the area turned out amazing). I just wish they have more seafood restaurants that would sell more of lobsters, mantis, crabs... I couldnt find one though, most of the restaurants serve little prawns, sea bass, scallop, some other kinds of fish only. Maybe I would search for more next time. "
Roger S,Gold Coast Australia,Jul 2015,"We stayed at the Pelangi which opens out to the beach. We walked and swam every morning. It is a fun place with surf schools, good surf, kites, restaurants and coffee shops. Lots of people playing on the beach, lounge chairs for hire. At night warungs with cheap food and drink, bean bags and entertainment. Everything a beach should be. "
Kelgret,14 contributions,Aug 2015,Great beach to sit back relax and watch the day go by.......and the people of course! Only thing is I much prefer an Aussie beach as I would not trust the water or what could be floating in it. Large waves and strong undercurrents. Great place to watch the sun go down though with a beer in hand!
Peder D,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2014,Nice beach but beware as it is also a bit of a foodie tourist trap. Many of the beach sea food restaurants are ushering in customers well above their serving capacity resulting in extreme waiting times. Also check your selected fish isnt stuffed with ice when it goes on the scale for weighing. When you have picked your good restaurant you are almost guaranteed a splendid sunset view
lamasgergo,"Budapest, Hungary",Aug 2015,"Choose a bar next to the beach get a beer and enjoy the sunset. Most of places has live music or dj, so the atmosphere of this place at sunset is incredible. You have to see and feel it."
matteomath,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"One beach line from Kuta, but the location is more premium and high class. You need to prepare more money here to enjoy the view."
Philippa G,4 contributions,Aug 2015,"The sand was black, and swimming was prohibited often due to large waves and rips. The beach was nice to take long walks and did have many lounges to hire with umbrellas to give shade. There was a lot of nightlife on the beach which was exciting and colourful and music to enjoy."
mzdimplez s,2 contributions,Aug 2015,I thought I'd go to the beach and relax and read a book. That didn't happen. I was harassed for about two hours by hawkers. I kept saying no and they kept coming. I went to walk away and someone grabbed me and yelled at me for not buying anything. I would never go back and I am not impressed at all. 
Stuart S,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Probably wouldnt travel to this beach if we did not stay in the area. But it was good, clean and had little hawkers compared to elsewhere. Good restaurants in the area and go anywhere to view an awesome sunset. Great for kids to, lots of shallows and sand."
ThomasF,556 contributions,Aug 2015,"A nice place to go and see the sun set, of you do not want to go to Potato head or a hotel , find a beany bag place and just sit down with a beer and enjoy the sunset and the vibe"
Martin W,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Aug 2015,"Not many hawkers to bother you, nice and clean, life guards on duty through the day. Everybody was laid back and having fun, surf was O.K. Close to hotel and Capil beach bar and grill, easy walk."
Nugget1969,34 contributions,Aug 2015,"Great beach, good food, great night life,music,Bintang and the sunsets are great beautiful place to spend your days in bali"
annarhi,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2014,"Discovered the beach by walking through streets, was crowded and nothing special. Suddenly became bombarbed with people trying to sell me bracelets, henna tattoos, sarongs and even one lady pushing to sell me sarong clips. Feeling very overhwlemd by so many people crowding me for my money and hassling me. The woman selling me the sarong clip made me hold the item and refused to let me give it back. Needless to say after buying 6 bracelets, 2 sarongs, 2 clips and promosing to come back later for henna I left and never went back. "
Gizwiz81,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2015,"Loved hanging out on the Beach Hotel bean bags of an evening, cheap drinks and watching the sunset each day. Couldn't get any better. The beach is also full of life, live music, people playing soccer.. is just the best when you come from the hustle of a city."
Miss M,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,Beautiful sunsets to be seen while relaxing on bean bags at any of the bars along the beach.  Highly recommend. 
ska112233,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,We went here a few times during our stay in seminyak. Sun lounges by day.... Bean bags by night. Or just lay down a towel and enjoy it. Beautiful spot to watch the sunset. 
davidalexsz,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Seminyak Beach is perfect for couples or any solo traveler who desire to experience the beauty of nature. This particular beach in Bali offers tourists with perfect ambiance which enables you to appreciate Balinese beaches. Many resorts and villas are built along the beach, so accessibility is great!Don't forget to catch the Sunset moments when you are in Semminyak Beach.."
elsie l,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,"My 3rd visit to Seminyak. Going to the beach is always on the itinerary.  The sand is fine and clean and it a joy to walk, jog or just stroll especially in the early morning or evening to enjoy the cool breeze. On this 3rd visit, we decided to walk the entire stretch of the beach from Kuta back to Petitengit. It was a most enjoyable hour and a half walk with sandals in our hands, stopping now and then to take photos of the scenery and the people around us building sand castles, flying kites and playing beach volley ball and soccer.  We also get the know some of the beautiful hotels, pubs and restaurants along the beach.  It was also a good workout before we wash up and head to La Lucciola for our gourmet dinner! "
dee l,"London, UK",Aug 2015,clean great for surfing great bars and restaurants along the front and delightful beach.stalls selling kites sarongs jewellery etc who are fun to barter with  as well being able to buy their drinks and foods and rent beach chairs from make Seminyak beach a pleasure to swim surf sunbathe practise yoga and exercise or walk on 
neilsa,"Spring Park, MN",Aug 2015,Huge waves.. But noone surfing or swimming..this tells me dangerous undercurrent..great sunset. I'm.a convert next time .to look at hotels here. Beach relatively clean
Rob B,23 contributions,Aug 2015,"With there being many pretty beaches on bali, seminyak beach is filled with beanbags for maximum chillage. Though the atmosphere is nice it wasn't my kind of beach experience since there were do many people. There is a change for some nice waves though I've seen them get pretty big so beginners should surf here with caution."
TheRealAlvinLim,"Selangor, Malaysia",May 2015,I love beaches around Bali. It gave me the feeling that I'm free or happy I should say. Wi be back to this place. I took the entrance at KuDeTa. Just walking distance from Amadea hotel which I had stayed
GettingThereAndBack,"Helsinki, Finland",Aug 2015,"Seminyak's Beach offers a more secluded ambiance compared to its sister strands of Kuta and Legian to the south.The atmosphere is much more sophisticated and laid-back than Kuta or Legian, and the beach is quieter during the day. "
Sumaya K,"Jeddah, Saudi Arabia",Aug 2015,i likes this beach the most because of the waves which were great for surfing if you are not a surfer you can easily find a trainer which a good price an excellent area for relaxing
elmsie7,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,"The beach itself is ok and there are heaps of better beaches around the world but Seminyak has a number of very good bars and restaurants close by. Sunset is a great time for relaxing, having a few drinks and then pick a good restaurant nearby for the evening. There is always something going on. There is board, wetsuit and dive gear for hire."
Jo P,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2015,"We only went to the beach once, the hawkers make it an unbearable experience. Bali government would be wise to follow in Thailand's footsteps and make them illegal."
maryrose h,"Southampton, UK",Feb 2015,"Hotel looked like a concrete maze, but actually the next day when we got our bearings it was actually very good.Gorgeous swimming pool, surrounded with  beautiful tropical plants & trees. Staff very charming & helpful."
Nipun_Parikh,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2015,It's a very nice beach. Wide stretch of white sands with waves perfect for surfing. Has some beautiful restaurants and great beach clubs to view the perfect sunset. Lot's of places to rent a surf board.
freckl48,Victoria,Aug 2015,This beach Is a lot quieter than Kuta and perfect if you have children. Just the best sunsets also. Lots of eating places too
Subhasree789,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,Clean and happening at the beach! with lot of hotels put up a well lit and romantically decorated restaurants by the coastline!
atkinsba,"Ottawa, Canada",Aug 2015,"We spent a couple of odd days on the golden sand in the comfort of the Courtyard Marriott Beach Club where the staff are so friendly and have towels, bottled water and ice lollies on demand. It was at night though that it really came alive with all the roadside restaurants setting up tables and bean bags with candles down on the beach."
Dpradhan,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,Go there before 5 pm. Grab some beer and enjoy the sunset. The children do have a lot of fun. There are good eating joints along and  just outside the beach.
runawaysuzie,"Cairns, Australia",Aug 2015,"Crowded, hawkers, drunken tourists and noise. Sorry not a area of Bali I am interested in. If you come for culture and scenery then go north from ubud. This area is jus for cheap drunken tourists."
Sinan B,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Love it here. Relaxing, warm weather, lovely locals and cheap bintangs. What's there not to like? Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes"
leahlovesicecream,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,Great to relax on the beach :) beautiful spot to escape the madness of Bali traffic and enjoy a cocktail.
Cathy V,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"Great waves, but lots of rips. Listen to the life guards! Drinks available to buy on the beach but be wary of paying too much for sun lounges"
ChristinaPtr,"Thessaloniki, Greece",Aug 2015,"nice view, nice sunshet, nice place to chill, but not for swimming. if you are Greek you know what i mean..."
tony532015,"Bunbury, Australia",Apr 2015,"Stunning tidal beach offering something for everyone from top surfers, to belly boarders, to walking through shallows, good for kids, ideal for veryone."
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Aug 2015,"It's definitely more laid back than Kuta's. Some say its also more sophisticated. Wet part is dominated mostly by surfers, while sandy and dry one, by lazy vacationers under umbrellas. Food and drinks are available too. Decent restaurants and bars are just across the road behind. Some experts would say that fresh young Indonesian meat is for sale here too (mostly in the afternoon though). It has what it takes to have enjoyable few hours. "
The_Prof,"Darwin, Australia",Aug 2015,"A beach, smelly and the water was not really good to swim in. There are sections which are pristine (outside hotels) but some of it includes a sewerage run-off so be careful. "
Vandy85,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Aug 2015,A beach full of  beautiful and colourful cafes/bars. A sunset walk followed by some drinks and dinner under those colourful umbrellas is a good option for chillaxed evenings. But if you want clean sparkling water and silence then this in not the beach. Its got its own charm with a touristy touch. 
Josh J,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Aug 2015,"As we were staying nearby we spent four hours at this beach from 10am-2pm.The sands are a mixture of the usual colour and light grey, restaurants and hotel  pools line the small beach.There is a lot less people here than at Kuta and Legian beaches so it's ideal if you want a more chilled out beach experience in Bali.If swimming make sure you take extra care, swimming within the designated areas (flags) and not venturing out too far as the currents are strong. Would definitely not recommended any kids going into the sea.Overall, a nice beach for a break from the crowds."
Polo_and_Marco,"Guildford, UK",Sep 2014,The beach all along that coast is lovely and wide. The sand is nice and fine and you can rent loungers and parasols from the various beach bars. Its the perfect place to watch the sun set while sipping on a cold Bintang. The water is warm but there is generally some surf. I ticked off learning to surf on Seminyak Beach from my bucket list.
Julie R,"Wurenlos, Switzerland",Jul 2015,"Never have enough,,wish to stay more longer, we always looking forward to be here again..see you soon seminyak beach!!"
Hieke W,"Taupo District, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"Nice sandy beach, lots to see and lots to do.Many places to sit and have drinks and snacks.In the evening it is nicely lit."
priyank_traveller,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,This beach is quiet compared to Kuta but much cleaner and good if you want to spend some quality time with friends and family
bee992015,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"Seminyak Beach is very clean and relaxing surroundings, not to crowded, you can really enjoy your sunbathing or swimming or surfing"
fxign,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"For those of you who dont have a lot of time in bali, you can try seminyak beach. Instead of doing nothing at hotel, enjoy the beach here or eat near the seminyak beach, it offers a lot of restaurant / cafe"
PaulineMM,"Langwarrin, Australia",Aug 2015,A good beach for surfing and bogie boarding. To rent a lounge and umbrella was a bit expensive but worth it to stay out of the hot sun!
Rosetta P,28 contributions,Dec 2014,"I went here for new years night and it was one of the best nights of my life - music, dancing, drinks, fun, amazing fireworks, brilliant people just perfect night!"
goonercaz,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,"I visited the place with our little one.Big beach with lots of good surf. Days of wave did alternate so easy wave days were good for the little ones to paddle and stay safe.Disappointed though with the cleanness of the beach. Rubbish floating around the waters edge.Also  certain parts smelt so a sewage outlet may have been near by.The beaches volcanic residue means bathing suits get ruined so only wear dark coloured ones if you plan to do beach sand castle building. It would have been nice to have more beach restaurants as there were only big ones attached to hotels. The ones that were there had a high security manned setup, so not sure if the Bali bombing in Dec 2004 (?) stopped all all the smaller restaurants doing business. Would still visit the beach but keep it cleaner please."
claire255100,Melbourne,Aug 2015,"Nice long stretch of beach. Good for walks. Seems popular for surfing. The bars and music along the beach set the holiday scene.Occasionally there are sewerage run offs which smell pretty unpleasant. Didn't entice me to swim.I hear the sunsets are spectacular but unfortunately the volcanic ash created such a haze, that the sun was swallowed by thick cloud and no sunsets were to be enjoyed."
babybushka,30 contributions,Aug 2015,"Had a great time there - bigger surf and not many peddlers, a bit away from all the other people which was nice."
Compass2101,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"I guess a surfer who grew up riding the beautiful spots on Sydney's Northern Beaches is going to have a tough measuring stick!  Not a great beach break, however I did get one memorable 177m / 28.7km ride.  No headlands or reefs of interest.  The trade-winds blow cross-shore fairly early in the day.  You can rent deck chairs.  Shopping and bar in the area are good.  Potatohead and Ku De Ta are great - Check em out.  Better of surf the Bukit Peninsula!"
Ereny F,"Cairo, Egypt",Aug 2015,Beautiful clean beach ..great to watch sunset and relax. has nice restaurants and u can rent seats with umbrella.
ally,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,"Clean beautiful beach, good waves, with a couple of inexpensive cafes with wifi to choose from for lunch/dinner."
gygee_fan,bekasi,Aug 2015,"sands felt softer that kuta, expensive umbrella and beach seats rental (200k IDR for locals and 300k IDR for foreigners), good place to play at before noonunfortunately there was a big excavator running around for some building projects so I was worrying my toddler being close to it."
lovefoodNtrips,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Love the soft sands and calming sea! We went to the beach around the evening so it is great to look at. At night, there are a lot of restaurants that will set up chairs and table at the beach. You get to listen to the sound of the waves as you dine. A great experience indeed! however, you have to plan your route around tot he beach. The first time when we arrived, we were not clear of how to go and ended up arriving after the sun sets. We went there for a second time to catch the sunset. A tip, plan and ask clearly on how to go!"
Alexitan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,I love this beach. This is a bra for you to go if you prefer slow and serenity. Kuta beach however is more of a happening beach!My bf and I love this beach ! ^^ 
Merlantis,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"Lovely beach, interesting waves, loads of food, it's like the perfect set up, but the open sewers running onto and across the beach, which people ignore and simply walk through, kind of grosses me out. It's like this on other beaches along this southern stretch of coast too so it's just one of those things. Unless you want to walk for miles along the beach you may not even notice it. I noticed it a lot! The touts are there but they are not aggressive or persistent. Mainly just selling sarongs and paintings and sometimes quite odd things. But they don't pressure or annoy, they are just there.  Unlike the JetSki and paragliding touts in Patong who block your path and follow you and won't leave you alone!"
Brenden A,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2015,"Horse back riding.Back massage.ManicurePedicureFoot scrubTemporary tattooHair braidesLearn to wake board / surfJust soak up the sun and zzzzzz under the umbrella as you lay on the beach chair. Charges for 3 hours is 100,000 Rupiah. Full day - walk around and ask best price - haggle like crazy. Then pick a good spot to unwind.While peddlars are lesser than say Kuta and Denpasar beach, be firm when they start peddling you trinklets and unwanted services. Eye contact with them - Dont. They come and surround you like bees to a flower.Take a stroll along the coastline. I couldnt as I sprain my foot. Yet the peddlars were most understanding and made me more comfortable. Pedicure, foot scrub, nail varnish and back massage by three ladies. And free trinklets - wrist bands 😍😍 Bring a beach towel should you find the chairs rental steep. Bottled water, sun screen / block, hat, sunglasses and a good book.What I was looking for - a hammock under coconut trees to lay down with coconut juice / water. Alas.... bean bags and beach chairs aplenty."
Rioleb,"Beirut, Lebanon",May 2015,"Great surfing beach that is very affordable compared to US and LatAm even. Beers also are abundant and cheap. Not the most amazing beach in the world. Dont go there if you are expecting the famous picturesque clear water Bali beaches. Probably better to go to Nusa Dua.Also, the water is a bit dirty unfortunately :(End the day at KuDeTa or Potato Head for fancier drinks"
j01216,"Spa, Belgium",Aug 2015,"The beach is pretty nice but they are a lot of pollution like everywhere in Bali.. That is so bad because you swim between garbages.. (cans, chips packet,...) But still fun especially if you surf! "
Jabema,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,Seminyak beach was clean with plenty of dark yellow sand. Surf breaks seemed consistent. Swimming was confined to a few patrolled areas. Few vendors to annoy you. Plenty of restaurants fronting the beach. Multiple lounges for hire. Popular spot for local dog owners to exercise their pets although they were never a problem for beach goers. Nothing to make it a must visit beach over other Bali beaches.
Thong J,14 contributions,Aug 2015,"smooth fine sands, nice waves, great place for kids to play sand and for adults to chill and relax for the whole day!"
wheeliemandy,"Gosford, Australia",Jan 2015,being in a wheelchair i enjoyed the beach from a bar on the beach. Was a great spot to enjoy the sunset. You do get people selling things all the time but that is part of the Bali experience
Coleen P,"Wagga Wagga, Australia",Jul 2015,"Best was sitting on the beach in a bean bag, eating, listening to music and watching sunset.  Great to walk along in the mornings and very few sellers confronting you."
samuelsings,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"This is one long stretch of beach. My wofe and I walked for as long as an hour, sitting on the sand and people watching.Some visitors brought their dogs and locals were there too to enjoy the setting sun."
Travellor,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2015,"Lovely beach, be prepared for hawkers selling stuff. But overall great beach to visit. Plently of places to eat and relax. "
Julia2307,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Seminyak Beach is a long straight stretch of surf beach, heavily built up and used by one and all!  Edged by resorts, locals, cafes & beach shops, with resident dogs,it is inclined to collect rubbish from far & wide, but is ""groomed"" each morning so is OK.  I wouldn't swim in the surf... local streams drain into it! Great for early walks to get appetite up to indulge a breakfast, or wonderful sunset viewing as you sip your cocktails! .."
Jodie_L_Hart,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,Dirty dirty dirty! We travelled here in Dec/Jan 2014.... Terrible time to visit. Super busy and the currents send the rubbish down from Java. It was a massive disappointment
Ramesh Bachani B,16 contributions,Jun 2015,"While the sea bed gently slopes down,  unless one is a very powerful swimmer,  one needs to exercise caution here as the rip currents are very strong here.  Beautiful n clean with many eateries lining the beach.  Prices are reasonable too.. Deck chairs and boogie/surf boards available for rent. Highly recommended!"
Neil G,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"This beach is good to sit and watch the sunset but not a good swimming beach ,you get too many rips and tide movements . Again surrounded by many hotels and Villas .Also Seminyak centre just over the sand dunes for a relaxing dinner and drinks ."
Asish Agarwal,"Jeypore, India",Sep 2014,"Seminyak Beach is Bali's most fashionable place, home to among the island's best resorts and large number of fine restaurants >"
RMartinSDXB,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",Mar 2015,"One of the most beautiful sunsets I ever seen was here, in the beach of Seminyak where the sun drops down in a mix of beautiful colors. The beach as a beach is not the cleanest and the water is not as clear as in the beaches on the east coast but its a nice place to relax, specially during the afternoons."
Reg C,"Taree, Australia",Jul 2015,"Very good beach, close to hotel and shopping. Restaurants and bars on beach either sitting in restaurant or on the beach with umbrella and beach chairs or bean bags."
Annette088,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Clean, not too many hawkers, ok swimming if like waves, chairs to sit on for a cost. Lovely relaxing outlook with good umbrellas,  can hire boards etc if want or get drinks fruit etc "
Hatzlacha,Virginia,Aug 2015,"This beach has a bit of something for everyone.  It seems a bit north of Jl. Camplung Tanduk is the quieter area with lots of rentable beach chairs and space for water activities.  It was far from overcrowded.  South of the street began the row of bars, restaurants, and related party atmosphere.  Much more crowded.  Lots of conflicting noises on that side.  But there were plenty of waves when we visited and the water is warm.  Some dogs around but they mostly prefer the sunshine to people.  So it's a nice public beach everyone (adults and families alike) can enjoy.  "
grahamw309,"Semaphore, Australia",May 2015,"The beach at Seminyak is extremely busy with small bars and lounges for the tourists. Unfortunately, the strong currents mean that only experienced swimmers should attempt to enter the water here."
lil_miss_brum,"Kinver, UK",Jul 2015,Spent quite a bit of time on the beach - quite a few hawkers but they are very pleasant and won't bother you once you have said no thank you. The waves are great fun. We rented a body board and a surf board and tried out hand - mixed results but lots of fun!!
annettebeard,"Brighton, UK",Aug 2015,Beautiful unspoilt beach away from all the brashness of the main hack. Very safe beach despite large waves as lots of lifeguards and flags to ensure safety. Very pleasant family orientated beach.
8151ian,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Had a few bintangs on the beach just over the road from Cocoon.Great live local entertainment at nights  but some of the bars have the music up loud to try and drown out the bar next doors music.Was a bit windy most nights but still pleasant. More for the younger age group who like sitting in beanbags, relaxing and enjoying the atmposphere."
tagabukid,"Dumaguete City, Philippines",Jul 2015,"questionable hygiene and safety, seems no surf patrol and rips visible, quite a lot of plastics and empty bottles"
ebfootprints,4 contributions,May 2015,Great cocktails on the beach! Awesome sunsets! Waves are incredible! Beer cheap! Very relaxing place!
Mark J,"Didcot, UK",Jul 2015,"Having spent a week on the east coast at Sanur, I can safely say Seminyak's beach is far better, hands down. It's sandier, lighter and cleaner, plus it has much bigger and more impressive waves and fabulous sunsets. My family happily spent all day on the beach watching the surfers at play. The only negative is the hawkers trying to flog you their kites, hats, sarongs and watches. That said compared to other tourist hotspots they were not at all aggressive and quickly moved on after a quick no.We were staying at the Seminyak Beach Resort & Spa with attractive infinity pool overlooking the beach. I did spot two cheeky families rock up to the beach in front and then let their children enter the hotel pool. The hotel security didn't bat an eyelid, which was disappointing. Anyway it's a great beach, not at all crowded and the sunset views are pretty special. No need to traipse all the way over to join the crowds at Tanah Lot."
kim p,"Hitchin, UK",Jul 2015,Lovely beach but the sun beds are as expensive as Europe and here you get pestered by sellers walking up and down all day long. Make sure you barter for sun bed price 
Parky1968,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Less hawkers and more relaxing. Closer to more boutique bars, shops and restaurants. 30 min brisk walk to the outskirts of Kuta. Not as many beach bars and surf lessons."
Emilyprimrose,9 contributions,Jul 2015,"Sunset was lovely to watch and sit by the bean bags listening to music, I wouldn't eat on the beach though, the best place was Capil Beach but that was expensive, all the others had really bad food and seemed very dirty. The toilets in all the places bar Capil beach are awful "
annie23015,"Mandurah, Australia",Jul 2015,"Nice beach, at this time of year (July) the sand is clean, great spot to sit in a bean bag, listen to a band and have a drink"
EwaHagert,"Malmö, Sweden",Jul 2015,"Lovely long beach with white sand huge waves. Strong current at times. Lots of restaurants for lunch and dinners and absolutely amazing in the evening with after-beach cushions and lanterns. SO romantic.Beach chairs with umbrella is exensive. 300 000 ruphies for a day for 2 beds. However, sunbeds are super luxury so really a treat but if you plan to go to the beach everyday it adds up. Especially if you are a big family. WIndy."
RBNS8184,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,Best beach and quiet beach.Calm and walkable distance to seminyak square.view is good. Family goers can enjoy the beach but be careful the current is strong kids must be guided by their parents.photogenic place
S0412,"Island of Malta, Malta",Jul 2015,"amazing sunsets, nice and quiet during the day...restaurants located near by!don't forget your sunscreen and be careful the waves can be a bit rough at times!"
Hanna,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jul 2015,Worth the visit if staying in the area. It's more of a beach than lovina and is nice to walk along. Water seemed clean and there are areas with good waves. The beach is pretty clean but you come across public areas which have an increase in rubbish which is the only let down. The fancy hotels look after their sections of beach which is good. There are a few nice bars on the beach which are great to stop in for a drink.
Zac P,7 contributions,Nov 2014,Love the variety of bars and markets around this beach. A beautiful walk whether romantic or with friends.
Gerri m,Australia,Jul 2015,When you first arrive to Bali...and see this beach...you will love it...but once you have explored Bali's truly magnificent beaches this dosnt compare...nice for a stroll at sunset and looking at different Accommodation along the way.
Jeremy F,"Constantia, South Africa",Jul 2015,"The beach often has big waves and is rough, so its not great for swimming. It also has not got the best waves for surfing either, but every now and then the banks are ok. The beach club is very nice to hang out at and the vibe for tanning and having some drinks is pretty cool to. Dark sand and just not up there with many other beaches. More of a party and pic nic spot. "
Quinn E,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,ku de ta - always an essential  for dinig and cocktails. seminyak beach resort - accommodation. nice for night time walks 
OsakaShurling,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Perfect sand and sea. What makes Bali famous. Soft powdery sand, beautiful sea - with pretty strong waves for the surfing enthusiasts."
ibm_gaurav,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2015,"This was a awesome beach we visited while in Seminyak region. It has high waves, but the beach is shallow, so we could go in and enjoy the waves. Very good beach for surfers due to good high waves.The sand is packed and dense, so one can easily walk on beach and enjoy long strolls.The beach is very near to the famous Seminyak Square."
winardini,31 contributions,Aug 2014,"Good beach, clean enough. Recliners and umbrellas were up for rent. You can have a good coconut, or just sodas and mineral water for a small fee. When you're hungry, go to the restaurants facing the beach. "
ronval1912,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,we went in the afternoon. didn't find it particularly nice and the beach is littered with ciggie butts
FABourdain,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"I consider myself a bit of an expert on nice beaches.  Seminyak is a great beach with nice sand.  It's a very wide beach, and when the tide is out it can be 200 meters or more wide.  There is no drop off, and the bottom is sandy.  Great for surfing, body surfing and swimming.  There are some rip currents when the surf is big, so pay attention to the flags.  You can also rent chairs with umbrellas if you don't want to lay in the sand.  Plenty of restaurants on the beach, and great for sunsets.  I'd give it 5 stars,but…  there is a definite problem with the amount of plastic garbage that washes up on the beach.  And here's my suggestion - the government should take a portion of the entry tax they collect and hire people to pick up the beach.  People work for very little in Bali.  Start on one end and just pick it up.  With tourism seemingly the main industry in Bali, I'm surprised they don't do a better job.  And the hawkers can become a bit much as well.  I mean, I don't really need a painting of an elephant or buddah.  "
KiwiGe0rge,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jul 2015,Beach is quite steep and dumpy - especially at the change of tide tide. Keep an eye on your kids. More relaxed than the Kuta end of the beach. Less sellers and pumping music. Nice and relaxing.
NickiKMelbourne,Melbourne,Jul 2015,The beach was great but you do get bombarded by hawkers a bit - eventually they left us alone until the next batch arrived an hour later!
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,"This is the most fashionable beach area on the island with luxurious hotels, fashionable clubs and fine dining restaurants. Lovely to watch sunset here and then the whole area comes alive after that!"
jackirmic,"Austinmer, Australia",Jul 2015,Lovely clean beach. We enjoyed running of a morning at sunrise. It was a great way to greet each day. The sunsets were magical. 
Imogen D,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,"Pretty, especcially at sunset. recommended to u all. luv it. for the lovers of free spirits and ego wounded souls"
TrishFD,"Canberra, Australia",Jul 2015,"clean, clear water. great sunsets. great surf for swimming and body surfing.  great to walk along.  easy access to all Seminyak activities, restaurants and resorts"
jdb339,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,Much better beach than Kuta or Legian. Is easy to get to and has a good selection of places to eat. Good place to relax at
OliverMalcolm,"Athens, Greece",Jul 2015,"The beach itself is pretty average. The sand is quite grey and ash coloured. As a beach, a much better choice would be dreamland beach. But Seminyak beach is easy to get to, great to walk up and down, and has all the beach clubs located on it. It's a much nicer way of walking to the main part of Seminyak than along the roads."
engelangie,Czech Republic,Jul 2015,"Lovely beach and a great place to just relax, take stroll or hang out with friends. The beach is relatively clean."
Compass Bali Tour,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jul 2015,not really nice but still ok ;)in sunset time it's will be nice..but to many people here and not really clean.i prepare going to balangan beach
stéphane B,"Geneva, Switzerland",Jul 2015,The seminyak beach is the best on on the kuta - legian - seminyak side as it is large and lits of space to seat. Sun seats are great - not that cheap for Bali - and there are cool restaurants on the beach
Utantan,"Kobe, Japan",Aug 2014,"Seminyak beach is a great place to go for so many possibilities. Deserted or almost so in early morning for a great run on the beach (half marathon distance possible !), crowded in the evening with seaside bars pumping their music, great waves to enjoy, many fantastic restaurants to eat in if you venture a bit into the streets, great shopping within walking distance, the occasional ceremony with Balinese people gathering to let their offerings go into the sea, an evening drink at La Luciola. Yes, Seminyak is polluted, too crowded and not as authentic as it used to be 15 years back but it's still one of the best place to visit in the area !"
Wetwedgie,"London, UK",Jul 2015,"Truly beautiful beach, which is alot quieter than legian and kuta. Great just to hangout on the beach or walk up and down taking in all the awesome of Bali."
NoVolcanicAsh,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,the boys say that the hamburgers in the black bread rolls are the best. They had burger meals with chips and lemonade.
YK N,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2015,"We heard so much about Seminyak Beach therefore we decided to visit this popular place on a weekday.  We walked for about 15 minutes from Seminyak Square and reached the beach through KudeTa at about 5.00pm.   The beach was quite crowded with both locals and foreigners, and there were a lot of sellers who approaches you all the time with their junks.  The beach is not that clean compared to those on the eastern side of the island."
Wayan Arjana,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"nice beach for see sun set, walk a long the beach to see a lot of nice restaurant such as kudeta, lauciola, potato head beach club and many others. use your sun screen for protection. don forget bring a sarong if you want to visit petitenget temple."
ThompsonBuggins,"Bushmills, UK",Jul 2015,"Loved the fact that it was not as crowded with beach visitors, benches etc and that it was still enough people around that you could enjoy the buzz of the beach. Watching surfers, having the kids play in the waves and sand and going for runs made it our favourite beach in Seminyak. "
marke07,Sydney,Jul 2015,"A long shallow beach which felt safe, and provided just enough swell to allow some fun on the boogie boards. It was quite clean (though it looks much nicer at high tide than low), and economical sun beds and umbrellas for hire, along with surf & boogie boards."
Phill B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2015,"I like the beach and it's a great place to eat and drink, be mindful of the many junk sellers who may harass you at times. Also remember a beach chair should cost no more than $5AUD a day. I'd advise going to outer beaches if you are looking to surf."
Donny J,46 contributions,Jul 2015,"Nice beach away from the crowded area kuta, with vibrant store and villa, the waves is good. Waiting for sunset here is a must."
BenLane76,"South Yarra, Australia",Jul 2015,Hit the beach early with the locals as it's the best part of the day to get some exercise done before hitting the pool or what evere else you have planned!
riotheelephant,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Jun 2015,"The beach was alright and a nice place to chill and relax, but there's a lot nicer beach around Bali - I really recommend Uluwatu!!"
Ben M,"Dallas, TX",Apr 2015,The beach itself is pretty dirty and not as idyllic as I thought it would be however that's why the hotels have pools. Still a great place to visit and see a sunset
KiwiMat 7,55 contributions,Jun 2015,Atmosphere and views was great. We relaxed on the beach while the children played in the sand and we had a beer
achiichan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,It's really a beautiful beach and it's good for sunset. Many cafes and rstaurant around there so that we can eat dinner while waiting for sunset. It's romantic and beautiful^^
BigBronco351,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,"Great to wander down to the beach just before sunset and lob in a bean bag, order a drink, maybe a meal listen to the music and watch the sun set over the ocean - Perfect!"
Mike,35 contributions,Aug 2014,"Great place to chill out and have a beer on the beach, Seminyak is renowned for the finer things in Bali, though people say it's expensive that's only by Bali standards, you can expect to pay Australian prices at the restaurants."
Stacey H,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach was not pleasant at all. The sand was streaked with black, obviously from oil, which meant there weren't very many people on the beach either. I suspect that it's visited mainly in the late afternoon evening due to all the bars/restaurants on the beach, but in the morning it's just gross."
Paul M,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"Its the beach side of Kuta without the mess of it. Its a little more expensive for everything i.e. surfboards and beach chairs but its worth the additional expense as its far more quaint, especially with KudeTa playing nice lounge music in the background"
Farrah T,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2014,Bali has changed so much over the past 10 years but one thing that has remained the same is the amazing sun set views that you get to experience from the beach. 
Jodie C,73 contributions,Jun 2015,"The beaches in the built up areas of Bali are a bit hit and miss. Unfortunately the practice of making offerings the the Gods on the beach, Many of which containing, plastic wrapped lollies and cigarettes, leads to a beaches strewn with debris. It is such a shame. The Seminyak beach had rubbish floating in it which is a bit disconcerting for an Australian but the warm water and beautiful blue skies are bound to draw you in and out past the shoreline mess."
Harshit_V2,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2015,It has an amazing Sunset and the beach is really clean and you can just sit on the many shacks on the beach and enjoy the sunset alongwith a drink
CelestineSwee,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2015,"Went there for the sunset. The beach is really pretty and crowded. Good mix of locals and foreigners. However the toilets are very rundown and doesn't offer much privacy, so you should wear your swimwear there, otherwise it is hard to change. Many restaurants and bars lining the beach to choose from, but most of them are pricey. Beware of local men secretly taking photos of girls in swimwear."
rowQld,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2014,Visiting Bali for the first time was so exciting and Seminyak Beach was one of the great spots that we really enjoyed. We will came back again soon.
KaKwok,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,"Ummmm.... it's a beach. What can I say. When we were there, there we night markets, shows and so on but we just got scammed that day so in a less then happy mood. Still, having said that, the wife did like the night life and it made her smile so you take what you want out of that"
Helen G,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2014,"Lovely beach where you can relax,swim and unwindThere are bars on the beach with music and diningThere's also a bean bag bar which is so bohoThere are tables with lamps and beanbags-finished off nicely with a Bintang !:)"
yo_graham,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Feb 2015,"The sea was too choppy to go in, and there were pesky peddlers bugging you to buy something. Most people were in the pool in nearby resorts. "
Truthful Reviews,"London, UK",Jul 2015,"We stayed at the Oberoi (see my review) and visited the beach several times to see the amazing sunset. I've got an old iphone4 and people thought my pics were photo shopped....they were not. The sea, sand and sky did all the talking.....and it was all talking to the sun as it said selemat malam for the night. WOW AMAZING!"
Shaliqua,Geelong,Jun 2015,"I love Seminyak Beach with its long stretches of sand and surf! It is a great place to take a long walk or run before the sun gets too hot, and then a swim afterwards. I enjoyed a lounger and drink on the beach, but made a mistake when making a purchase with a hawker of goods. One buy and I was inundated with people trying to sell me overpriced goods. I found that my no must have sounded more like a yes to them, because I ended up with foot and hand massages, plucked eyebrows, jewellery and other goods, most of which I paid too much for. But for all that, I did enjoy myself! I learnt a huge lesson on not being a sucker for a friendly lady who had supposedly not made any sales that day as she had just come a funeral! I had a good laugh that day and did come away with a sense of fun and joy even though I had been shamelessly been taken advantage of. You just need to be stronger than me! It is a glorious beach though!"
amyz_world,500 contributions,Jul 2015,"This beach has a beautiful sunset advantage point, the colours of the sky is amazing that I couldn't stop taking pictures of it. It's very touristy and so many people on it, so if you're wanting a quiet beach go elsewhere."
Ian C,"Carlisle, UK",Jun 2015,"Some nice beach bars with not bad music ,we didn't do any sunbathing on the beach so I can't give an accurate review on that but I was informed that the sea was not too clean "
RizaL Sulaeman,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"the most popular spot to have a sunset, most people flock to this area however some people just simply hang around at the public area of the beach and others just spread out to the nicest restaurant or bar around the beach. It is the trendy beach in the island"
Madamjojo1,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach was really rough, the current dragged our 9 year old out a couple of times so we couldn't really relax and enjoy the swim.  Great for surfers though!  The sand was that yucky black kind that sticks to everything, you need a chair to sunbake."
BhumikaWadhwa,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2015,"Average beach, good crowd...Good place to watch the sunset! We tried many restaurants along this beach..Overall good experience.."
John W,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,Great views but pit about the volcanic soil making the beach black and the pollution. I will not swim in the water.
Ian,"London, UK",Jun 2015,Just sit on the beach and watch the sunset. It's probably one of the most relaxing thing to do in Bali. 
sheetalkhandekar,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,This can be totally skipped. Private beaches at many hotels are much better maintained than the public beach.
Jeisre,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2014,"I visited in 2010 for the first time and was taken aback by the stunning sunset, however even then the beach itself wasn't great, and it grossly deteriorated ever since. Dirty, grey-ish sand, lots of rubbish, which is not cleaned. The water was murky and muddy, and wasn't inviting at all. One of the locals on a later visit also advised me that it wasn't 'good' to swim, especially after the rain, when all the inland rubbish gets washed via the streams into the bay. I saw lots of nasties floating in those streams, so would agree with that advice. It's such a shame that no one takes responsibility for keeping it clean, as it would have attracted many more tourists if it was maintained. The sunsets are beautiful and many people come to the beach-side bars just for it. Any beach-going experience will most certainly be interrupted by the local hawkers trying to sell you something."
BenGtho,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,the beach if further away from city center or kuta/legian area and seminyak is considered as expensive area now.not much to say about the beach frankly; it's the same as other beaches in bali imo.
Grace B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Relaxing. A real holiday feel, especially at sunset when you are able to choose amongst the many restaurants along the beach, find a bean bag to relax on, eat drink and listen to live music. I prefer swimming in the beaches not so populated, which there are plenty of. Seminyak is great for good food and shopping also. It does need to be careful not to become to pricey as this may deter a lot of travellers. Ubud for day spas is an absolute must!"
CarolChia,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"I like the beach, coffee plantation and rice plantation.  The food in Bali is very good. One of the Indonesia restaurant known as Warung Mina located at Jln Kayu Putih No. 19, the food is excellent and value for money."
JamesSharpe,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"Nice views, but dirty beach. The local authority needs to do more to tidy up after all the bogans! Other than that very nice, with friendly beach bars. For the gay traveller seek out Bali Joes, who will give you an amazing welcome. And COOOOOOLD beers! "
EnglBellaItalia,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"Aaah... this is hard to write. I love being by the ocean and on a beach, and this beach has pros and cons.The views of the sunset are outstanding at this beach. There are many eating and drinking possibilites everywhere, and the ocean is clean if a little rough - hence the amount of surfers that congregate here to do their thing.The road leading to the beach is constantly busy with mopeds and Vespa-like vehicles. It is something to watch the weaving in and out fo these riders, and it's a wonder how they do not fall off their vehicles, or hit people or things as they go... but they don't! What I didn't care for was the constant being asked to buy things from the local sellers on the beach. In truth I felt sorry for them. They were only trying to make a living by selling local stuff to tourists. But mostly, the tourists just want a beach holiday without the albeit friendly (but intrusive and cnstant all the same) harassment to buy all kinds of stuff. I was only here four days, but it really began to get on my nerves by the end of the second day.The beach itself might disappoint someone if they were epecting tropical white sandy beaches... the sand is a dark brown/grey due to its volcanic origin.All in all, not my favourite beach in the world, but I can see me being on it again, once I have forgotten how annoying the sellers can be."
Neve,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Mar 2015,There's no better way to unwind after a hot day walking the Seminyak streets for a bargain or visiting the local attractions than to sit on Seminyak beach. Take in the sunset while sitting in the Seminyak sand drinking a beer or cocktail. The many local establishments serve light meals and drinks amongst beanbags and dim lights.
Caroline C,GB,May 2015,"Great beach, not white sand but full of atmosphere. At night the beach bars extend out onto the beach, great music, beautiful sunsets. Lots of safe swimming"
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"We like to meet up with friends along this section of the beach, rent 2 long chairs and umbrella for 50,000rp for the day and then make sure to swim between the flags as there are strong rips along the beach."
BaliSharks,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Crazy, never seen a beach commercialized like this.  Now view as all the umbrellas and beach chairs take up all the natural space.  Sad.  Rainy season its full of trash due to the winds & currents as rains wash rubbish into the seas. Island of the Gods must be pissed.  Bukit beaches or outside the commercial zones are more pleasant.  However there can be nice sunsets from that side."
Le M,"Mount Duneed, Australia",Jun 2015,Seminyak beach in June was pretty clean and rubbush free (for a Bali beach). It was great to people watch with Ex-Pats walking their 'horse-like' dogs and locals participating in ceremonies as the sun rises. The sand is still pretty grey but the setting is lovely worth the effort of a walk in the steamy air.
Sebastian_Hui,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,You should be there in the morning and sunset! The endless Indian Ocean makes you WOW! Some people jog on the beach in the morning and some people walk their dogs in the noon time. I love it day and night!
Laura M,18 contributions,May 2015,"Well we found it to be very dirty  the sand after walking a short distance leaves a blackish residue on your feet, so for us walking along the pathways beside the beach was fine. We found much the same conditions at other beaches, however one very positive note, the sunsets are spectacular.  For the rest of our flexible holiday we headed inland, maybe no ocean but jungle is something else. Additionally where we live in Australia we are right on the beach so perhaps a little spoilt!"
Ingrid T,"Lusaka, Zambia",Jun 2015,We had a swim around nine in the morning. Tthe beach was clean and the water warm and lovely. Our hotel Sarinande was just a short walk back.
traveller5605,"Tumby Bay, Australia",May 2015,"Plenty of beachfront restaurants to watch sunset from along Seminyak Beach. Book a restaurant and arrive early enough for sunset, one with happy hour even better"
jo C,"Gisborne, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"We walked from our resort in Seminyak down the beach to Legian.  Took about an huor and was enjoyed by mum, dad and 4 kids.  Lots of beach bars/resorts along the way to buy drinks.  Also a few hagglers selling sunglasses which was funny for the kids to deal with"
DrSuz_12,"Ogden, UT",Jun 2015,"We stayed at the beach and walked in the surf every morning. The food is so good with a view of the sunset. We enjoyed the fitness room, too!Since it was an anniversary trip, the hotel upgraded us to a beautiful suite with a private pool at the Garden. This morning, I saw huge lizard about 2 feet long. He was afraid of me and hurriedly dove into the pond and swam away.  There are beautiful grounds, flowers, and solicitous staff. It is truly a paradise. Tonight, we are going on an elephant ride in the sunset. "
Steven J,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"We are blessed with some fabulous beaches in Australia so comparisons are dangerous. Seminyak had dirty surf on the couple of times we hit the beach (the pool at the villa was much more inviting!). Like most beaches, it pays to swim where it's safe and listen to the lifeguards - we did see one mature gentleman saved from a rip."
farpavilions,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,Mmmm....not for me.....too much 'stuff' littering the beach. Even though a tractor travels along the beach 'raking' it is not so effective. After rain the water looks disgusting and dumping waves serve as caution to bathers.
Leedon73,Singapore,Jun 2015,"Huge long beach with mild surf. It's very flat, you can walk about 150 to 200 meters towards the sea before hitting the water. Wind was great for kite flying. Very safe for young children. Sand blackish, but fine. Only problem with beach was slight unpleasant smell of rotting vegetation. "
minninme,minninme,Jun 2015,Sunsets are great but during the day the place gets so crowded that I'd stay away. Go early in the morning (like 7am-8am) if you insist on seeing it during the daylight.
TheKristopher,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"The beach can be covered in litter during the day from selfish tourists but lovely to walk on at night, soft sand and lots of restaurants on the beach itself."
Stormie,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2015,The sunsets on this beach are amazing. Lots of great hotels and restaurants all along this beach. A little quieter than Kuta. 
Janis J,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"My husband went daily to swim and loved every minute of it.Lovely long sandy beach with sand cleaned daily, People walking, swimming enjoying."
Sheena B,"London, UK",Jun 2015,"Very clean beach in a lovely scenic setting, no selelrs on the beach which was a great bonus, sunset is amazing"
Geraldine M,78 contributions,Feb 2015,The beach isn't great in Seminyak but there is plenty of hotels and beachclubs surrounding it that you can get the benefit of an amazing beach sunset. Some of the hotels have cleaned their area up but overall it isnt a great beach
Cdm104,"Durham, NC",Jul 2014,"It's a beach to sit and enjoy the atmosphere, there were a good number of surfers. There are a lot of rocks so it's not about swimming."
Charlotte F,"Brussels, Belgium",Jun 2015,"We rent a bodyboard, a sunbed and we spent the whole day at Seminyak Beach! One of the best activities I did, very affordable (110K for the day for two). The beach in itself is nice, not the most beautiful one in Bali but not too overcrowded."
Ritazell,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2015,"Wide black sand beach,  suitable for novice surf board riders.Not great for swimmers.  In fact, the only people in the water were kids, learning to ride boards"
KIMDEE63,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"The beach was a great place to pull up a bean bag and listen to some music whilst watching the sunset and the waves roll in.  You can also surf although the waves weren't overly big, I think if your looking for surf maybe you need to go to Echo Beach or other surf beaches with bigger waves.The dislike about the beach is the black sand."
DhruvThakkar,73 contributions,Jun 2015,Has a wide beach area where one can enjoy a nice walk in the evening watching the sunset. Very clean. The noise from the seafront restaurants starts from sundown which is a negative
PHKORL,246 contributions,May 2015,"Absolutely loved the sunset view from out hotel room. If you plan on staying in Seminyak, it's best to stay in W Retreat or any beach front villas. Seminyak is so populated and commercialized now, so staying in a secluded area is rewarding. "
Nomadlookingtosettle,"Bengaluru, India",Apr 2015,"Seminyak beach is a beautiful beach. You can find plenty of vendors  for beach benches and umbrellas at reasonable rates. If some one is interested in surfing, there are a couple of surfing schools right on the beach. One thing to be careful about is where you get your money exchanged for local currency. You will find plenty of small shops claiming to be 'authorized currency dealers', however a vast majority of them give you less money than what is mentioned at the shop entrance.Particularly, one member of their team will distract you with general questions while the person handling the currency will hand you less money than what they owe you. So always count the money yourself even if the shop owners counted it in fornt of you. We wound "" Central K"" group of shops very reliable when it came to money exchange. If you are looking of good art work and wood work, I would recommend buying it from Ubud where you will find products with better quality. "
nadap905,"Montreal, Canada",Jun 2015,better to go to Kuta beach the chairs and rest areas are better and closer. People ignored the off limit areas which was embarrassing as a foreigner we should respect local traditions. In this case no swimming because of holy site
Lea32_11,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,"I was very disappointed in my trip here having heard so much about Seminyak and its beachReally this is just one very long beach that stretches from Kuta and beyond Seminyak.With so many 'world' restaurants I was hard pressed to find one serving the local food.the beach vendors (of which there are many) were pushy which added to my sad trip to this place.Basically the tourists have pretty much ruined these places in Bali, too many people for the infrastructure and everyone trying to get their $ from the tourists (and you cannot blame them)"
vox-sf,"Chicago, IL",Sep 2014,"This is a broad, fairly maintained, if a bit rough patch of surf.  We walked up and down it at least once.  There were a few people out.  Some fisherman to avoid, too."
Amanda,"Trinity Beach, Australia",Apr 2015,"It was nice and clean, no rubbish in April. Had lunch at Ku De Ta not to may hawkers around. Wasn't very busy this time of year.."
8rigittamelisa,Indonesia,Jul 2014,"When I stay at one of the budget hotels in the area of Seminyak, the next morning I decided to wake up early to enjoy the sunrise on Seminyak Beach.It only takes about 5 minutes to walk from the hotel to the beach.You can enjoy the morning air of Seminyak area.And alsomany people who ran or cycled in the morning.Nice scenery in the morning!"
Angela W,"Wellington, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"The beach was pretty and reasonably clean. There were people swimming and surfing. Just a shame that every 5 minutes someone is trying to sell you a chair, a foot massage, earrings, boogie board or time share."
Sally H,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,Generally the sea was too rough to swim in . There are plenty of nice restaurants to eat at and to watch the sunset from.
Sarah M,Melbourne,Jun 2015,"Great for drinks and dinner on the beach - La Plancha is brilliant, we ate prawns and chicken along with. Urges and curry - all was fantastic! "
Smotherone99,"Greater Perth, Australia",May 2015,we spent a lovely evening sitting on big comfy bean bags sipping cocktails on the beach at sunset....
nathan060721,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Not bad considering it is in Bali. Black/Grey sand and pretty clean. Also, the water was a great temp and the street food by the beach amazing!"
ezjosa,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"The Seminyak beach is located not really far from Kuta. The place itself is cleaner than Kuta, but please don't expect less crowd here. My visit was during the sunset time and it was a pleasurable experience. Watching the sun goes down, looking at the sky, and hear the wave voice, so amazing! I would love to come back again to enjoy this beautiful view!"
Kemistry,UK,Jun 2015,"busy beach, which may explain the colour of the sand…was a little disappointed, thought it would be cleaner. Lots of people. Nice to watch the sunset if the sky is clear."
Farah E,7 contributions,May 2015,After having come from the southern tip of Bali I stayed in Seminyak at the W. I had an incredible ocean view room and slept and woke to this vivacious beast-the Indian Ocean. It was very different from the Southern Bali ocean experience of calm and quiet. The beach had a lot of dog walkers so wear shoes. But expect to take them off when there's a breech in the sand and you have to wade through a bit of water to get to continue your  beach walk. This side of the island seemed risky to be in the Ocean. 
Peter C,"Newcastle, Australia",Jun 2015,Serioulsy? Bali may once have been a cheap place to go but that is no longer the case in Seminyak at least so there is little to justify spending a lot of money to leave Australia for the purpose of beach-going. The beach is uninteresting and uninviting.  The surf is large and the water murky.  The sand is grey.  Unsurprisingly no one swims there! 
Lynne P,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,Its a perfectly good beach if you haven't grown up in Australia. Its quite a compliment to say its nearly as good as Leighton or Cottesloe beaches in Perth. 
Leslie H,"Burleigh Heads, Australia",Jun 2015,Popular with swimmers and surfers during the day at night you can eat at many small restaurants on the sand and watch the sunset
Rahuli786,"Rohtak, India",Jun 2015,Depending on what you like this beach may be good or bad for you.Beach front is mostly occupied by big hotels and there are only few local restaurants .You can hardly find any local vendors selling eatables here .On the positive side crowd is not much and if you prefer to relax in a quiet place ;best place for you.
KazLamberton,Hobart,Jun 2015,"We dined at a couple of the beachside restuarants overlooking the many diners, etc on bean bags on the beach. Lovely atmosphere, relaxed and low priced. "
Edward M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,This is an experience not to missSitting on bean bags on the beach Having a quiet drink or meal watching such Sensational Sunsets
Rian C,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"The beach is quite long, and there's plenty of space to roam. Unfortunately, it is also frequented by hawkers who can be quite intrusive and annoying. If one ventures far enough, it is not uncommon to walk into areas covered in garbage... the smell of which lingers in the air. As long as one stays within the areas in front of/near the luxury beach side resorts, it would be difficult to find anything to complain about. The sand is soft and welcoming, and the water is clear. The tide can be a bit strong in areas (there are multiple advisories that recommend against swimming), which can be restrictive if one wants some semblance of privacy."
Rorkor,"Hong Kong, China",May 2015,"Large beach, was not too crowded, a few hawkers, some trash, strong waves and currents, beautiful sunsets"
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jun 2015,"Beautiful to watch the sun setting and see all the planes flying in. Very relaxing, and entertaining, lots of sellers, but be firm and they go away. Safe for children, who can enjoy watching the amazing waves rolling in. Every one seems happy and enjoying what the beach has to offer"
Ronny P,Perth,May 2015,Its a nice beach clean and most of the locals will leave you alone I love to chat to the locals so i have a great time lots of fun.go for it.
Mazstar2001,"Cairns, Australia",Jun 2015,It's beautiful day or night on the beach. Sunsets are amazing. I got tired of saying no to the Hugh amount of sellers
Laurie R,"Rochester, MI",May 2015,"this beach may not be clean, but has great sunset views at nearby restaurants and bars that line the beach.  Lounge chairs for rent are easy to find, and there are plenty of beach bars along the beach where you can sit in the shade while watching the surf schools catching some waves."
michyap0705,KOTA KINABALU,May 2015,seminyak beach just wonderful and relax. set with nice coach on beach and you can just enjoy your romantic dinner there. no fancy dressing but relax beach wear! lovely!
TaiDofu,Taipei,May 2015,"This beach is pretty and is not in Kuta!  The waves were strong, big, and many!  This is more of a family beach than Kuta, and there are chairs that can be rented that make staying there long hours more convenient."
Tyrone P,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Enjoy the wam water and the excellent service provided by the many resturants located by the seaside ,lots of entertainment in the evening ."
月亮說,"Hong Kong, China",May 2015,The beach with big wave which is good for surfing. Its good to hear the voice of the ocean when dining on the beach.
joung h,South Korea,May 2015,"The beach is beautiful, clean and very attractive. We loved the sunset and warm sands. Our honeymoon time in Bali was the greatest moment and experience we had. "
Isabelle M,17 contributions,May 2015,"If you want to walk forever this is the perfect beach to do so, even if there is lots of people this beach is huge and lots of room to share, when the tide is low, the sand is perfect for jogging and speed walking, locals play soccer on th beach and it is a very oriented activity beach, standup paddle, surfing, boogieboard etc...The sand is not white but clean and pebble free, no need for shoes on the beach or in the water. It is clean in general compare to KUTA and LEGIAN but still some garbages in the water, they try to maintained it clean with workers in the morninsg which is nice to see. Lots of little paying spots to park your body and lay in the sun all day with shades and umbrellas. from having travel all over bali, this beach has it all, little restaurants to fancy Hollywood type bar and lounges to hotel and epxensive villa. really appreciated the time spend there and did not wanted to go at first. Amazing sunset and accessible to all."
Jeki I,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2015,"The Beach is perfectly right in the heart of the most famous spot in Bali, Seminyak has become a destination to visit not just for the foreigners but it also become a lifestyle gigs for the local tourist, you can go in the sunset time to this beach and you will see how people likes to hangout and see the sunset together with friends and colleague... "
Jeanette O,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2015,"The surf was excellent, and beautiful to watch. The sand was not golden, but dark coloured and I know you shouldn't compare, but not a patch on Qld beaches. The sand was so damn hot, couldn't walk on it, even with thongs......plenty of lounges which was excellent. Such a shame though to see so many hawkers and their filthy makeshift stands, really spoils the beach, but totally understand that tourism is their source of income. With labour being so cheap, it wouldn't be too difficult to clean it all up and have containers for their storage of stuff made colourful and clean, would be so more appealing and tourist would be more keen to buy stuff."
PDalal24,"Mumbai, India",May 2015,"Great beach to enjoy early morning as it gets really hot in day time. Clean place , ample recliners to rent and laze about"
VSplan,"Mumbai, India",May 2015,"Seminyak beach is great for walking around, surfing, swimming, sunset view and for lazing around with a drink by the beachside cafes"
Brad G,"Tasmania, Australia",May 2015,"Is THE place to be to watch an amazing sunset. Very busy towards the sunset, so best to get their early and lounge on one of the beach beds that you can rent from the locals. Lots of places to eat along the beach front, and plenty of places to learn to surf or hire surf equipment. "
cmsvai09,"Ludwigsburg, Germany",May 2015,"Busy beach with many sewage water flows and swimming plastics. Not suitable for a swim, also due to dangerous currents.However, nice sunset watching."
Heel4Life90,"New York City, NY",May 2015,This is the must do beach.  All of the hotspots of Seminyak can be accessed from the beach. The water is not best compared to other parts of Bali but overall good.  Downside is all of the vendors trying to sell you stuff which takes away from the relaxation time. Be sure to checkout one of the bars closer to Kuta to sit out on the bean bags and watch the sunset. Pretty kewl at night.
ianpB8845EF,"Bunbury, Australia",May 2015,"Relaxing.  The sound of the waves rolling in and the slower pace was great.  As with most of Bali's beaches, would be great if the dogs and rubbish were gone."
Kamilneu,"Ostrava, Czech Republic",May 2015,Be aware of huge waves and streams sometimes . It is much safer in the afternoon.................................................................
470iputua,Indonesia,May 2015,Seminyak one of the beaches to retreat so that the touris so impressed to see the beauty of the beaches of Seminyak
Meera R,"London, UK",May 2015,very quiet clean and high security- you feel very safeNice romantic walkclose to Ku DE TA and potatoe head
ChilliGarlic,"Marrickville, Australia",May 2015,"Our hotel opened on to this beach, which is wide, patrolled and with waves that you can surf or body surf. Great! Plenty of washed-up rubbish on the tide-line, but it did appear to be removed each day. Lounges and food are cheap and this end of the stretch isn't crowded."
Sharon M,"Lymington, UK",May 2015,"WE loved to go down to the beach at around 5.30, after a busy day sightseeing. Grab a seat, or beanbag at one of the many bars,order a super cold Bintang local beer (try the Radler lemon, its amazing) and chill out, people watch and relax. Fantastic!!"
jamie m,singapore,May 2015,"Great beach if it was not for the thoughtless dog owners who walk this beach while their dogs are not leached, they run all over sniffing your belongings you have in your bag while their owners just stand by looking as stupid as their dogs, so I can't recommend this beach at all."
Megan C,"Townsville, Australia",May 2015,"nice clean beach, the beach sellers get very annoying though. There are no lifesavers so you need to watch out if you have children."
jsethu,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2015,Calm beach a bit crowded over the weekends. The locals were friendly and my son enjoyed the surfing . The sewage entering the beach was a put off for me
kazo,"Braintree, UK",May 2015,Went on Sunday so watch sunset. It's a busy beach with lots of locals and tourists. Not great sand and choppy sea. 
dry_surfing,"Huntington Beach, CA",Apr 2015,"went on a overcast morning, the water was warm, wave was nice and sand was not over heated like it would be on a sunny day."
Gavin__Hope,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2015,Wide open spaces with a broad surf. Didn't see many swimmers. Nice to walk or jog along the beach. A bit dirty in spots
Yoko L,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2015,"Clean beach with relax and laidback surrounding and welcoming tennant. Souvenir seller still offer you a thing or two but not that pushy, they have their own area to kept clean and sell their goods, fair enough. Love the scenery, really nice breeze, just pick a coconut and enjoy."
Lisl A,16 contributions,Apr 2015,Loved it and great to relax with bintangi beers and have swims - the sea was great better than last year which i visited in June and it was quite rough to swim.
nickfromParis,"Paris, France",May 2015,"I spent 4 days on this beach , nice atmosphere in daytime with surfers , beach restaurants and at night ,after sunset , with bars on the beach offering live music while you see the colors of the sky changing , amazing!And if U do not surf , you can swim , where is permitted , skipping the waves... Much better place to swim than Sanur! Also very nice for walking on the beach in the early morning , at low tide....enjoy!"
David_Marsh_11,Gold Coast QLD,Apr 2015,"Excess rubbish on the beach, seems like no one cleans up after they leave. There is a small number of cleaners that concentrate on a small area of the beach"
Oldlorrie,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2015,The many and varied eateries along the beaches were a great place to sit and chill with a cold Bintang and watch the glorious sunsets!
Tripti B,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,The beach is nice and the sand is fine. There are few shacks to enjoy beer or coconut water. The water was good and my daughter particularly enjoyed it.
Abhijit_In,India,May 2015,We loved sipping beer and eating finger food at one of the beach side restaurants.  The service was prompt and friendly.  One of the waiters even drove me to a nearby ATM to pay the bill :-)
CirclethePacific,Canada,Mar 2015,"This was our last stop on a 6month trip and the beach was great, lots of fun in the surf and many places to eat, drink and people watch.  Remember this is Asia, so the beaches are a bit dirty and may have some garbage.  Don't let that ruin your experience."
MHafiqAR,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",Apr 2015,"Walk along the beach and enjoy the white sandy beach! Strong wave and good for surfing.. Love the hang out area with bean bag and acoustic music, such a perfect place to hang out with friends or even your love ones :D"
Craig C,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,Rest  under a beach umbrella and on a comfortable beach lounge whilst drinking a beer . Disliked the black sand
Gerald2463,"Mangalore, India",Apr 2015,Not too crowded like Kuta. Walked along the beach and relaxed with a few cocktails on one of the resort restaurants on the beach side.
Dayborotravellers,Iceland,Apr 2015,"We are from QLD so we are spoilt where beaches are concerned.  There was lots of rubbish and brown sand, waves were too big to swim.  Unfortunately most of Bali that we saw, didnt have nice beaches but that doesnt matter when you have beautiful pools!"
NMilne,"Vancouver, Canada",May 2015,"Came to this beach two times over two days, and teh second day was too much. The hawkers are quite annoying, and persistent, they will come back every hour to offer you the same item you already turned down. One lady started touching my feet while I was asleep suntanning on a chair, that bothered me, although she wanted to sell me a foot massage, I didn't appreciate her touching me unexpected and unwanted.What is great here though are the lounge chairs with an umbrella for 50K/ all day, and there is surfing and many good beach restaurants with bean bag chairs and cheap ice cold Bintang. Stick around for a beautiful sunset and cocktail. All you need is one day here, any more than that and the garbage, hawkers and smells may bother you."
ggmmii,"Chennai (Madras), India",Apr 2015,"This definitely had lesser people than the kuta beach but still was quite crowded.Its a long beach and a must visit if you are in seminyak.We spent the evening having dinner at one of restaurants along the beach-even-though the food wasn't great,the ambiance and sitting on those comfy informal seating where you can lie down and gaze at the sky and the stretching horizons was a memorable experience."
Marjiegene,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2015,Garbage and broken glass would not go in past my knees here. Have to really be on the look out for broken glass in sand.
Paul B,"Enschede, Overijssel, Netherlands",Apr 2015,"As a natural Beach you will have to travel far to find something as pristine as this. however depending on the time of the year it can be really busy. most annoying are the ""Traders"". it is a continious pattern of trying to sell you something. From Kites to Watches."
Njays,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2015,"I don't think you go to Bali for the beaches...and if you do my friend, there is quite a bit of the world for you to see yet.The beach in Seminyak was a dull grey colour...quite a few pieces of rubbish on the sand...a lot of bad smells and frankly you'd pay me (a heck of a lot) to go for a swim there.Visitors please do care. Bali is a wonderful place but it has, as in any developing countries, a lot of work to be done in terms of getting their sewage sorted. At this point  a lot of it ends up...yes you've got it! in the spot where you want to go swim! So go back to your resort and jump in the pool!"
Zwinky1,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,"The beach is nice and clean. As it is a very touristy spot it is of course crowded.There are also some people that are trying to sell things on the beach. When we were there, the current was pretty strong so we couldn't go in the water really."
PlanetOz,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2015,"My wife and I were staying at the Double Six Luxury Hotel, so the beach is merely right in front of the hotel. The Hotel even has a security cordoned off area with lounges for guests to enjoy the scenery and the sunset."
KeithCarr-Glynn,"Maroochydore, Australia",Apr 2015,We were delivered to the beach by golf cart from our hotel.  The sand is grey and gritty.  The number of people on the beach reflected the state of tourism currently in Bali - it was practically deserted.  There were the usual annoying hawkers but a couple of acceptable beach cafes.  The surf today (23/04/2015) was poor though a few diehards were out.  Not a very inspiring place.
Wendy D,"Byron Bay, Australia",Apr 2015,The sellers were buzzing around but we found them entertaining! The sunset is amazing. Many people but not too crowded to get a nice beanbag & plonk yourself down with a Bintang! A must do! Prices were great at the bar - even for the food. 
Nam_Onrit,"Bangkok, Thailand",Apr 2015,"Along Seminyak beach, there are cafes and bars which serving a variety of cocktails, local and Western food.Cafes are packed since evening, they place bean bags on the beach with music bands playing cool reggae.What a wonderful time, having dinner on the beach!"
LeeHarvey,"Caulfield, Australia",Mar 2015,"The sun setting over the water was amazingly beautiful.The rolling waves looked like they should have far more people enjoying them.The walks along the beach were lonely - traveling solo, and not many fellow walkers.The sand was more like dirt than sandThe rubbish on the foreshore indicated that no-one really cared."
Simon_Carter77,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2015,"This seems like a great area of the beach, if you can embrace the hawkers, or at least not have them detract from your experience.The bars along the beach are well set-up to cater for those wanting a drink or a meal, with comfy bean-bags and umbrellas.First thing in the morning is great for running along the beach, with packed sand from the tide."
MareeJP,"East London, South Africa",Apr 2015,"After strolling down the beach one early afternoon we settled in to the bean bags out side of a Bar/ restaurant,""sorry cant remember the name"" had the most fantastic vibe and of course plenty cold beers... Sunset was amazing highly recommended way to spend an afternoon at leasure"
Erik K,"Da Nang, Vietnam",Apr 2015,"Not much more to do in Seminyak then lying on the beach and go shopping < although there are some original (clothing) shops there, do expect to see a lot of Aussi surf brands there too ...Found little of Indonesian/ Bali culture left ....Very 'touristic' and the streets are quite busy during 6-10 in the evening.Many street sellers, taxis/ cars, beach sellers and a general over-population ...Maybe this is a 'natural' development, and me being part of it should not complain so much, but nevertheless I found the visit a bit .... disappointing ... and probably will not return there.If you do go, make sure to visit restaurant Sate Bali, so at least you get some beautiful & tasty 'Bali food'!http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g469404-d1182566-Reviews-Sate_Bali-Seminyak_Bali.html"
Ellie L,"Daylesford, Australia",Apr 2015,I decided to walk on the beach towards Legian.  A guy asked if I wanted a chair however I found several ladies all wanted to provide their services.  I didn't really approve however they were so persistent so I let them & paid them.  Apart from this the beach was very quiet.Ellie
patboot,"Saskatoon, Canada",Apr 2015,Loved the body surfing and the warm water! We spent every morning at the beach and in the water! The best stretch is in front of the Oberoi Hotel!
KezzaBurton,"Burton upon Trent, UK",Apr 2015,Great place to sit with a beer and watch the sun setting over the Java sea. The sea is great for surfers here and is so lovely and warm
peatuhacs,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,"The further away you go from Kuta Beach towards Seminyak, the beach becomes less crowded and that's one of the things I like about Seminyak Beach.There are a few bars, restaurants, and beach resorts along the beach and also a warung (food stall) along the beach. Warung Cantina and Mosaic Beachclub are located on the northwestern end of the beach. Potato Head beachclub is located more towards the Kuta side of the beach. Closer to Kuta the beach can sometimes stink of sewerage, and that's one of the reason I avoided the Kuta side of the beach. The further northwest you go, the beach is less crowded and more nicer. A good place to see the sunset too. Very beautiful.You can also hire pool chairs and umbrellas from the locals for a cheap price and enjoy the view and the breeze."
Janine N,"Gympie, Australia",Apr 2015,this was the first beach we saw and thought it to be very average - we had better at home. We would not go swimming I the beach.
nicandian820,"Rochester, UK",Apr 2015,"Warning...please be careful when using the money changers in the few shops outside the Ku De Ta. they are called the Big Boss money change and they ripped us off for RP700,00 approx £30 even though I counted the money 4 times, they still managed the slip notes out. They bambosle you with RP50,000 notes and try to distract you. I know £30 is not a lot but when you are on a budget that can be 3 meals. Made me very distrustful of people and ruined Seminyak for me. Beach lovely but vendors renting sunbeds also tried ripping us off asking for RP200,00 for 2 hours, rather sit on the sand. In sanur, sunbeds RP40,000 - RP50,000 for all day. Even though we stayed in Seminyak we ventured into Kuta which we preferred in the long run"
Dave E,"Queensland, Australia",Jun 2014,Lots to do or nothing. Always interesting people down there. lots of eateries & beach bars to checkout. Walk up to Legian for lunch or further up to catch a boat out to the reef breaks for a surf. 
Garryraff,"Canberra, Australia",Mar 2015,"Cleaning machines scour the beach when the tide is in, leaving the most disgusting detritus when the tide goes out. "
Jay M,"Liverpool, UK",Apr 2015,"The beach here is a bit grotty but head for the shacks and enjoy a beer or cocktail watching the sunsetPlenty of hawkers but they will keep walking with a firm ""no thanks""Great surfI thought Kuta beach better for a day out"
FrankO713,"Douglas, UK",Mar 2015,"Dirty, lots of plastic in the sea and on the beach.Noisy several very noisy places along this beach."
bhurd42,"Ottawa, Canada",Mar 2015,"Good walking sand, warm waters.  Sunsets are great.  Watching sandlife during rising tides shows various 'creatures' and their creative life patterns on the beach."
chriswalsh365,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,The beach stretches for kms in both directions and is dotted with small bars and restaurants and warungs. Surfing is everywhere although there are lots of rips so take care. The sand is hard and great for walking. It's also a great place to watch the sunset
Meredith S,"Newcastle, Australia",Apr 2015,"great place to swim, not big waves to learn to surf, cheap drinks on the beach, have to haggle on price for lounges, if you don't mind being pesters by hawkers, nice and relaxing."
Charlotte81,England,Apr 2015,"I recently stayed at the W Hotel on Seminyak Beach.  I'd researched prior to my visit, so knew this wasn't going to be a place of beauty in Bali.  The beach was fine, however the water was too rough to swim in.  There were a few people out surfing and a couple of locals in the sea further down the beach.  The litter wasn't too bad (I understand it's much worse during the Wet season).  If you're looking for a beautiful beach on the island of Bali, I suggest you go elsewhere.  "
M F,Washington,Mar 2015,"I stayed with my family at the Royal Beach Seminyak Resort/Hotel for three nights. We had come out to the beach area adjacent to the hotel grounds after dinner. Both times the tide was very low, and we could walk a long distance before we finally hit the water. The night was clear and the sky had a quarter moon surrounded by bright stars, We had taken some beautiful photos despite the darkness."
AlKo33,"Allendale, New Jersey",Jan 2015,"There were lots of rental for chair and umbrella. The beach area was nice but recommend to wear a sandal to walk on the sand, it gets very hot during the late morning. There were lots of garbage came back from the wave and it wasn't pleasant to stay in the water to long."
BezzaPezza,"London, England, United Kingdom",Mar 2015,"OK, the actual beach is pretty grim - used syringes and nappies washed up. But go to one of the beach bars to watch the sunset, you will not be disappointed. Just steer clear of the actual shoreline, if you want a strip of sand go further up towards Potato Head"
Balilover2,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2014,"it really doesnt matter what part of this kuta stretch of coastline you spend your beach days on , but certainly there are less beach hawkers the further you get away from the actual kuta stretch of beach . there also seems to be more facilities seminyak stretch opposite the beach more restaraunts etc , and I also reckon the corn on the cob vendor has the best grilled corn in bali which is saying something , seminyak also has the best warungs near by too as well as the best tour coordinator in all of indonesia called Seminyak transport community. his name is Ian and he makes everything happen without the hassles and rip offs .cheers"
CuppyCakes1810,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Come about 5.30pm and grab a couple beach chair for Rp40,000 (for 2) and just watch the sun go down! Beautiful. Of course you are not the only one watching, therefore you should not mind the noise from other visitors. :)"
LoSmith27,"Shanghai, China",Mar 2015,"I wish I could give Seminyak a better review, but every day I was there was a wasted day of an otherwise amazing trip. I was told not to expect much from the beaches but I did not expect the amount of trash and wasted that laid everywhere. Both Kuta and Seminyak streets were crowded with motor bikes and cars which made it really difficult to walk the streets comfortably. If you would like to visit this area I would suggest staying only 1-2 days if that. The best would be to take a day trip there from another area that is less crowded."
N. Shah,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2015,"The Beach is definitely much better than Kuta, it is a little less busy has a few shacks. Good beach to go sit in a shack and have a drink or two."
Alan Gelder,"Adamstown, Australia",Jun 2014,"Seminyak is the dining capital of Bali, with some really upscale restaurants in their own private bays. I've rated some of these individually.As far as south Bali goes Seminyak is number one,- in beach cleanliness, accommodation, shopping & dining.It is comparable to Candi Dasa in the N.E."
Lyndel Y,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Apr 2014,It's a beautiful beach that has unfortunately been spoiled with polution & rubbish. Personally I would not swim at the beaches between Kuta & Seminyak. It's definitely worth venturing out further if you're a beach lover.
Jenny S,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2015,"The Seminyak Beach is not as busy as Kuta.  Along the beach frontage are a number of restaurants that have bean bags and tables on the beach which you can sit down and be waited on for dinner, drinks and enjoy the sunset view to boot.  Very enjoyable and relaxing."
Jess L,"Plano, TX",Mar 2015,"Magnificent view of sunset, comfortable beach bars, civilized crowds, endless choice of restaurants with open terrace seating facing the ocean. The path way between the hotels and beach is not well lit."
TassieLoopyLou,"Devonport, Australia",Feb 2015,We took a motor bike to check out the beaches and went to Seminyak beach first of a few. We were not impressed by all the rubble and rubbish lying around. It is also dangerous with a very strong under tow which got me by the ankles and within seconds had me off my feet and sucking me out deeper. Very scary so you need to take care. Nice place to have a relaxing drink and cool down. Friendly bar/stall owners but still get harassed by people selling things.
0911whitney,"Del Mar, CA",Mar 2015,"Seminyak beach is NOT good. Extremely polluted and the brown sand leaves something to be desired. However, the resorts that are along it are fabulous! Stick to resort life and skip the beach walks."
MattwalesNorthWales,"Chengdu, China",Mar 2015,"Of course beaches get dirty, generally the busier they are the more rubbish lazy people leave behind. Admittedly I visited in March which is well out of season but the litter levels were minimal. The water is warm, there can be a strong undertow so pay attention to the warning flags. At the North end of the beach is an area set aside for Hindu ceremonies so avoid that. Further north is the local ""gay"" beach and if you walk south you will get to Kuta beach. Plenty of surf shacks, drinks stalls, bars and local sales people are available here too."
radenayu,Bogor,Nov 2014,"I really love spending time here. Usually I came here around 4, pick a spot at Taris Bali, and then go swimming or just playing on the beach until 5. After that, I dry myself and then just enjoy my cold beer on a comfy beanbag. On some nights, you can also enjoy live music at Taris Bali."
tazman1099,"Houston, TX",Mar 2015,"Seminyak Beach is MUCH cleaner than Kuta.  Plenty of bars on the beach with chairs to sit on, and reasonably priced drinks, usually 25,000 (about $2 US).Sunsets are AMAZING!"
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Mar 2015,"It's a shame that an upscale resort like Seminyak doesn't have a better beach than this. Whilst not without its good parts, large areas are dirty and full of rubbish making them unpleasant to walk on. I know this is the case for many of Bali's beaches but surely something could be done to minimise the mess.That said, it's a great place to eat, drink, relax, swim, surf, body board or whatever. Comfy sunbeds with parasols can be rented at 100k rupia for two per day and watching the sea is mesmerising. There's always something going on and someone trying to sell you something!"
denise p,"Taylors Lakes, Australia",Jan 2015,"We were so disappointed and quite disgusted. The beach along Kuta, Legion and Seminyak was dirty and full of rubbish. We spent 10 days in Bali and did not swim in the beach once, thankfully the places we stayed at had great swimming pools. For such a popular tourist spot, something needs to be done about this problem. Maybe starting with educating people about rubbish disposal. "
SumitKukreja83,"Bengaluru, India",Dec 2014,"The beaches on the western side of Bali are worst during the wet season from November to February. Garbage from nearby islands would make these beaches worst. However, Southern Bali beaches are better and more beautiful."
Dannielle B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2015,"We visited the beach at night, it was beautiful on sunset however as the waves rolled in a lot of rubbish came in with it. "
Chris-Olgui F,"Miami, FL",Feb 2015,This was the only beach i could surf at the waves were perfect. Def would go back. There was some annoying people trying to sell stuff non stop though. 
Lorna M,93 contributions,Mar 2015,"really liked seminyak beach during the day. The sand is clean as is the sea. The waves are quite strong and there are lots of beginner surf lesions going on in the mornings as there are more waves than in the afternoon when the tide goes way out. There are a few beach restaurants for a nice lunch and the sunset was also gorgeous. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people hassling you to buy hats, sunglasses etc all day and the beach chairs are not cheap. Didn't get to see the beach at night due to the Nyepi festival, everywhere was closed! "
LinusLee,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,"Not a white sand beach. went there for sunset but it's a shame that it was rather cloudy. lots of activities happening along the beach, unless you enjoy people watching, if not it can be rather boring. Other beaches should be nicer."
Maureen F,"Geelong, Australia",Mar 2015,Just came back from a couple of weeks in Seminyak and Canggu.  It was so disappointing to see all of the rubbish on the beach and in the water.  I have been going to Bali since the early 1980s and have been progressively concerned about the over-development along the lower west coast and pollution.   There was actually too much rubbish in the water for my wife and I to swim this time (plastic rubbish and probably worse).  I love the Balinese people but the rubbish and water quality is becoming unacceptable here.  Don't think that I will return.
ebyrne80,"Yeadon, UK",Mar 2015,"We decided for a walk on the beach and maybe a swim. Once we got down to it we were disgusted by the sight of it, its just full of rubbish, filthy and stinks bad. We even joked that you wouldn't be surprised  a dead dog on the beach but you probably would its that bad. In front of the hotels they clean it up each morning but the bits in between are left. Just a big disappointment as we were looking forward to a swim"
Stephen W,London,Jan 2015,"Very disappointed in Seminyak beach, actually I was shocked! It was not at all what I expected of Bali. Yes it is over-touristed which often has some side effects, but this was just a sad sight to see."
JessMorgan,"Oxenford, Australia",Feb 2015,we hardly ever went to the beach because its just full of rubbish! make sure if you sit on one of the lounge chairs expect to pay $5 AU
IAN S,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,The beach was polluted and feeble attempts to clean it up were next to useless. What more can I say.
Gary T,"Queensland, Australia",Mar 2015,"Dark sand with rubbish and lots of timber on the beach, obviously wet season runoff. Dry season may be better. "
GlobalPete2010,"Wailua, HI",Mar 2015,It is great to walk up and down this very expansive beach in front of many hotels.  You can see the jets flying from the Denpasar airport in the distance.  The sunsets are amazing in spite of some cloudy days during our visit.  This is not a swimming area and there is a lot of litter to avoid while walking.  This is a big negative but we were still able to capture many awesome photos of the surf and sky.
Vania K,"Seattle, WA",Mar 2015,"Seminyak Beach is a beautiful beach to look at. Unfortunately, any beach in Bali would be pretty polluted. As someone who grew up in Indonesia, I wish we'd paid more attention to keeping our beautiful country clean, but it was just never a priority and hopefully that's changing soon and our environment would be getting a little more TLC. Seminyak, Legian and other beaches along this coastline are great for surfing, body/boogie boarding, and watching the sunset. They are not good for swimming or snorkeling as the waves are too big. If you walk along the stretches of private beaches (exclusive to resort guests), they are likely to be clean, but go into the water and you'll likely spot some garbage (plastic bags, paper towel, piece of stick, anything you can think of) floating around. As far as the area itself, Seminyak is a hot spot, second busiest to Kuta with an older, slightly more sophisticated crowd. There are cute little shops, both modern and traditional restaurants, and bars with happy hour deals and live entertainment just about any night of the week. On the weekends (especially Saturday night), the place is a zoo. If you're looking for a little peace and quiet, you probably won't find it in Seminyak unless it's off-season and/or you're staying at a resort with a private beach. If you are looking to swim or do other water sports, Tanjung Benoa, Nusa Dua and beaches on the other coast would be much better. Plus, they also tend to be cleaner."
Nicole D,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,A great way to finish the day by watching the sunset with a drink on a beanbag. Lots of bars to choose from
kcfallen,"Houston, TX",Feb 2015,"If you go during rainy season, just understand in advance that the beach will probably be dirty and trash-ridden. My husband and I went late February and had this expectation beforehand so weren't surprised although it was still disappointing and disheartening to see. We did observe many people raking but it's probably difficult to stay ahead of all the trash washing on the shore. While it's not super bad to deal with, I wouldn't come to Bali just for the beaches and hope anyone traveling out of their way to come here would do their research and plan to spend more time inland. But if you are looking to spend time on the beach and happen to come to Bali during rainy season, you'll probably enjoy the southern (e.g. Pecatu) or eastern coast (maybe Nusa Dua) more."
SurfBee09,"East Lansing, MI",Oct 2014,"Dark, hot sand.  Definitely will need to rent an umbrella and lounge chairs.  Beautiful and delicious restaurants right on the beach! Great shopping nearby as well."
LeavemeinBali,"Western Australia, Australia",Feb 2015,"The beaches when we were there this month were covered in rubbish brought to the Bali beaches with the currents, very unfortunate. The tractors are busy in the morning doing what they can to clean up, this being funded by some of the hotels along Seminyak Beach. The government sadly, we were told does not contribute to the clean up. There is a transformation late afternoon when the sun starts to dip into the sea, families, locals and visitors all flock to the beaches to enjoy the cooler weather, the bean bag beach clubs, and to play soccer. Its a great atmosphere even though its crowded. Colored umbrellas color the horizon. These clubs seem to start north of Double Six Rd. Expect traffic jams as half of Bali spills onto the beach at sunset!  Hawkers do still try to tempt you with an array of selfie sticks, bracelets, kites and sarongs. Great place to watch the world go by sipping a Mojito or two while listening to live music. Thankyou Bali!"
Ryan R,"Lafayette, IN",Feb 2015,Pull up some bean bag chairs and enjoy cocktails and nibbles and music at any of the beach bars while watching the sun set;  A fun way to spend an evening.  Downside is the beach can get very crowded and the local peddlers can be annoyingly persistent.
Shazbuckles65,50 contributions,Feb 2015,"Bali beaches are not clean but they are raked and cleaned regularly. In peak season they are done more frequently, when I went in June they were a lot cleaner.Hawkers are a nuisance but you get used to it, it is their income and means of living.Theives and pick pockets are rife so watch what you carry with you.It was a good time of year to walk along the beach as it was so much quieter with a lot less tourists than in the month of June. In June it was so packed it was uncomfortable."
Stargazer2015,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2015,"Nice white soft sand, but not an impressive beach. I'm told it's a public beach for surfers.The shops on the roads leading to the Beach are good for budget shopping. I couldn't find any shell necklaces, which I wanted to take back as souvenirs."
Charles S,"London, UK",Mar 2015,"Traveled from the UK based on the reviews from other posts about Seminyak beach.After a not so pleasant check in, we decided to take a walk down to the beach. We were hounded by the taxi drivers and young men on the motorbikes asking if we needed a ride!!!!!!First impressions of the beach were very disappointing, I was hoping to find clear blue waters and a soft clean sandy beach.However, the beach was littered with plastic bottles, empty bags and wrappers,etc.Bali needs to ensure that their beaches are kept clean, after all, we tourists spend thousands of pounds to visit here.We were deliberately short changed twice at two of the local minute marts. Second time it happened, I pointed this out and I got the correct change after annoying looks from the staff!Don,t stop to ask the price of anything as you will get ripped off. Avoid the taxis at any cost.Only use BLUE BIRD TAXI as they all use the meter any other taxi will hustle you major and pretend to be BLUE BIRD, and avoid random men stopping in their cars asking you if you need a lift. Keep your wallets and bags close as I felt uncomfortable when the men kept stopping on their motorbikes and trying to talk to us.The sole purpose of the locals is to try and rip you off, it,s best not to entertain them or try and hold any conversation.For a country with such potential to create a amazing experience, it,s sadly let down by dirty beaches, street hustles and overly aggressive locals at every  three meters!I would not recommend Bali as a honey moon destination, it is really for the young surfers and backpackers.Don,t waste all your hard earned cash to come here."
TettyfromJakarta,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"Most of the beach is surrounded by lux hotels, so less access for public to enjoy this beach. Somehow it is cleaner than Kuta beach. Enjoy sunset and surfing too.  "
Pat B,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,Enjoy the sunset in the evening. So beautiful! In the evening there is a live music and we sit enjoy the music.
Peppy569,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2015,"Plenty of people about swimming, many restaurants at this beach but the water is dirty and much pollution, plastic, bottles floating where people swimming!!! Not for us, pool at the hotel was fantastic so no need to swim at this beach"
Clive G,"Formentera Del Segura, Spain",Mar 2015,"this beach is of black sand and the beach is full of litter and crap, nowhere near clean. it looks like a tractor runs along the length of it every morning to try and scrape up the garbage washed up on the beach. you also get pestered by sellers of beach chairs and shade as you walk along. not the best beaches for me."
MM27APR20154,"Tampa, FL",Dec 2014,I visited several beaches in Bali during my 3 weeks there and I found this to be one of the most beautiful and peaceful spots on the island. There were plenty of surfers and locals to make the time people watching pass with joy! Very beautiful at sunset!
Tyler W,"Edmonton, Canada",Feb 2015,The Seminyak Beach is very nice as the sand is perfectly smooth (although also very hot!). There is lots of space throughout the beach so it never felt crowded. Beach chairs with umbrella are available for a small fee($2-5) and are recommended to have some shade from the hot sun. Perfect for an early morning jog or sunset stroll!
Batikh,"Shenzhen, China",Feb 2015,There were some hawkers strolling the beach but they were not too intense about you buying things.  There was a good amount of beach between the umbrellas and the water for our kids to play in.  The water was also shallow for a good distance to allow some playing without worry for our young children.Negotiate with the umbrella men as they like to get hourly prices but you can get the whole day for not much more. There was some plastic in the water from time to time but it's hard to complain when the waves were as vigorous as they were.
pachanga496,Asia,Feb 2015,dirty dirty dirtyI don't know how people can call it clean ! I guess it's just flotsam from the ocean but it's a mess and ugly
Trevor N,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,The beach is quite clean now and you hardly get hassled by sellers.we enjoy the long walk and the different chats you can have with the locals.they tell you what is happening.
grb903,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2015,liked watching the Sunset on the beach and being there with the family. There are many people who sell their stuff.
Micheal T,"Terrigal, Australia",Feb 2015,Big beach but some-what dirty ... i would say that the beach clubs and restaurants  made it a lot better for the atmosphere at sunset We went to La Pranche for the sunset with friends .. great atmosphere overlooking the sunset.
Anikanepal,"Kathmandu, Nepal",Jan 2015,Clean and nice with good places to eat. Nice place to surf.  You will find a lot of trainers / nail artist etc here.
haksi,Ranchi,Feb 2015,A great beach with a reasonably shallow shelf so that even non swimmers can bathe comfortably. Evenings come alive with the music from several eateries with bean bags and chairs to enjoy the place. You may get a lot of salesmen peddling their wares but they are not at all persistent so not a bother. The sunsets are really great to enjoy with a beer or coconut drink alongside.
sugiphang,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"how poor I am, even every years take 2-3 times for visit Bali but it's my first time going to Seminyak Beach that only a few from Kuta. So, was a great place for enjoy the sunset and there's so many beach club there. If you want to some cheaper beach club, you must going to double six or Gado Gado beach next to Anantara Resort. Perfect time for enjoy the Sunset is 17.30 to 19.00, but if you want get perfect seat at the clubs must going there before 17.00 would be crowd after that. The beach is clean and good wave for surfing, or you can riding a horse. Soccer and made some sand castle must be awesome. Will be back again "
roncon09,"Hanoi, Vietnam",Feb 2015,"Initially, it is pretty stunning and the water seemed nice. It was a bit disturbing to have plastic things floating around and latching on to my feet. It was more than a bit disturbing to see that someone(s) had just left their smoked cigarettes smashed out on the ground like the beach was their private ashtray. I know that the locals are combatting this with clean ups and I wish them luck. It was cool to see young students interviewing foreigners for their English school. It is nice that the place has a pleasant wholesome vibe. "
agarwalabhi,"Kingston, Saint Andrew, Jamaica",Feb 2015,Beach is good with some good restaurants overlooking the sea and sunset.Good time to go is around sun set.
RichardSa2014,"Bramley, UK",Jan 2015,"Covered in litter and totally unsafe to walk on, we found a used syringe. I was expecting beautiful beaches,so disappointed with waht we found. This is where Bali will fail as a tourist area."
barve,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2015,As beaches go it is nothing exceptional. We went in near the KuDeTa entrance and it was quite crowded. The beach is wide but nothing spectacular
Colin B,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2015,"We both love beaches and my trave partner liked Seminyak beach more than I did. He loved he vibe, especially at sunset where we stood by the trendy Ku De Ta bar with all the beautiful people. I agree about the good vibe, but I just found this beach rather dirty and grubby. Water like sludge, rubbish everywhere and people hassling you to buy their wares."
Kylie F,"Singleton, Australia",Feb 2015,The sun beds and umbrellas where a great touch on the beach but the rubish that had washed up onto the shore was not. Not the whole length of Seminyak beach was like this so take the time to walk along the beach to find the perfect spot. My son hired a boggy board from a local on the beach which he really injoyed.
Shayne S,"Golden Bay, Australia",Feb 2015,"The sunset bars and restaurants are a heavenly idea, the rubbish on the beach that washes up is disappointing, but the sunsets are amazing especially with a drink in hand.  Great place to people watch and see locals walk their dogs."
Xscape,99 contributions,Jan 2015,"Could have so much potential.  The trash just ruined it for me.  So sad and so bad, how do they get this in control.  Thousands of plastic straws in the sand and they had just finished raking the garbage with bull dozer.  Had to wear shoes to avoid cuts from garbage."
Blok45Serbia,"Belgrade, Serbia",Oct 2014,"Nowhere to hide from sun...Carefree children playing in the ocean, surfing, snorkling....Spotless endless sandy beach is like on a postcard. Waves are sometimes very big so you have to tace care of seaside signes"
johnmV2630SE,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"The Seminyak beach is a health hazard and should be closed immediately. I wanted to go in for a swim but it was just too dirty... some of the rubbish looked like medical waste? I overheard a Sydney guy say it was probably the dirtiest water he has ever seen. When I asked him what he did for a living he said, 'I am an inspector for Sydney Water.'"
Jameschang71,Shanghai,Jan 2015,"went to kuta, legian beach, but this one was ""cleanest"". Still obviously had garbage and hawkers. but better than others."

nedveddenise,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,"The view and less over-crowded. Not many people walking there. The restaurant, especially the Potato Head Bar is very good, though a little bit expensive."
19T-K91,"Middlesbrough, UK",Feb 2015,Busy but not loud - plenty of hawkers will harass you though but a firm no will get them to leave you alone. Very cheap loungers (25k for a day)
Jo D,33 contributions,Jan 2015,The beach doesn't compare with the beaches at home.  There was just too much rubbish around.  Wouldn't let the children walk around without shoes it was that bad.  The scoop and filter the sand but the problem is bigger than their present solution.
D Balduino C,"Rio das Ostras, RJ",Feb 2015,"Very nice beach, clean, with a lot of restaurants and all services. Great for a drink or dinner at sunset."
The.HoggerBlogger,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2014,There are a lot of beach side shacks which offer a lot of deals by which you get drinks and food for a cheaper price than that on the menu.
Vindav,"Mangalore, India",Jan 2015,Dirty beach unfit for swimming ....fit only for a walk....pity....with so may world class hotels on the beach.
bolts,"Austin, TX",Jan 2015,"This is our second visit in 3 years and the filth unfortunately got worse. If anything, I'd recommend walking along the beach an hour before sunset and settle in one of the cafes on the beach (Ku De Ta or Potato Head). It's still a beautiful sunset worth watching."
Calvin C,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,Very fantastic view to watch sunset.  Travel to Potato Head with beach wear to enjoy the sunset view at their pool.  Night time also a great place to enjoy the moon and stars after dinner!
Jack E,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"Very disappointed in what is claimed to be a 'beach'. By Australian standards this beach doesn't even rate; ugly black brown sand, refuse constantly being raked up by locals, serious feeling of absolute filth. Vendors of sun lounges and umbrellas all distant cousins of Arthur Daly, but with a lot less tact. Slightest hint of rain and they tip you out their sun lounge to save them from getting wet, weird?Footpath or motorbike 'highway' broken up in many places and dangerous for pedestrians.....but what do you expect, after all it is Bali............stay by the pool in your hotel is safer and more hygienic.........."
yesdes,Melbourne,Jan 2015,What's with all the rubbish. I found it disturbing to take walks on. Really needs a good clean and those businesses need to take some responsibility.
clau1228,"Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2015,"I was expecting to find a great beach with amazing waves,but what I really found was a huge beach full of rubbish! It was so disgusting! We tried to walk along the beach but it was just impossible, of course we did not get into this terrible water, when the wave was about to break we saw all the rubbish grrrrr terrible!"

TravellingHegge,"Red Deer, Canada",Jan 2015,"I've been told it was because of the rainy season, and it's the rain that brings it all in. I was also told it was still left over from new years eve.

duckyjim,"Polmont, UK",Dec 2014,"I have never been to such a dirty beach in my life. I can understand that the logs/wood comes down from the hills during the monsoon BUT why cant they clean it up. The rubbish along the whole stretch of this beach was disgusting, don't know how many nappies we counted, tried to go swimming and the plastic bags just wrap around your legs. I thought Bali was a paradise location, how wrong I was. NEVER again"

When-on-me-travels,"Stoke-on-Trent, UK",Nov 2014,"Myself and a few friends got a taxi to the beach from our hotel and had a light meal and a few beers along the beach. The beach was clean where we were and the sunset was impressive.We were hassled every 5mins by people selling scarfs, jewellery, frisbees and the like but we still had a decent evening."
Tarlie,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Jan 2015,"Seminyak Beach was very disappointing, the beach is full of rubbish which is washed up everyday. In the afternoons you can see locals walking along the beach going through the rubbish, some were even taking dead fish!.  The surf is dirty and rough not fit for swimming. Be careful when walking along this beach that you dont stand on something! The hotels along the beach are stunning and they do try and clean the areas in front of their hotels daily but it just washes up again the next day, very disapointing and sad to see such a beautiful place littered."
John H,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2015,Don't forget to stay on at the beach for evening meals and entertainment - much to do on Seminyak beach in front of Double 6 Hotel
Sandy P,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,"Yep, if you're visiting during wet season there will be rubbish on the beach. This washes down from all the creeks and rivers not just in Bali but across the sea and sadly lands on the S.W. facing beaches between Dec - March due to the currents. If you visit at other times the beaches are quite lovely. Try Googling The Great Pacific Garbage patch for truly depressing garbage information that is being created by all of us each each and every day.There was a concerted effort during our recent stay to try and clean up the garbage and debris each day but this a mammoth task that also requires considerable resources.So you wont perhaps be enjoying moonlit walks on the beach but the sunsets remain quite stunning and the beach is still a quick and easy gateway to some incredible dining and drinks options. Or visit between April and November !"
207LisaF,Seattle,Jan 2015,"Our recent stay (Jan. 2015) featured a beach strewn with trash, and too much wind to make for good surf. However, I have fond memories of surfing here in previous years with very little trash on the beach."
RMM1234,"Rose Bay, Australia",Jan 2015,Pollution is a problem but great to see on sunset when all the kids play on the beach. Ignore the people hawking their goods.
Sharron501,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,We went for morning walks but there was heaps of rubbish and dog poop to dodge. It would have been a lovely walk if not for that.
Rudi888,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2015,"Problem is litter. Our stay at Anantara Hotel meant we saw beach every day. Hotel cleaned it up each day but there were still plies of debris, eg wood and rubbish in heaps on beach. When you look into the water there is rubbish by the myriad and I'm not exaggerating. Plastic cups, bags, toys, bottles etc etc The pictures of pristine Bali beaches in Seminyak are not accurate. "
Nadia A,"Dammam, Saudi Arabia",Jan 2015,"My family and I visited Seminyak Beach because it was within walking distance of the Courtyard Marriott, but we regretted it. There was trash everyone on the beach, mostly due to the rainy season and currents drawing the trash out and the waves returning it to the beach. The locals did try to clean it but it was pointless, really, as the ocean regurgitated it minutes later. Go to Jimbaran if you want to enjoy the beach."
BiaMonteiro78,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2015,"The beach was dirty, with all kinds of bottles, lighters, plastic, etc... on the sand.I didn't have the courage to go into the sea.If you want to enjoy good restaurants, bars, shops, beach clubs, then it's a good alternative, like Potato Head beach club, Ku de Ta, and several other restaurants, bars, shops, massage spas along the main street."
Thomwayn,Canada,Jan 2015,"If you visit Seminyak, you MUST catch at least one sunset on the beach! Be sure to arrive about 30 minutes-1 hour before sunset as it can get crowded and things happen quite quickly. I sat near the Potato Head Beach Club along the shore and watched as the sun quickly sank behind the clouds. The colours were indescribable and the view was breathtaking! So amazing! The lucky people who live and work there get a treat like that everyday. I went during low-season so it wasn't too crowded. I highly recommend Seminyak Beach if you're in Bali!"
Raffster58,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Despite the hard work of locals every day trying to clean up the waste and refuse, I have never on a daily basis seen a beach so dirty and disgusting and waste strewn from the water line right to the road. if you want a first hand picture of how we are destroying our planet and our environment, come to Seminyak beach. Dead rotting fish, dog faeces, plastic containers and an assortment of rubbish. What a real shame!"
567CAT,"Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia",Jan 2015,The beach was dirty and lots of dead fish on the shore they tried to  clean it up but then left piles of rubbish every where.
Forever an Islander,Philippines,Jan 2015,"As I've spent my whole life in SE Asia, I can say I have seen many filthy and ugly beaches but Kuta Beach beats them all. I was in Kuta during a stop over and I decided to walk to the beach...OMG...what a sad sight. There were mountains of rubbish and garbage accumulated on the shore at every 20 meters...With a terrible traffic and a heavily polluted road just a few steps away...I was shocked to find out that so many people actually do go to such an ugly place. Weird."
sandy f,"Mandurah, Australia",Jan 2015,"In front of Champlung Cafe look on the beach for Ruddy, Rocky,Made and Eka. They are the nicest people who a always give a reasonable price and will remember you next time.made has great silver rings and ruddy does a great deal on bangles and belts. tell them Sandy & Barry says hello from Perth"
Adam B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,It is sad to see such a splendid stretch of beach absolutely covered with rubbish. The rains wash out the drains resulting in a filthy deposit all the way down the coast - except where exclusive resorts or restaurants have paid cleaners to clear up! One of our party even saw schoolchildren participating in the cleanup WITHOUT gloves! Yuk. Don;t even think about swimming - the crest of each wave consists of floating plastic!
Lemario1976,"Townsville, Australia",Jan 2015,"Sewers discharging straight into the beach, mountains of garbage, dead carcasses of birds filled with plastics.... lost for words. We spent the days swimming in our hotel pool and went to the water parks, avoid at all costs as surely future visitors to Bali will begin doing in droves"
Subra01,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2015,The colours if the sky as the turn from blue to yellow to orange to deep red and finally dark was amazing as the sun set over this beach.For a off-season it was reasonably cordedHowever it wasn't as clean as Seminyak or as I expected
Annie M,Melbourne,Jan 2015,"the beach at Seminyak is disgusting,full of garbage and defiantly not clean.We swam at our Villa most of the time.As for sunset avoid the ""IN"" spots they are over priced and over rated"
Latoya V,19 contributions,Jan 2015,"It's cool to sit and have a drink after the sun goes down, because then you can't see the heavily-littered beach. It's really depressing to see that rubbish on the shore. :("
Mark M,3 contributions,Jan 2015,"It is an absolute tragedy what humans do to this planet. Seminyak beach is an example, with rubbish not only covering the beach but plenty in the water. If you like going for a swim at a rubbish dump then this is for you. The Indonesian people really need to wake up and start looking after one of their best assets. Tourists also need to remember to clean up after themselves! It's a shame, I wounder when people will change."
David B,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,"Filthy, smelly, terrible access. Very disappointed. Don't go to Bali for the beaches. Overrated and not worth it..."
DanChavo,"Madrid, Spain",Dec 2014,In december there were few people so that we have a lovely morning in the sea. The waves made funnier our stay at the beach. The weather was fantastic.
no bs yogi,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"The beach was covered in rubbish & the water was brown.  The sand was very grainy, it's appearance was greyish & it smelt terrible."
milletim,Kuala Lumpur,Jan 2015,Some of the most amazing sunsets you will ever witness in your life.  We made it a point to watch the sunset every night with a drink and just reflect on each wonderful day.
VTik,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2015,Pro :- Nice long beach.  Ocean view.  Pretty scenic.- Lots of restaurants and shops fronting the beach.Con :- It's a thrash heap during the rainy monsoon season (Dec/Jan) as the rain brings all the rubbish from the rivers to the beachside.... making it unsightly and smelly!
TaurangaDancer,Tauranga,Jan 2015,The beaches are beautiful but sadly covered in rubbish. There are masses of cafes and its lovely sitting on the beach but the swimming is not recommended- poluted. We ended up travelling to Uluwatu to swim
8mmSA,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jan 2015,"Apparently December is the Seminyak Beach, Trash Expo. An annual phenomenon where the currents bring in all our rubbish to this beach. Rubbish we humans failed at handling correctly . See the pictures... This place could be paradise, if we humans every cleaned up our act... but in Seminyak beach, I saw hell... Rather go to Nusa Dua beach, but please. I beg you, don't destroy this place too... Throw  your litter in the trash, not in the gutters and streets... Stop killing this beautiful country..."
Surfinghunty,West Sussex,Dec 2014,"Considering that the beauty of this place is the main asset, as a visitor, you are left in disbelief that the locals would allow this place to be spoilt by us.  We hired surfboards and had a good surf, but this was definitely affected by the plastic bags and waste that wrapped themselves around our legs as we battled out into the surf..!  If you choose to sit on the beach, then prepare yourself for one of the more committed examples of high-pressure selling that I have ever experienced, but I guess that goes with the territory.  In a nut shell, probably best to go somewhere else for an unspoilt experience."
Leontko,Singapore,Dec 2014,"This was a much better place to chill out than Kuta beach. A much smaller crowd here which equated to a more peaceful time at the beach. At the same time, there were enough people to give it a lively feel (not deserted). The waves here were pretty strong and surfing was difficult for a beginner like my friend and I. We were barely able to paddle out far enough to catch a wave without getting batted back (around the afternoon period). There were also cafes and bars littered around the beach (unlike Kuta, where you had to get out of the beach) thus, it was very convenient to just grab a bite or drink. Definitely a much better beach to visit than Kuta. "
Padraigmacroom,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Seminyak beach is a beautiful stretch of water with so every good restaurants along its shore including LaLucciola,Breeze and Ku DeTa. La Lucciola is probably the prettiest with great sea views and not much beach litter.As you walk back along the beach to main part of seminyak the beach litter bamboo poles and plastic litter is staggering. The water is unfit to swim in. It is equally dangerous for surfers with large pieces of wood floating or semi submerged which is really dangerous. Western facing beaches are subject to this after tropical storms with east coast beaches not affected as badly. The locals are trying really hard to control this pollution but much more needs to be done."
Joel,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2015,A more peaceful beach just a bit North of Kuta. Not too many hawkers and the beach seems a lot cleaner than the Legian/Kuta Beach area.
freedomwheels289,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"visited 6 or 7 of the beachside bars for relaxing sunset drinks, it was great way to spend several afternoons and amazingly the music , something as a couple in our 40's could listen too."
DoBeAdventure,"Peachland, Canada",Jan 2015,"The beauty of the beach is the length of it and accessibility. The downside....big downside, is the garbage on the beach every morning and worse after a rain. They do have a tractor with a pickup that is out during the day but it seems the garbage is never ending.  Very sad to experience.  On the positive, the beach bars are a great place to visit in the afternoon as they have entertainment daily during happy hour."
Denise K,"Lake Macquarie, Australia",Jan 2015,"The beach was filthy due to recent heavy rains and rubbish washed up, we weren't their for the beach though as we went Nusa Dua to have a lovely day at a clean beach!"
Margie F,"Kogarah, Australia",Jan 2015,"We had heard a lot about Seminyak prior to going to go to Bali, however the black was so disappointing. It was covered in pollution.  The rubbish was some of the worst I have ever seen on a beach anywhere in the world.  I would be very annoyed to have paid good money to stay at these great beachside hotels on,y to have this mess and smell out the front of the hotel. Stay away, head to Nusa Dua if you want somewhere in a nice hotel with a good Bea h out the front."
Dolphindream,"Byron Bay, Australia",Oct 2014,Great Walking and Surfing Beach - swimming only for experienced strong swimmers.Early Morning Walks along the Beach you get a sense of the Real Balinese way of Life before the Travellers wake up !
KDB888,"Ballarat, Australia",Jan 2015,"I walked from potato head to Ku De Ta and would sum up the experience simply by saying it is very sad. The beach is putrid with pollution- washed up debris, plastics etc. it is astonishing filthy, this being blamed on the rainy season and rubbish from the rivers. There was no one out swimming and one can only hope that there is a real clean up process and that it is much much better at other times of the year."
Daryl O,5 contributions,Nov 2014,"Great bean bags on the beach , cold beer, terrific mixture of cuisine and we love the hawkers for a bartering session."
Avinash N,"pune , india",Dec 2014,"I have been to Nusa dua ( All five star property beaches) Sanur ( For those who dont like to enter the sea, but want to see the sea) Kuta ( Surfers and Kids jumping around, + Crowded) amongst the most tourist friendly beaches . I vote for Seminyak beach as this has all that a true Beach Connoisseur wants.Quiet , Beach Chairs + Umbrella ( 25-30,000 ) per person per day if u bargain) cool beer , acceptable food like pizza or nasi goereng, fried rice) , soft sand , great waves and best views for Sunset.You can walk in the evening on the beach from your hotel in Seminayak to Kuta or Legian beach and cross over to the Party side and restaurants in Kuta . The walk is 40 min and has great views. "
Florian254,Norddeutschland,Nov 2014,"There is hotel afetr hotel and bar after bar at this beach so it is seldom empty. The public entrances are few and far between but worth going there in any case. Spectacular sunsets and nice (if very, very warm) sand. Lot´s of dealers walking along.For swimming basically forget it. I am an experienced swimmer and within 5 days I managed to get in only twice, the waves are very good for surfing but not for swimmers.And for all people not used to it: This red colour on somebody´s elses skin may be the same one as the one on yours. Be aware."
dip69,"Launceston, Australia",Jan 2015,"White sand? Where? The sand is grey and dirty. If you try wallk in the water you want to make sure you walk at least ankle deep or you will walk on bits of rubbish, including what looked like condoms and needle covers. You cannot take a decent beach walk because streams run across the beach into the sea and they are of very questionable cleanness so you don't really want to walk through them in case of catching some illness. As for the bars, if you want to sit in big groups of people sitting close together, this might be your scene.  I couldn't really see anything to rave about. There are much better places in bali than this."
sarafschroder3,"Columbus, OH",Jan 2015,This was by far the most disgusting beach I've ever seen. It literally looked like a garbage dump. The beach was covered in trash that had washed up from anywhere and everywhere. There are a few bars that are worth a visit where they've obviously cleaned up the sand but otherwise don't go. it has the potential to be amazing so hopefully it gets cleaned up. 
Gabi Borella,"Dee Why, Australia",Dec 2014,"Really dirty beach, but provides an amazing sunset! Grab a place at La Plancha and enjoy a couple of Bintangs and Croquetis while watching it!"
Adriankelly P,"Rockhampton, Australia",Jan 2015,was very disappointed with seminyak beach - if you looking for good beaches head to nusa dua or sanur areas it much nicer
Anthony B,"Cunderdin, Australia",Dec 2014,Some dayes the beach was fab but then other days you couldent moove on the beah becouse of the rubbish
Kerri S,Jakarta,Dec 2014,"Christmas and New Year are definitley a big hit in Seminyak, however don't expect clean beaches this time of year as the North winds bring in trash and wood from all over making it literally impossible to enjoy the beaches and the smell the garbage brings with it. September is a much better time to coem to these beaches"
Paul K,"Atlanta, GA",Jan 2015,"Great place to watch the fireworks, the people, dance, drink and ring in the new year.  Not the disco scene down by Kuta but very fun and more low key (but hardly quiet)."
SO1975,"Berlin, Germany",Dec 2014,"I love Bali, but please don't go there for the beach. They have to do something about the waste coming in and keep the beach clean as otherwise this will have an impact sooner or later."
Lyn M,12 contributions,Dec 2014,Seminyak beach has a great atmosphere and is not as busy as Kuta beach. Enjoyed sitting in one of the beach bungalow bars having an afternoon drink and watching the people go by. Lots of fun.
Huimineology,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"I visited in December, a week before Christmas and the beach wasn't filled with litters (maybe yet). The crowd generally sets in after 5pm, before that, the beach was less crowded and more serene. It was a rainy season but managed to catch the sunset on a good day. Street stalls are lined just outside the entrance to the beach, with the Satay tasting good."
josiewolff,3 contributions,Dec 2014,Debris washes up on the beach everyday you can't swim at the beach. Lovely beach but there is a lot of rubbish. They need to clean it up
Eoin C,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"Very nice beach with some hassles from people trying to sell you stuff non stop, although this is to be expected. The view is great so I recommend asking one of the locals selling beer if you can hire/borrow some chairs from them and then relax and enjoy the great service and cheap beer. The locals are very friendly and the beers go down a treat."
SooKen,Kuala Lumpur,Jan 2015,"I've been to beautiful Bali many times over the years but this is the first time I've seen such a shockingly filthy beach in all my beach holidays across Asia. It is such a sad state Bali is in and what tourism has done to it. Real drastic measures need to be taken urgently by the government, tourism industry and local communities to save the beaches of Bali."
Jen,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Good for surfing, but beach dirty. Drains going out into the sea is smelly. Great for a nice long walk or jog along the beach. Woudn't lay on the beach though. Gets windy. Dogs everywhere. Offerings scattered everywhere in the wind. "
read_e_2go,brisbane,Dec 2014,"The sunset was beautiful, but the litter on the beach is sad to witness - it has to be cleaned up daily by a tractor."
Maurice M,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,It is almost impossible to walk along the beach as you are literally wading thru tons of rubbish that is washed up each day - totally disgusting!!
Kathy C,"Amherst, NY",Jan 2015,"We went during rainy season, a lot of debris was on the beach and he water was so polluted we did t go in, we went to kuta beach also and. The same, tons of sand fleas, I got eaten alive."
tonyoneteam,"London, UK",Dec 2014,"Stayed at a hotel on the beach, love this breach, cleaned daily, lots of beds, bars at night and great for sunset walks."
Erika F,51 contributions,Jun 2014,"We were expecting a relaxing beach vacation in Seminyak before we headed inland into Ubud. Sadly, the beaches in this area are extremely touristy and dirty. There is a lot of trash on the beach. You will also get hassled by vendors trying to sell you things as well as women who will just go ahead and start touching you wanting you to pay for a massage. If you are looking to relax on the beach with a good book and not be interrupted, this is not the beach for you. There are many nice restaurants and cafe's along this beach and it is fun at night when they all bring out their bean bags to have a drink. I would suggest to venture south to more beautiful beaches!"
Swethashekar18,"Bangalore, Karnataka, India",Dec 2014,Good thing here is that they clean the shore everyday. Coz i am not aware of any beaches being cleaned any where i have visited.
Raitman,Port Moresby,Dec 2014,Really good surf and great beach for sunset watching. However there was no beach path you could follow
michelb-chantalv,Canada,Nov 2014,you will pay if you want to have a chair or sunbed for any length of time.many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach
Brent H,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2014,"At the time of year we travelled, December, the beach is pretty average - dark sand, rubbish everywhere from the monsoons and pretty average.. Not worth it, spend time at your villa!"
Shane Zieck,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Great location and always fun to be at but this time the rubbish washed onshore was so bad it rendered the beach as unusable. Still, we'll be back!"
Dean H,"Clarkson, Australia",Jan 2015,"Full of rubbish and debris and although they had tractors operating to clear it, they couldn't keep up with it, it is such a shame as it wasn't this bad when we visited before ."
Mick H,"Annandale, Australia",Jan 2015,This is my first time back in Bali in 20 years and I'm sad to say it's not changed for the better!The beach was litter strewn all along the 10 minute walk we took with large piles of garbage everywhere.  The government really need to do something about this if they are serious about tourism as I certainly won't be rushing back again!
Cee,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,"Watching the sun set is a must! It's beautiful, pictures will not do justice. Beach is a bit dirty with rubbish (there are people raking it up)"
GlennDias,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2014,"Crowded, dirty but entrtaining. Great lunch at Chez Gado Gado sitting out on their beach front terrace."
lozelizabeth87,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"It was pleasant. Water not ideal for swimming when hot as the oranisms in the water are unsafe. Nice for a cocktail, walk and tanning."
MichaelToose,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"i've been to Bali a few times, this my first in the wet. If you're coming for a beach holiday avoid this time of year as the beach is gross. Other times it has been fine.Still can't go wrong with a beer in the bean bags at sunset (when you can't see the trash)"
237nikkid,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"We first approached the beach at Seminyak with excitement and anticipation only to be greeted by rubbish littering the sand and a fear that we might step on something dangerous! I couldn't help but think that if this is supposed to be one of Bali's premier beaches someone has to do something about the garbage. There were small groups of Oberoi staff gathering trash into little piles but it was an impossible task.....and so disappointing! I know we are spoiled for beautiful beaches in Australia but if Bali tourism is to be sustainable into the future, something has yo be done about the rubbish, recycling and environmental care."
Phase N,7 contributions,Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are awful and this one is no different. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourists come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. There is also polluted water that seriously smells like sewerage flowing into the ocean and kids play in it!! I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are still pristine paradise so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc. I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer. This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person. All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions. These bars also seem to be populated with pretentious people staring at their smart devices and taking selfies particularly 'la Plancha'. You're better off buying some bin tangs and go further up where there are no bars and enjoy the sunset on a towel with some quiet."
DeeDee781,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2014,I liked all the restaurants along the beach.  There was a lot to choose from and well priced.  Harris hotel provided their own chairs
tutu_10,"Washington DC, DC",Dec 2014,"The beach was pretty to look at, the water was nice and warm, but some areas quite polluted.  The beach in front of Kudeta smelled a little of sewage runoff."
Glenn,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,This beach is clean and much more quiet than the beach at Kuta. We enjoyed the umbrella offered and the drinks served at the chairs provided
Robert T,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Dec 2014,This is a very good beach. Could be great. The town effluent that runs into the beach is one big downer. Pretty sure that raw sewage is in that effluent river that runs between the Oberoi and the lifeguard station then another just south of Luna2. Install a proper sewage system and change public dumping attitudes and this beach would be unforgettable. 
David K,"London, England, United Kingdom",Dec 2014,"Plastic, bottles, glass, crap in the sea and on the beach.  Even the bars that rely on the beach for income have thrown dud glass lightbulbs onto the beach. Rivers flowing into the sea smell of suplhur.  It needs huge effort now to make this a safe nice place to be.  Don't come."
Ari S,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"Bit dirty with a lot of rubbish on the beach. The only thing letting it down in my opinion. Surf was fine for me, but a bit for children"
Cheree N,"Greater Wellington, New Zealand",Nov 2014,"very busy, great sunsets, dirty around the edges and beware of constant beach hawkers selling all manner of stuff you dont need or want"
WillN55,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,"You have to try la Plancha's Friday evening sundowners on the beanbags! Best time for swimming, depending on tides, is early in the morning.  Be aware that the Balinese surf lifesavers have limited skills and resources.  Swim where you are in control, and between the red and yellow flags."
SRNMH,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2014,"I went there with my husband for honeymoon and stayed at Yubi Villa. We went to seminyal beach around 6pm to see the sunset. It was pretty nice view. It wasour first time there. We were standing in the middle of the sand and suddenly a normal wave came in and we taught it won't reach us. But shockingly, it reach to our knee level. The depth of the water is dangerous if you were to bring your small children.  Overall the place is awesome!"
Amanda J,"Geelong, Australia",Nov 2014,"okay, but as an Aussie not outstanding, not really my kind of beach, villa pool was better, cleaner and more relaxing"
Melissa R,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"relaxing and just beautiful at sunset, the locals we hospitable and entertaining also scored some good bargains from local vendors"
Jeremy055,"Cambridge, UK",Dec 2014,"Beach in December 2014 was awash with plastic and litter every day. It was disgusting. The water was full of plastic bags, labels and bottles. The litter is washed down from the hills in the rivers and much of it also comes from Java "
Bathawk,"Johannesburg , South Africa",Dec 2014,Unfortunately the beach becomes very dirty due the the trash washing in to the ocean when it rains. But on so he days it was very clean and a wonderful beach to spend the day on. Beach loungers are available for rent. Many restaurants are available .some surfing schools offer lessons.
Malta_explorer,"Bromley, UK",Dec 2014,Seminyak beach was probably the dirtys beach I've ever been to. It's a shame because the place has so much potential. But a stroll in the evening will bring you across lots of plastic and rubbish strewn all across the beach. I wouldn't go swimming there.
Bintang Soepoetro,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"i like it since it nearby to my hotel. Children loved it also. Although it was crowded, but the beach was clean"
rydawav01,"Los Angeles, California",Nov 2014,"Large, clean, you can rent surf or paddle boards anywhereLots of restaurants & shops on the water frontTry to avoid the solicitors on the beach"
NitinMit,"National Capital Territory of Delhi, India",Nov 2014,"Nice, crowded beach with lot of shacks. You can also do surfing here. Certainly not a quite beach if thats what you are looking for. Good beach for night walk as you can see the city lights that time. "
Mik W,"Croydon, UK",Dec 2014,"Its a good stretch of beach with some cool bars etc at the side where you can eat/drink on comfy seats under umbrellas but even though I saw people collecting litter there is rubbish strewn everywhere, with no bins to cut down on this, and the hawkers get on your nerves."
Lynley T,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2014,"I always enjoy a chilled Bintang on the beach at the bottom of Jl. Drupadi, so took a friends from L.A. to enjoy the sunset and general ambience.   Very disappointing compared to previous visits.   The beer wasn't chilled and when I told the 'beach boy', he just shrugged.   Not to be deterred, we took our beers to the ""Food Hut"" for the mandatory Sate's, which were excellent.However, when I went to pay the Bill they wanted to charge me for the beer TWICE!   I pointed out that we ordered on the Beach, but carried them up the stairs to finish with our meal.   One of the Waiters was adamant that he had given us a second beer with our meal.   The ""Cash desk"" checked the 'chits' and of course, we had only had 1 beer each.So, be aware...  "
Bernie Z,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2014,"I ve been for a jog in the morning around 6am. It was a ride between trash, plastic bags, flip flops... Tourist should come early to see that. Luck some truck clean that before most of the people arrive. A real shame."
Saakshi J,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2014,"Semniyak beach is full of life, with lots of beach facing bean bag joints having good food, drinks and live music. There are some vendors selling tatoos, cosmetics, trinklets, coconut water and offering massages. We walked from Semniyak beach to legian to kuta beach and Semniyak definitely seems cleaner and having better crowd, more limited to guests staying at beach properties. Kuta beach had lots of local people playing on the beach and stalls etc. so was much more crowded. Sea water is not that clean in Legian, Semniyak and Kuta. Waves are quite high but its still safe enough to go in the water waist deep or so... "
nagesh g,"Doha, Qatar",Feb 2014,Seminyak Beach is a beautiful white sandy beach...grt spot to surf & sunbath & if you wanna a cheap reflexology trust me its worth i after getting stressed on the beach
GlobalFrequentFlyer1,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,Beach was pretty dirty which is a shame. There are sun beds that you can rent for about $50K for 1 hour which is great. Swim between the flags... but there are not a lot of lifesavers...
AneliyaBG,"Sofia, Bulgaria",Sep 2014,"Beautiful beach :) Perfect for a walk, big and not crowded.When we went there the water came unexpectedly and take away my flip-flops from the sand, which were next to me - under the sun umbrella :DAfter 2 hours we had to walk 5 mins to get into the water. The waves has been so big. It's great for surfers, but watch out, because there were few broken surfboards.The sunset was the most beautiful I have ever seen. If you go there just for sunbathing don't miss it and wait to see it."
Birt1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,Too much rubbish on the beach - great to watch from a distance such as the Kudeta or Breeze Restaurant but up close not a patch on an Aussie beach.
YewMoon,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2014,"I'm not a beach person; I really prefer mountains anytime.  Still, if there's a beach I don't mind spending time at, it'd be Seminyak in the low season.It wasn't crowded but neither was it desolate.  You could relax (once you've made clear what you wanted and didn't want from the vendors) but there's always a pulsating beat somewhere to remind you of partying.And though none of the sunsets I saw was spectacular (it being cloudy in December), they were beautiful in their own ways."
diane cunningham,Edinburgh,Dec 2014,It's not the best beach in the world and could be cleaner though the hotels along it do clean up their bits but it's great for a refreshing breeze while walking in the sea to cool off. You can swim but the waves can be a bit strong.
JJ R,"Makati, Philippines",Dec 2014,"I like long walks on beaches and Seminyak Beach is a place for me.I like the feel of the wind in my face, the sand on my feet, and the sounds of the waves crashing in. Nice place for ""me time or my time alone"". Also nice to have friends to chat with.A definite place to visit more than once.The big plus factor is that the vendors are not aggressive and will not bother you once you say ""no"".  Go to this beach!"
MerryMegsy,"Lara, Australia",Nov 2014,Seminyak beach is the cool beach in Bali! Along the beach you'll find a heap of trendy restaurants and bars where you can lay back on a beach lounge/beanbag and enjoy the sunset.The sunset in Bali is just beautiful! And relaxing having a few drinks whilst watching the sunset was certainly a highlight for us!We also enjoyed walking along Seminyak beach during the day. We did not swim at the beach as our hotel was in Legian so we swam further down.
Bruno Wolf,"Villefranche-sur-Mer, France",Dec 2014,"This morning i walked on both directions of Seminyak beach and was truly shocked about so much dirt, trash, plastic bags and goblets, thousands of dead fish and dogs left overs etc.Nobody really seems to care that the people here cut of the tree they are sitting on !I have seen many beaches during my extensive travel life but this almost topped it all.If the authorities would take only one dollar from each arriving tourist per day for the purpose of environemental clean up, instead of the stupid airport tax, they could buy as many of the beach cleaning trucks as they need.The only clean parts of the beach were the ones managed by the more caring hotels. And even there, they had to clean it manually which is not so fun for the people that have to do it. There are not trash bins anywhere. I was reading a comment about the rituals on the beach and i actually saw one which was nice to see. But after i returned to that arey, the people had left with tue usual trash piles. Dreadful !They should remind themselves from time to time that tourists have choices and can spend their vacation and their money elsewhere very easily !"
Muhamad Hanif Asaari,"Subang Jaya, Malaysia",Nov 2014,Go here early in the morning. It was a beautiful beach to jog & not so crowded. you will definitely enjoy the morning breeze
Aleasha N,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2014,So much rubbish and dog poop everywhere.. plus all the people trying to sell you the same thing over and over.. yuck.  Guess i am spoilt for choice with Australian beaches..
Titzi09,"Newport Beach, CA",Dec 2014,The beach is fairly clean. We went for long walks every morning. The sunsets were beautiful. Along the beach there are many bars and restaurants so you have many choices for eating on the water.
Brooke D,34 contributions,Nov 2014,"A lot of trash on the beach, not the most pleasant of sights!  Could have been that it is the wet season, but even so!Didn't swim there, didn't feel the need!"
Melissahoworth,Indonesia,Dec 2014,I love this beach in fact we had our hen night and stag do in this beach! We always visit cristal palace. It sells amazing cocktails and the food they serve is pretty good. 
holidayjan,Brisbane,Nov 2014,"What a lovely place to relax at sunset with a Bintang beer, do not however buy from the beach sellers as I did and was hounded by all the rest of them there after. Lol"
traveldoc009,"Amritsar,",Nov 2014,"Its one of the finest stretch of beaches you see. A long picturesque beach with sufficient space for everyone to unwind. Its not crowded either. With lovely resorts in the background adding to its charm. The undercurrent is strong, so not for swimmers. Maintenance however could be better and some garbage can be seen around. Still its a piece of sheer beauty."
2010TheGoodLife,"Union City, CA",Dec 2014,"Good beach however hard to access as the beach is covered with hotels and restaurants that require you to access the beach by having to go through the restaurant. Vendors selling sunglasses, hats, necklaces, etc. on the beach along with a couple shops for surfboard rentals. "
IAN K,40 contributions,Oct 2014,"Lots of people go for the sunset so can get quite busy, food and drink stalls available. Bars close by become busier after sunset and many require a reservation."
Santeena D,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Getting toward the end of my holiday I booked into a hotel close to the beach.Walking along the beach in the morning staff set up umbrella's and lounge chairs, so colour full and people soon gathered.I walked  up the beach Ifound many bars/restaurants, all offering breakfast at good prices.People watching was fantastic, travelling alone it's amazing what you notice. around 5.30 I found myself down there for sunset.Staff had changed the lounge sun beds foe bright coloured bean bags, flage and lots of lighting was getting put up. I choose a spot and relaxed, great people all around, so much happening, dinner was great, picked a different one each night, same same but different ...  I would walk back up to my hotel maybe 10min and always felt safe. watching a sunset there at Seminyak beach I felt truly Blessed..."
sidakumar,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2014,"This is not a swimming beach. the surf in late november was rough and everywhere you see warning signs. not a chill-on-a-recliner, get drunk and take a dip kind of beach."
Amanda N,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,I have just returned from staying at Double-Six Hotel and I must say that I was so impressed that the beach had been cleaned up and free of all the rubbish that flooded it last year.  The restaurants are yummy and clean and the Bintag's always cold!  
Fran R,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"Beach was clean and easy to get 2,the traffic was some what scary when trying to cross road.The shops on eat street were amazing,so you always spent time checking out what was in store."
Di P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"You can't beat this place for sunset drinks, the staff are always helpful and the cocktails are yummy."
SharonChong,"Johor Bahru, Johor, Malaysia",Nov 2014,"i llove the view, and i love the dogs around there. It make it a most beautiful picture after all............................."
Mshohoho,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,Liked how it wasn't crowded at all on the weekdays. We had space to ourselves and it was peaceful. Sand was fine and water clear. Disliked how we had to pay to use a beach chair to park our things. Travel light. Bring a beach mat of your own.
B4r4cud4,"Clonakilty, Ireland",Oct 2014,"very nice beach tidy and big waves..nice food in a local beach restaurant..you can have a bed there for 50 000 Rp/day (3,5 euro) near the local famous bar."
DanJAie,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"Very nice beach, much much cleaner than Kuta, more peaceful established crowd and less pesky vendors"
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Plenty of water activities.  Bars and restaurants close by.  Clean, organised beach.The usual beach hawkers but they don't hassle you.  A polite no with a smile is all you need."
HaDWill,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Much better than the over rated Jurian Bay, Loved the laid back and relaxed vibe, great fun with kids"
Ella Dvornik,"London, UK",Nov 2014,Really pretty beach lots of bars and restaurants around...the sea is warm and sand I lovely. Lots of waves rolling in distance and amazing sunset. What can I say except heaven on earth... Sometimes ruined by screaming Australians.
Vicky S,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,They are grading the beach each day so was nice and clean.  They had flags to swim between if you are not a strong swimmer and the water was nice and clear.  The sand is a little grey but not unpleasant.
Channii,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Sep 2014,Nothing great was just like any other beach lots of people hassling you to come have a look at their stuff to buy
expat_brit_9,"Blairgowrie, UK",Nov 2014,"The surf here was good and safe for body boarding. The beach was clean and you could rent sun loungers off the local people for a reasonable price. They also rent boards and you buy extremely cheap beer from them. There are lots of sellers of sarongs, hats, watches etc, but most of them were not pushy!"
Alilen,"Damascus, Oregon",Nov 2014,"Warm gorgeous blue water. Shallow a long way out. While not the worst we've seen in our travels it is sad to see such a lovely beach with so much plastic and litter. ""Hawkers"" selling trinkets, ice cream, fruit etc were overall friendly. If you were not interested a simple but firm ""no thank you"" was sufficient. On average about 50,000 reps for beach chairs for 2 for two people the day. "
Maureen S,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"The beach was lovely but nothing out of the ordinary when compared to Australian beaches.  It was lovely to sit in the restaurant and watch the sunset, but would not go out of my way to swim there."
Nmdtech,Canada,Aug 2014,Plenty of space to walk and relax. beware of the waves though.at night the beach becomes a lounge. You'll see.
Chantal M,"Bangkok, Thailand",Nov 2014,"Great spot for sunsets, but not ideal for swimming, strong current. There are many hotels you can go sit and enjoy the view along the walk or street vendors have set up lounges for you to lie on for a price."
ClaireT410,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2014,"The beach has a breathtaking view of the sunset. It is a great place to relax. There are a lot of vendors approaching you trying to sell stuff, but they dont tag along once you refuse politely. A lot of restaurants along the beach are quite nice."
Achmad Maulana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"the seminyak as many people know as the luxury villa located close to the beach, offered luxury items sell along the street, as the place as well location  for many famous restaurant and resort, however many of the guest di di not know that the seminyak is the place for turtle sanctuary as the black sandy beach there are the home for green turtle nesting and sanctuary as well as laying their eggs"
Steve P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Wide expanses, great view and a few people but not much.. Hit the beach bars with music, bean bags and Bintang. Great service - you still get the odd sales person but who doesnt need a massage and hair braids"
Marty0010,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,"Hot, like everywhere. Plenty of places to sit and enjoy the heat if you are a sun lover. Beautiful sunset.  Then nightlife on the beach. Is a must- live duet and beanbags, toes in soft sand.  Love it!"
dg3225,"Seattle, WA",Nov 2014,"The beach is honky tonky but you know that if you are coming to this beach.  Lots of massage, and vendors always on top of you pushing their stuff.  Great food, night life is good and people are in great spirits here.  Just a fun place."
Ramburgers,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Nov 2014,All brown and yukky..didn't even go swimming...there were ppl annoying you to buy things everywhere and no signs or anything to show you where to exit the beach. Not good for kids at all.
Pamela J,"Durham, England, United Kingdom",Nov 2014,Beach was very clean and able to walk miles along the beach. Need shoes or flip flops as the sand gets red hot. Surfers paradise but difficult if you are not a good swimmer. The hotel has a life guard on duty and warning flags are displayed on the beach
Ben P,"Fishkill, NY",Jun 2014,"Basically there is Kuta to the south, Legian in the middle, and Seminyak beach to the north. Seminyak beach is the quiet one, although quiet is relative because in July/August it is also full of tourists. If you don't like crowded beach I suggest to visit in June like me, or September."
Barry A,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Nov 2014,"Good beach with lots of good quality cafes nearby for a snack or meal,  and great spot to watch the sunset and have a quiet drink. Locals seem to like it too."
Balloot,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,"Nice clean beach close to the major hotels/villas in Seminyak. Also, there are a fair number of dining options nearby. Chairs can be expensive, so make sure to negotiate them down, don't take the first offer. Surf is rough, but there is a lifeguard. There were lots of people in the water, but should be careful with children or inexperienced swimmers.Overall very good, but not the most picturesque beach, hence only 4 stars."
thedoctor4646,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,It was alot cooler on the beach and its nice to see families playing here and the sunset was lovely however its dirty and the water is unclean . We walked along the beach to get to Ku de Ta and had to walk across 2 wide creeks that reaked of effluent.
imgod2,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,"The Seafood is average tasting, nothing fantastic about it. Wear sandals and use a decent toilet before going there."
Blue_Man_Alejandro,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2014,The locals advised that Seminyak beach is a great place to catch the Bali sunset as compared to Kuta beach (if you have kids). It's just far less crowded and rowdy in Seminyak as compared to in Kuta. We went to Potato Head without reservations and couldn't get a table in time for the sunset so we gave that a miss and went to the beach instead. 
Ameniavella,Malta,Oct 2014,"It was beautiful, clean and the bars and restaurants scattered around contribute to the lovely atmosphere there!"
925archer,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"Beaches on the west coast tend to be quite rough and many had flags out saying swimming prohibited.  Lots of daybeds with umbrellas around to hire (about $2 or $3 AUS per day).  Beach sands were mainly volcanic, nice and dark."
EllenAndySoo,"Singapore River, Singapore",Oct 2014,Love to watch the sunset there!!! Indeed beautiful!!! And also can watch big waves!!! CAn go for surf!!!
Katerina K,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,"Beach is nice. The only thing I didn't like was the locals trying to sell u products. However, if you step on the green grass where the hotels are, they are not permitted to follow"
Jane B,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2014,Lovely looking out at the beach from local restaurants. Not too good for swimming due to strong rip.
monalizzahl,The Netherlands,Apr 2014,"I love Seminyak Beach <3. come often here just to watch the sunset, walking along the beach watching people riding horse (if ure lucky ;)). i love to spend my evening time in Seminyak beach and double six beach.."
Kazipooz,Benalla,Nov 2014,very nice to watch the sunset and have a few drinks in the bean bags. We just had pizza and drinks on the bean bags - service was excellent and didn't get bothered to much by sellers.
Sav01,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Nov 2014,Must have dinner on the beach in the bean bags for the sunset here and the locals don't bug you like they used to 
Trequier,"Hobart, Australia",Oct 2014,"We had a fantastic view to watch the sun setting from Chez Gado Gado, while enjoying a couple of cocktails and snacks.  We then walked along the beach and it was such a lovely spot, to see everyone was having a good time. "
Barneswallisred,"North Yorkshire, UK",Nov 2014,"To many dogs running around doing their business. Even witnessed a guy taking a dump on the beach!!! Broken glasses, broken bottles a plenty. Maybe somebody should invest some of the money taken on entry and get those beaches cleaned up."
adelaidegrega,"Richmond, Australia",Oct 2014,Had a great walk along the beach at sunset it was very romantic with my wife felt like we were 18 all over again.    ps (58)
milk77,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2013,"Used to stay at kuta area for 3-4times. It was my ist time staying near Seminyak area, beach was dirty and not many people. Guess i still prefer to stay at kuta area more fun."
barrywhitford,brighton england,Nov 2014,"go for sunset its amazing,The tide is quite strong at times and alot of surfers there,Many beach stalls for a cold beer"
Nick B,"Baltimore, MD",Oct 2014,Great to walk the beach day or night.....  Sand as far as you could walk...afternoon would get calm and you could swim comfortably.
Jade-cha,"Berlin, Germany",Nov 2014,"I have very fond memories of the place at night when my bf proposed to me there. Bali is beautiful, the people are nice and the beach adds a wonderful combination to it all."
Grant P,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2014,So much nicer than being hassled in Kuta on the beach front. Cleaner and better managed. Highly recommend
varun_ajmer,"Ajmer, India",Oct 2014,"great relaxing experience , not too touristy  but neither secluded.strong waves ( be ware of red flags)we enjoyed takings evening strolls there"
miu100,UK,Oct 2014,Beaches aren't very clean in Bali. This was the best I saw in a month of travel. Nice bars and beach clubs. 
mxdad026,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,Laid back communal beach that comes alive just before sunset when the warungs set up for the sunset.Casual seating with groovy background music.
Daonnydarwin,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2014,"We love to walk on the beach and we did everyday but the open drains spoil the walk, the smell is just a total turn off and we did not swim at all."
Foodie8668,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,Like the beach at Seminyak.  It is much lesser tourists and not as crowded as beach in Kuta for example!It is also clean and have a good stretch of nice beach with beautiful sand!  Love it!
Travel4yoga,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Apr 2014,The beach is crowded and a little dirty here. Don't leave items unattended. The hotels along the beach take care os their own beachfront - pay a little more to stay in one of these.
fionaclarew,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,The beach is NOT the highlight of Semiyak unless you enjoy raw sewage. There are a few activities and places to sunbathe but it is not an especially nice area-there are plenty of better beaches in Bali to visit. 
Fabster74,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2014,"Liked the sunsets, length of the beach. Disliked looking at the brown water and waste washing up! Also disliked the tenacious vendors trying to sell sarongs and sunglasses, but given how much the locals have to live on, it is understandable. "
torbstra,"Altona, Hamburg, Germany",Oct 2014,A really wonderful beach with white sand and very clean. A lot of beachbars around with good food and cold drinks. A paradise for surfer because great waves...i love it
Bruce,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2014,The hawkers get at you but that's ok. It's just not the nicest beach in Bali. Certainly not safe for younger children.
Jackie D,"Whakatane, New Zealand",Oct 2014,Walked along this beach and it was beautiful! Watch for areas that are used I believe for spiritual purposes and where swimming is not allowed! 
Kirk66,"Pakenham, Australia",Oct 2014,Great beach for a early morning walk or watching the sunset with a cocktail. A lot cleaner than I thought it would be. Great for surfing as well
Normac44,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,Long white sandy beach  and hot. standing on the beach you can see right back to the airport.Not so many beach vendors trying to sell stuff to you all the time.
Barbie B,"South Australia, Australia",Oct 2014,Loved this beach for the safe spot to swim and the amazing sunsets! Also convenient to walk to from our hotel in Seminyak!
cherylross2014,"Sydney, Australia",May 2014,"Ate at beachfront restaurants - superb seafood,  excellent Italian, and local specialties were far & away the most surprising thing about Bali"
Debra W,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,Loved walking along the beach in the mornings and viewing the sunset over the beach.Golf carts go between Double Six and The Breezes resort so good to use during the hot hours of the day.
davyb57,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Just returned from Seminyak and visited the beach on a few occasions. We found it very nice and great for a relaxing drink at sunset.Previous posters have commented that it was dirty. Yes the sand is sort of black but maybe that is it's natural hue. Dirty?......I'm not sure of that.In saying that, we were only there from sunset for a few hours, and found it lively and very relaxing."
John L,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Unclean, noisy, not what we would normally choose.  The surrounding establishments were very crowded and noisy."
DownunderLynn,26 contributions,Oct 2014,"Going to Bali was expecting a bit of paradise, didn't like the beach in Seminyak but had our own villa so bonus"
judithkendall1,kent,Oct 2014,We like to walk along the beach & paddle and this more than satisfied us.....places to stop for a drink...large waves so not for swimming but a few people surfing!
pandt2013,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach is dirty. Near black sand and brown water. We didn't go in the water for fear of getting sick. Beach is polluted with rubbish.  Not the White sand and clear water that we enjoy.  Make sure your accommodation has a good pool instead.  Or do a day trip to nusa dua or even better Dreamland.
BelMac,"Mount Macedon, Australia",Oct 2014,The beaches along the coast of Seminyak are between Legian and Canggu. They are wide with great surf and mostly whitish sand. Not much in comparison with Australian beaches but great for a walk. Be careful with swimming outside a patrolled area as the rips can be deadly. There are many beach merchants so be prepared. Also there are some Warungs further up the beach that provide cheap Balinese meals in a great atmosphere.  
Anabell,"Kastrup, Denmark",Oct 2014,I entered near the W hotel. I must admit I didn't go very far. To me it was not a beach where you lay down and sunbathe so was quickly of again
KMarth90,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"Great beach with lots of things to do and restaurants to eat at. It's also a bit quieter than Kuta. There are people constantly trying to sell you things, which can get annoying, but that's to be expected on a public beach. At night the beach side restaurants set up tables and bean bag chairs and there's also live music, it was great! "
abbottpotter,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Oct 2014,"Compared to the crowded Kuta beach, this beach is much better. The beach is quite peaceful, a nice place to stroll around or walk your dog. Might be a little crowded on the weekend since this is everyone's favorite place for jogging."
itefoster,"Rotherham, UK",Oct 2014,A lovely clean sandy beach that stretches for miles. If you love surfing then this is the beach fro you.
timfennis,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2014,"obviously a nice beach with plenty of places to chill, eat drink etc. Only thing that annoyed was the horrible 'pop/house' music that was played by every other beach venue. especially when having a hangover."
Brian108_11,"Belfast, UK",Oct 2014,Most of the best hotels and Restaurants back on to the beach which is really fantastic. They are clean with plenty of access points. You can access the beech from most of the hotels as the security officers don't mind
Hugo F,15 contributions,Sep 2014,"However the atmosphere is nice, nice hotels and restaurants, most private.  on Sundays afernoons is full os local people in a festive mood.  From time to time, if you are lucky you will see somehindu rituals by the beach."
Skye84,"Gosford, Australia",Oct 2014,"Love Seminyak beach for its sunsets, long walks, bean bag restaurants and merchants selling their wares. "
SweetKat,"Sitges, Spain",Oct 2014,"Good beach for surfing, not so much to swim. It is good if you're in a club as well KuDéTa enjoying the view and enjoying the sound of the sea. Good beach for walking."
HolidayHot,Melbourne Australia,Oct 2014,"Never ever have we seen so many empty toothpaste tubes (???!!!) on the beach... Surf was beautiful but makes the swimming difficult, best swimming in pools. One of the destinations were there is no boulevard along the beaches, from where to admire the sea view."
Cris H,2 contributions,Oct 2014,"I only gave three stars to the sea swimming in Seminyak beach as the waves are very powerful and the currents are extremely strong. They have flags to mark the ""safe"" swimming areas although there's no life guard in sight, and given the ferocity of the sea currents, you get easily dragged out to the unsafe areas. I'd suggest, no swimming at all or keep at the shallow area- and if you still want to go deeper anyway, be VERY careful, unless you are at very good swimmer. "
Hildyblues,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2014,"I was here mostly at the end of the day just before sunset and the first day the Red Flag was up for the rough seas.  The next day the sea was calmer but still if with children it is not really a calm sea for them to paddle in.  The ambience is really great at the sun sets, with all the restaurants setting out pouffs and sofas on the sand and as the sun sets, lanterns are lit and some restaurants haves plastic tables that illuminated and change colours, quite quirky but all setting a nice atmosphere.  Musicians perform at different restaurants and their songs mingle with the sound of the surf and carries along the beach.  Vendors of patios, bracelets, kites, shish as walk the beach but do not annoy you, when you refuse to buy.  The lights of the line of the coast can be seen and makes for a memorising evening."
skyhoosier,"Naples, FL",Sep 2014,"A beautiful wide beach down to the sea.  It's great for walking, catching some sun, or splashing through the water.  Not too many hawkers and they are generally well behaved. The water can be rough with some undertow, so one has to be careful, and pay attention to beach advisories."
MaseandLinke M,20 contributions,Oct 2014,"This beach is so much better than Kuta. Less beach hawkers and better bars/restaurants. Watching sunset, drink in hand, sitting in a bean bag whilst listening to music is just heaven."
England B,Singapore,Oct 2014,"Visited the beach around midday after deciding to walk down to Kuta. As we walked to the beach there were a number of open sewers running along the side of the back streets and when we got onto the beach one of them was running down the beach to the sea giving off an unbearable smell. We preserve only to find another runoff just 50m up the beach, again given a terrible smell. After that we gave up and decided it wasn't worth it. When you have such amazing beaches over at Sanur, why both with this one at all??That said, the place looked like it had great surf and apparently the sunset is good so on that basis I have to assume its worth a couple of stars, otherwise I'd have given it zero as the competition is much better"
pandainsingers,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2014,One of the longest and cleanest beaches we have seen. Big surf. Unspoilt. Not busy. Great fun. Saw a number of people jogging which made us feel very lazy!
Sophia S,2 contributions,Sep 2014,"Nice beach for walk, sunbathing and sunset with a glass of cocktail. It's not like Kuta beach, this beach is quite."
diamonds48,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,This is one of the best beaches to walk along enjoing the sea and to experience the beautiful sunset go and enjoy
Christopher S,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"The beach was a quick walk from our villa, we arrived around 4.30 and grabbed a seat to watch the sunset and have an early dinner. Plenty of places to eat and so so cheap. You will get bugged by people selling kites and watches."
Macy_love,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,"very busy at times but amazing sunsets, beautiful for a morning run, such a fun atmosphere and really good for swimming :)"
Patricia L,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach was less crowded than near Legian and Kuta. We slowly walked at the water's edge for under an hour to get to some restaurants in Legian. There were some good restaurants in Seminyak but we have our favourite in Legian.
Yasmina_a678,"Baku, Azerbaijan",Oct 2014,"Very nice but for surfer , very crowded but easy to find place Clean Dislike a lot of seller and nagging "
Devashish P,"Hong Kong, China",Oct 2014,Average Beach close to seminyak square a good shopping area with good Restaurants and Bars.Try Kuta beach for more Fun.
FledgeColac,"Glen Iris, Australia",Oct 2014,The beach is great to walk along but in most places the undertow is too strong for safe swimming. Although they clean the beach every morning there still seems to be a fair amount of rubbish.
Cruiserchick2248,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Oct 2014,"Not the best beach I have been but it is a patrolled beach with lifesavers, lots of bars and restaurants, the usual touts selling their wares, massages etc. go just before sunset for spectacular sunset photos."
ClaireF2239,"Chesterfield, UK",Sep 2014,"There are several smelly sewerage inlets into the sea which you have to paddle through as you walk down the beach. Beach sellers are persistent.Plenty of paid sun beds to use, clean sand, plenty of snack bars. Lots of places not suitable for swimming due to red flags."
Olly,"London, UK",Sep 2014,"While the sunsets are beautiful and the range of beach front bars and restaurants are great, the grey sand and violent waves (meaning swimming was prohibited while I was there) mean this is a fairly average beach for this part of the world. I have to add that I didn't see any of the litter many others had reported."
Russell4157,"Hervey Bay, Australia",Oct 2014,"Coming from Australia, the beach is ordinary at best.  The sand is coarse and the water a little turbid.  Have seen better in other countries."
Smeli_Meli,"Hobart, Australia",Sep 2014,"Many venues overlook seminyak beach allowing you a view to sunset from a location ideal to your tastes, be they food, wine, resort or night club."
LuisTacon,"Portonovo, Spain",Sep 2014,Very nice beach for tourists. You have many activities to do on the beach.Also the umbrellas and bed are cheap for the day.
knucklehead,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2014,This beautiful beach is less busy than Kuta or Legian beach. Great place for sunset. Surf and swim can be dangerous sometimes. Scary waves when I went there. Bargain for benches and massages!
DPrakoso,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2014,Way better and cleaner than Kuta. You will see the most attractive Indonesian girl here. You can lie down the air-sofa and enjoy your beer or coconut water. This is called a life.
Chris R,"London, UK",Sep 2014,"Not the most beautiful beach in the region, but a fantastic sea for surfers and larking about. A fair number of touts too."
ChrisPrice12345,"Karuizawa-machi, Japan",Mar 2014,"Don't get stressed by people selling things, they are just trying to make a living, massages are good.  Enjoy the buzz and people watching. Negotiate hard, but in the end, dont worry about it. Have fun. La Plancha is esp[ecially good in the evenings.  Obey the lifeguards / signs - the surf can be dangerous. Our neighbour died (drowned) off The Legion hotel beach"
KBattaloo,"Clarens, South Africa",Sep 2014,If you go to Seminyak you just have to experience a sunset on the beach and sit on the bean bags that go all along the beach. I had the best cocktails on the beach here. And could have sat there for hours!
carly g,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,This beach is beautiful if you want go on a quiet peaceful stroll. Go to kudeta and enjoy a cocktail watching the beautiful sunset. Absolutely amazing sunset.
Joanne F,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2014,Water was quite turbulent when we visited so I'm sure it looks prettier at other times. Hawkers parade in front of the beach bars selling their goods. Several good looking bars/restaurants offering good views.
rob b,"London, UK",Sep 2014,The beach was so lovely surfers paradise never felt pressed to buy the local goods but they are very lovely peopleWe saw many weddings and the security is very good
sozo12,"Los Angeles, CA",Sep 2014,"real beach scenenoisy, crowdedperfect for young at hearthard to walk abouttransportation system needs thinkingbit too chaotic"
Marmifero,"Lisbon, Portugal",Sep 2014,"Very nice smooth shelf great for walking and dwelling, but pollution everywhere from urban wastewater drainages across it extension. If you’re too much in the water you’ll get an ear infection or worse, which is a shame. It’s with a bitter taste that we realize how superb environments in Bali like Seminyak, especially in Southern areas, have been destroyed by pollution. Something definitely needs to be done to recover these areas."
Ian B,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,"Potato Head is one ...Ku De Ta is another place that is a must, especially at sunset, to eat, drink and take in a beautiful Bali sunset..."
Debbie4591,29 contributions,Jun 2014,"I love this beach! So clean and the sand is soft so I didn't have to worry about stepping on stones or broken shells. If you want to have a swim go there by 3 pm that way you get some sun cause once it is dark you won't be able to swim. The current is strong so be careful. After swimming you can go to any of the shacks on the beach. There's a whole strip of places to choose from. Seafood is really good. Each place has its own band and vibes so just walk around and see which you like best before selecting. We enjoyed 'Chiringuito'.There are a lot of hawkers that will sell you sarongs, bracelets etc. They are a bit annoying cause they come to you as soon as you sit at one of the shacks. Although they do have lovely stuff but you can get the same at a way cheaper rate in Padang Padang beach.Its more of a younger crowd at the beach and a few kids. Great place to chill and end your night."
Stephen O,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,"You cant go past this as a fantastic part of the beach to relax and enjoy the sun, the sunset or an evening meal.   Restaurants that sprawl out onto the sand with bean bags to match make an evening drink and a bite to eat a memorable experience.   This is what tropical holidays are supposed to be like ..."
mjck1945,"Siem Reap, Cambodia",Sep 2014,The chairs are involved for relaxingThe chairs for comfort and looking at the hot chicks despite my ageGood reasonable surf  but beware if women selling
Laura A,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2014,"Seminyak beach is a really long stretch of dark sand, so don't expect the postcard white sands.... It is a lovely place to visit, however, even without the white sands. Head to the part further south in the direction of legian (but try to avoid legian itself if you can) near to the royal beach resort.. Then hire a beach bed for around 15000 and relax- the day we went there were plenty of interesting people heading back and forth along the front but it wasn't busy, just right... In the evening there are pleasant enough bars set on the front if you fancy that too."
Sindy B,"Albuquerque, NM",Sep 2014,There are so many places to eat and sit and watch the sun set. No charge to use them just order food/drinks and they are cool. Colorful bean bags and umbrella chaise line the beach. Surf schools available right on site. 
fnqfamily,Australia,Sep 2014,"Make sure you hit the beach before sunset, they are amazing. We enjoyed watching the waves crashing and the odd surfer too. Beach front bars were very popular at that time of day."
Mark A,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,Not a great swimming beach. Seminak sewage flows down hill to the beach. I didn't see anyone in the water (except someone with Bali Belly). Also the main beach is a religious area that forbits swimming.
Kylie T,"Doncaster, Australia",Sep 2014,"Great waves, felt save. Lots of families. Food in Seminyak is generally terrific. We ate a lot! Missed the massages due to lack of time but will return to do it again for sure"
CarolinaBetancur,"Canberra, Australia",Oct 2013,Seminyak beach is one of the most popular beaches in Bali. I loved the sunset there!! The nice atmosphere and the local food is good.
Anji J,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2014,"There are alot of little bars run by locals along the beach but look out for ""Molly's Bar' (almost directly infront of the Hard Rock Cafe), Molly is a dog the bar is named after - great owners! Very Friendly"
Lucas D,"England, UK",Jul 2014,"I like the beach since not to many person come to theis beach area, you still may jow the view, have fun with friends, playing the sand and look the beautiful wave at the ocean."
Mary_AnnC_11,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jun 2014,Relaxed fresh food with the company of locals who aim to please time to relax and spend a dollar or two with the beach traders
Sally H,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Sep 2014,the hawkers were polite and not too in your face.  The kids got their henna tattoos and hair braided and the people that did it were lovely.  loved watching the sunset on the beach
dicknick22,"Cathedral City, CA",Sep 2014,"great beach but bargin for chairs w umbrella.. I paid 80,000 they started at 200,000. gado gado restaurant is at the beach ..great but expensive."
DebbieGeelong,"Geelong, Australia",Jun 2014,Great place for the wedding photos whilst the sun was setting. We all gathered here to watch all the activities happening on the beach  and to revel in the tranquility of the waves rolling in. At that time it wasn't too crowded. 
Robost,"Prague, Czech Republic",Jul 2014,"the best here is to walk, relax, enjoy. and you may find a lot of interesting places from the beach: temples, beach clubs like Potato Head or KuDeTa, restaurants. the stilish side of Bali"
Brian W,"Loxton, Australia",Oct 2013,just the peaceful atmosphere and friendly locals and how close to the hotel was just a few steps away 
Maggie H,Sydney,Sep 2014,"For Aussies, Bali beaches are pretty mediocre. Costs a small fortune to sit on a recliner and constantly harrassed by the poor sarong ladies."
Easygoingtrev,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,Was great to have locals looking after tourists bringing out drinks making sure your enjoying yourselves.
Susan R,6 contributions,Sep 2014,Lots of smelly sections to Seminyak beach so choose which place you sit carefully so you are sunbaking under the waft of sewerage
Morganleee,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Oct 2013,"the beaches in siminyak were amazing!, i absolutly loved them!,the only down side of the beaches is the beggers and the people trying to sell you items when you trying to relax and eat your meal!, but other then that, its was a beauty to our trip."
Bogwog68,"Arthurs Seat, Australia",Sep 2014,"Head down an hour or so before sunset and enjoy the show. Head down to the right find a bean bag, order a drink and some snacks and the rest is easy. "
smartcookie50,"surrey, england",Sep 2014,Ocean was great for surfing market hawkers abound but you to need to barter to get a bargain. Grab a bed and relax
William C,5 contributions,Sep 2014,"Good waves, beach kind to your feet not loike in Europe, water temp good.  Not too cold.  Water not as clear as I like but waves consistent and good.Plenty of eating houses and you can buy just about anything on the beach.Great spot to visit...."
MargetBrisbane,Brisbane,Sep 2014,Quite a few hawkers which was off putting. Darker sand not so nice and the beach was pretty crowded.
Traceeey,"Wellington, New Zealand",Sep 2014,too many people trying to sell you things and too many stray dogs. Its a beautiful beach but these things put us off
Scott Berry,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2014,Nice place to relax on a deck chair and have on of the beach boys look after all your needs and get you beers as well.
Kevin M,3 contributions,Sep 2014,"Couldn't figure out why so many foreigners (mostly Aussies) flocked to a beach so dirty and stinky.  Yes, there was surfing waves, but it wasn't of any quality."
erbr63,"Rapperswil, Switzerland",Sep 2014,"We were walking up and down the beach several times with great joy during our 2 week vacation. With high tide and low tide.  Great spot for sunsets, but not ideal for swimming, strong current. great for surfing, has plenty of bars and coffee shops for resting along the beach and lovely in the evening too.  Prices for beach chair ridiculous...  Beach was reasonably clean."
wobbly2014,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,No tide and flat for walking also good surfing. If your fit you can walk from double six to potatoe head and kuta along beach
Henrique G,"Lisbon, Portugal",Oct 2013,"Gente people, Nice restaurants,good shopping. Confortable villas and spas. Easy and unexpensive transportation"
Niels W,17 contributions,Jun 2014,"seminyak has a nice beach with a lot of colours. also for surfing it is better than kuta beach (especially in the mornings), cause kuta beach is just too crowded in the water..."
Kate S,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2014,Always packed with people and sand is black and dirty. No direction as to which part of the beach belongs to the hotel as the private beach is not easy to identify 
Kirsty W,"Canberra, Australia",Sep 2014,"The beach was pretty, had black sand mixed in with the white, was pretty clean. I only saw two pieces of rubbish among the half a km I walked. You can't sun bake in certain areas because they are sacred so look for the signs. There are many hotels you can go sit and enjoy the view along the walk or street venders have set up lounges for you to lie on for a price. You do get hassled by the locals a fair bit to buy their wares but they aren't too pushy. The water however was rough as guts, as an experienced swimmer I had difficulty going out further than my waist the waves were strong and they were churning up a lot of sand. The beach is patrolled by lifeguards."
Mandzolive,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Seminyak's beach has black sand, its quite rough so not good for people who aren't confident swimmers.Kuta beach is better for swimming and spending the day."
Katie F,"New York City, NY",Sep 2014,"The sand and beach aren't the best in Bali, but the sunsets are best and it's easy to learn to surf. Recommend paying for the chair/umbrella for the day and/or hanging out at one of the many beach bars to watch the sunset. Also, many options for surfing rentals and lessons. "
susiebeer,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"The music the restaurants  the water, the bean bags  the sun going down.Food quite good few people selling stuff  nice watching the surfers and big waves."
Sez0816,"Fort Lauderdale, FL",Aug 2014,"Well, I love beaches so it's hard to disappoint.  Very nice beach - you can rent a lounge chair for pretty cheap and truly enjoy the crashing waves.  Various restaurants scattered along the shore to enjoy a drink or food as well."
Mark S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,great water but watch the waves as they can be very roughnice to walk along in morning and eveningwater is clean and warm
Joe L,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Seminyak beach, is not very good for swimming due to the large waves rolling in, however great for surfing, and the sand is course and brown."
JimmyKL,"Langkawi, Malaysia",Sep 2014,Best place to catch the sunset.  Watching the people walking beatmhing the fresh air...Lots of activities happening  .... the place to be
balibound88,"Pinjarra, Australia",Oct 2013,"the beach at seminyak just supurb on sunset, walk towards kuta and checkout all the cafes and hotels,quiet, no wind everybody happy lovely"
ASparrow,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"We did a little of wave chasing and kite flying during the sunset and that was just awesome!I was in awe of the gorgeous sunset, the black sand and the gigantic waves.During our stay in Seminyak Beach Resort, there was a rare occasion of releasing the baby turtles. That was one of our trip highlights and once in a lifetime experience."
maguscanook,"Toronto, Canada",Sep 2014,"Walking hand in hand with a loved one on this clean, wide beach are treasured moments for sure. We stayed at the Seminyak so it was easy to stroll down after breakfast and work off some of those calories! Sunsets are the reason to rave over this view/location though. Spectacular!!"
Herza,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2014,20 min walk to seminyak beach from Seminyak Square.Better than Kuta Beach but lack of restaurant/cafe
wayne d,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,"i understand the need for money but every 5-10 minutes people touching you trying to give massage or sell something you can never relax you have to say no several times,no good for relaxing or privacy"
Mala4050,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,first of all I don't like dark sand as it looks dirty but here it didn't help that it smelled badly as well 
JMF62,"Albury, Australia",Sep 2014,"The bars are relaxed and sitting on a bean bag or day bed having a cocktail a the Bali sunsets is amazing. Cool music and DJ's v casual and friendly, Be nice and firm with the sellers and they'll show you respect and leave you in peace or engage with them and shop as you sit and relax, either way great fun."
Xquisiterequisite,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2014,Beautiful beach with huge waves. We loved walking along this beach everyday during our trip.When the tide gets low the sand has a reflective glow and it is quite an amazing sight to behold. The sunsets were beautiful too. Most importantly there aren't any annoyingly persistent touts and vendors like what I've experienced in Kuta before. 
Rudi H,19 contributions,Oct 2013,"We are a family who loving to visit Bali. We have visited Bali for three times. The reason why my family love Bali because Bali has many interesting beaches such as Kuta, Legian, Dream land, Sanur and Seminyak. Beaches at south Bali have location are not far from the airport. Seminyak beach has amazing view especially when sunset moment."
everwindingroad,"Oakland, CA",Jun 2014,"I loved the mix of soft beige sand, with the soft black ash… it created what I am calling tiger sand.  The beach is lined up with lounge chairs that you rent from the locals.  We found a spot in front of a cafe with awesome coffee, liquor selections, and smoothies so we were set for a whole day of relaxing at the beach.  Even better, this cafe had Wi-Fi, so we could be sending photos to friends and making everyone jealous.  We tried to get in some surf classes, but the swells were pretty high and we were beginners, so we sat on the loungers all day.  Vendors are non-stop bombarding you with wares that they sell to tourists for a high price. Knowing this, I still ended up buying something for more than normal because he made me feel like I would bring him some luck for the day.  We did walk the beach at a certain point after getting board of sitting out.  Beware of the streams of water flowing out to the ocean, I don' know what it is, but I don't trust it.  Also, be aware some beach area is on temple grounds so no one can lay out on it- its pretty obvious where those areas are."
siamsabu2014,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,Liked this beach but prefer double six..beware of people selling their wares as they tend to be very pushy but just let them politely know you're not interested and they'll usually leave you be..
Peter R,"Bangkok, Thailand",Sep 2014,Surf can be a bit dangerous & sand is a bit dirty however there are a lot of places that have deck chairs bean bags etc  & food & beverages can be ordered wilst lapping up the sun
Dan_S,"London, UK",Mar 2014,"Very strong waves meaning unable to swim freely. The beach itself was quite vast but fairly littered with debris (although in fairness, the locals made constant efforts to remove the washed up rubbish). A quiet beach though with sufficient peace to relax."
Joy S,"Lincoln, UK",Aug 2014,"Coming from England but living in Australia, this beach fits somewhere in the middle.The sand is not white but more grey, and there didn't seem to be much ""dry sand"".There was plenty of sunbed (for a fee) and lots and lots of balinese people trying to sell you things. They can be pushy and annoying, but all you have to do is say no. We noticed one guy making fresh cocktails for people so maybe you wouldn't want to turn this one down!The most beautiful thing about this beach were the waves, i've never seen anything like it before. Waves starting from so far back, it was so mesmerizing to watch."
Helena R,London,Aug 2014,Not good for sunbathing in tranquility but big open beach and great for beach combing and fantastic for sunset
Excursionista14,Philippines,Aug 2014,"Seminyak Beach is a wide stretch of beach, and is not as crowded as, say, Kuta Beach.There's also plenty of restaurants by the beach - perfect for sunset viewing."
ggabi,Romania,Aug 2014,"There is nothing wrong to this beach, but my expectations were much higher. I found a regular beach with nothing that really impressed me."
Edward I,"Edinburgh, UK",Aug 2014,Very clean and not as busy as nearby Kuta.  There is a strong current and big waves which are ideal for surfers but maybe keep your eye on kids or those who are not strong swimmers
Gartigot,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2014,"I have to say that surfing there is awesome, as the breaks are big and you have a great time. Also the bars and cafes around are allright. on the other hand, the beach sometimes smells bad and there is some garbage around, homeless dogs also wonder around. If you are looking for good surf that's the place, but don't expect crystaline water and sand."
Diana J,Sydney,Aug 2014,"Like most beaches in Bali, it's dirty. Sand is black and full of rubbish and the water is the same. Didn't swim, only went in the water at our villa"
Johnypappa,2 contributions,Aug 2014,"bustling beach with loads of shacks and restaurants to choose from, sit and relax. Great food and loved Bintang beer.Mostly clean beach considering the foot fall. "
Somyakh,"London, UK",Oct 2013,"Good to spend some time. We saw lot of activities going around, lot of families playing together. It was good to see so much happening, with the cool wind at the sunset. Though we found some places with litter. But this beach is busy with many shops, many hotels and restaurant by its sides. In short, I would love to go again. The feel of the place is amazing."
Cubix F,"Bridgend, UK",Aug 2014,Long long long beach. Great sand. We found it very clean. The waves are big so pay attention to the flags and guards. There are sellers on the beach but there are all over the world and they are no problem.
Lisa O,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2014,"Endless white sand,great surf.hawkers and sellers are very annoying.dogs allowed on beach and poo in the sand.my husband put his elbow in some,yuk.rips very strong so be very careful.not suitable for kids un acompanied."
kawuwung,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2013,Waves up on the beach. Nice to play water with family. Surrounding many stores which selling clothes - beach clothing and souvenirs of Bali. Many expensive or cheap hotel near the beach.
PLC,"Purley, UK",Aug 2014,"If entering by the temple, then choose the path by the square, not the alleyway, as there is waste water being drained from the hotel(?) straight onto the beach and into the sea water and you will have to walk through it to get to the quieter part of the beach.  If entering by the square, take a left when you reach the beach as you will not experience the pungent smells from the waste water being blown in the wrong direction.If hiring a lounge, don't pay more than 20000rph per person for a few hours.Stay until sunset - worth waiting for!"
KezOz,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"Such a wonderful area to spend a couple of hours enjoying the sunset and a few drinks, sitting on bean bags under beach umbrellas.  Loved the experience"
Suzie H,10 contributions,Aug 2014,"The beach was very nice,just to get away from The hotel pool. Lots of people wanting to sell u goods,if u dont want to buy just tell them ur not interested. Lots of bargains if u like haggling "
Steve V,"London, United Kingdom",Aug 2014,"A massive stretch of sand with a gentle gradient into the sea, lots of people surfing but not great for a swim.  The hawkers on the beach become very wearing after a while as can't read a book or relax without someone trying to sell you something for more than about 10 minutes.  Great place for a sunset but as are the number of bars and restaurants which overlook the beach and you can get a drink in these and not be hassled.  A bit of little but seen much worse!"
SurbhiGoyal,10 contributions,Jul 2014,"This is a good beach for surf boarding and boogie boarding. Waves are high and give good momentum for a nice surf boarding experience. You will find many expert surfers riding on the waves. You will need to rent boards and seats. We had paid 100,000 rupiah for 2 hours for 2 boogie boards and 2 seats (got this rate after a bit of negotiation). Also, if you come by bike, make sure to park your bike near to the area where beach is flatter and people are surfing. We had parked our bike closer to the area where resorts are located and beaches are steeper. And it was a long walk back (especially tiresome after the surf boarding session). Don't forget to carry a sunscreen!"
Dheatherh,"Lakewood, New Jersey",Feb 2014,Cannot visit Seminyak without going down to the beach to watch the fantastic sunset andEnjoy food from one of the many venders.  A most enjoyable experience.
andreaSlovenia,slovenia,Jun 2014,"Our first beach in Bali, we loved its relaxed atmosphere, especially late afternoon. We enjoyed having a drink in beach warungs, laying in beanbags, watching people, sunset, the waves... our little daughter was running around, playing with other kids, enjoying the sand. It was perfect for the three of us. During the day was good ok, but a little difficult for small kids being in big waves."
Procidani,Melbourne,Aug 2014,"Come to Seminyak beach for a sunset.  Get here before 5pm and choose one of the many beach bars to plonk yourself down on one of the colorful beanbags, order some tapas and a Bintang and listen to trendy music while the sun goes down.  Bali sunsets never fail to disappoint."
Gerard Payne,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Loved the beach warungs cold beer at sunset , disliked the drunk Aussies drinking longnecks . 5,000 , maybe 10,000 people stretching from nth seminyak to kuta , watching the sun drop over the ocean with warm breezes , beats winter in Sydney ."
PortLincolnYHA,"Port Lincoln, Australia",Aug 2014,We walked along the beach to Legian everyday was great! We did not swim in the sea as it was a bit rough.
Will B,"San Rafael, CA",May 2014,"Went specifically for the sunset - and it was spectacular!  While the beach and bars were pretty packed, it still felt like fun!"
Milleben,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jul 2014,"it's a wild beautiful beach, we went there every night just to se the beautiful sunset. it's also a good place to surf :) (and to learn have to surf)"
IreneHorne,"Kangaroo Island, Australia",Aug 2014,Great place to unwind in the many resorts along the beachUnfortunately cant swim there as beach is rather dirty
Zachary Parore,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2014,"I was disappointed by the beach at Seminyak.  Strong rip tide, Trash and an Algae bloom at the shoreline didn't make for good swimming or an enjoyable time at the beach.  Coarse grey sand isn't really my thing either. I do recommend visiting any number of the beach clubs along the beach such as Ku De Ta and Potato Head. There are a lot of nice resorts on the waterfront, but I cannot recommend that you spent too much time on the beach itself.The area of Seminyak was a great place to stay, and I would stay there again.  Having been to so many other beaches in South East Asia, I was disappointed - my expectations were unrealistic.If you like white Sandy beaches, try out Nusa Dua, or even the pristine ones out by Jimbaran or Ungasan."
glenn t,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,just a beach with surf breaks. the sand is a dirty brown color not white or golden.. also come when the currents are running the wrong way and you may as well try swimming at the local tip
Graciousme29,21 contributions,Aug 2014,I will not return to this beach. If it weren't for the accommodation I would have left earlier.The beach is covered in litter. The noise from the big bars is annoying and I could not enjoy my walk because I just saw one after the other white fat burnt tourist bargaining over $1.00 for sarongs and other cheap & nasty tourist crap. Then there is the ever present G4S security circling the bars making me feel unsafe. Never again.
chelsren18,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2014,"Average type beach, Personally i would perfer Kuat beach although Seminyak is alot quieter it is alot dirtier with rubbish and broken glass frequently seen along the beach/waters edge. So manhy rips formed it was unsafe to swim the whole time we were there (1 week) Make the effort and vsiit nusa dua beach if your looking for the 5 star beaches in bali or always try Kuta beach and find a qutei becach bar top enjoy a few cold bevys."
Coenen H,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2014,"Very excellent beach with white sands, clean and only 30 minutes from Kuta. Location always be traffic jam on midday.All expensive in Seminyak. We rent 4 beach seats for 400K IDR with hard bargain to local man but he's very take care of us. Many small restaurants and bars surrounding beach, also hotels, shopping centres and spa services.Really made us relax for sleeping and swimming on Seminyak beach."
Edmond C,"Bellagio, Italy",Aug 2014,"We love the soft sand and long beach. Walking along it feels great. If you get a spot in front of happening clubs, you can enjoy great music with sea breeze"
Tracy C,"London, UK",Aug 2014,"Just had two weeks here. Great for couples, it's quiet and has a beautiful infinity pool overlooking the beach. Strong waves on seminyak beach so great for body boarding and surfing. Or watching those who do. Really pays to get a beach view room and certainly the room we had was very beautiful. The staff above all make this place, they could not be warmer, friendlier or more professional. The location close to the 'Oberoi strip' made this perfect for us. Just a quick walk and you are in the melee of every possible restaurant, bar and shops. Very busy but a nice contrast to the calmness of the hotel. Try to avoid rooms close to Ku De Ta next door as they do have very loud DJ parties. Our only surprise was a lack of a bar to go to in the evening. Sometimes we wanted to come back to the hotel in the evening and have a drink. Really surprised they don't have one. They do put on nice dinner evenings but they seemed to be not overly patronised. Their food is very good though,excellent chefs, even for the poolside snacks. However, for a quiet, romantic couples hotel (this was our honeymoon), we absolutely loved our stay and would definitely recommend "
Jenny M,2 contributions,Aug 2014,"great beach, lots of seating and good bars close by...................................................."
Steve G,"Camberley, UK",Aug 2014,Much quieter and more relaxing than Legian's beach and a million times better than Kuta's. Sanur is still the best unless you can afford the scary prices of Nusa Dua hotels.
sightseeoz,australia,Aug 2014,I live in a part of the world with the best beaches and found the dark gritty sand plus the fact I was unable to avoid walking through drain muck I found vey  unappealling in Seminyak. Getting to the beach was  difficult as they have used every bit of the prime real estate to build on. Suggest going to Potatoe Head with infinity pool overlooking ocean. If you don't mind the music.
Owen R,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,"Clean beach and great for a morning swim before most of the tourists are awake.  Plenty of bars to check-out for sunset drinks too.  Short walk north to Potato Head Beach Club, Ku De Ta, and beachfront hotels."
J S,23 contributions,Aug 2014,"Of course this place is not a secluded beach in the middle of nowhere but one of the busiest beaches in Bali. However, it is still clean and good for swimming, surfing, tanning and watching the sun set."
Lauren S,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2014,Grab a lounger for a fee or put your towel on the sand for free.  Beach is nice and wide and not crowded compared to European beaches (although those of us from NZ or Aus might find it a bit busier than we prefer!).  Beware of strong undercurrents and keep within your depth - there are lifeguards but not everywhere.  Good beginner surfing waves
greentravelwriter,"Paris, France",Aug 2014,"Come here for the experience of watching the sunset on colorful bean bags with hundreds of other people, and for some decent swimming when conditions are not too rough. However the beach can be pretty annoying too with a lot of commercialization and pollution ... "
Paul Douglass,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2014,I was disappointed with the quality of the beach after hearing so much about it…if you can overlook the countless stray dogs and plastic bags and the ungodly odour then I guess you could say its okay. Personally the black volcanic sands don't sit well…nor does the effluent running into the swimming water…needless to say i didn't go for a swim at this beach this trip.
123eaze,"Berkeley, California",Aug 2014,"The beach in Seminyak tended to be crowded in spots, but it is a nice beach for walking and for dipping into the water.  One really can't swim there because of dangerous rip tides.  I was surprised that the supposedly white sand was the color of dirt and not the white sand I have found at other beaches.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed being on the beach. "

Stephen C,"Victoria, Australia",Jul 2014,cleanliness the team on beach selling lounges and umbrellas very polite felt safe on the beach with lifeguards
Ibadanboy,"Nairobi, Kenya",Aug 2014,"Seminyak Beach is a very nice beach in Bali. Great to walk along - you can walk down to Kuta and for stunning sunsets since it is on the West side of the island. Housing many numerous hotels, restaurants and bars, Seminyak is somewhat more sophisticated than its sister Kuta. It has a decent stretch of whitish sand, and the water is okay. Currents could also be strong so be careful when you swim in here and respect all instructions from lifeguards and the hotel staff. Cool beach to hang out on and watch the surfers do  their thing."
Supacarl,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2014,"There is a sewerage outlet lagoon at the beach which smells really bad at this point, the rest is what you would expect from an ordinary beach anywhere else in the world."
Martin S,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Aug 2014,The beach stretch about 3 miles with soft dark sand. Its very crowded because we came in holiday season. There is many cafe along the beach.

kate a,Spain,Jul 2014,Me and my wife after touring stop at Seminyak beach to see the sunset.a very memorable time with my friends enjoying the sunset view on the beach of Seminyak.
Anish G,"Doha, Qatar",Jul 2014,"As we came into the beach area, we could see red flags i.e. strong current signs at various intervals...it was 9am in morning and there was a good cool breeze and chilly water...Beach was fabulous and the strong waves encouraged me to try Surfing for the first time. I couldn't balance much in 2-3 hrs of time, but really enjoyed the strong waves and fabulous surfing type experience...My son, was engrossed all time with the waves and dark sand mountains...If you are not in surfing, just relax, enjoy the quiteness and view one of the strong wave beaches in Bali..the strong Indian ocean wavesHighly recommended if you are in Kuta areaJust take care when you rent a seat / place to sit...check that the person has water supply working...else you will feel a shock with salty water sticking your body and far away places to wash it down ..."
Annyta P,"Corrigin, Australia",Feb 2014,"It was really windy the day we went there, there had also been big event of some sort. I found the beach to be pretty dirty looking and  the water the same. I would not have swam in it."
kaiki83,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2014,"I liked how it had less people but the beach was still pretty much lie Kuta, the floor of the beach is quite high so even non-swimmers can enjoy the waves."

Paul L,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2014,"This is a surfing beach with big waves, but for those that don't surf it's a gray beach to play in the waves"
helenford,"Auckland, New Zealand",Dec 2013,We chose Seminyak as we read it was a more upmarket area than Kuta etcHowever we didn't think much of the beachA few mangy dogs and no one around muchIn fact Seminyak didn't impress We loved our Resort but the infrastructure was worse than Kuta - broken paths - open drains etcWe wouldn't choose Seminyak again
Steven W,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"The beach is an open expanse of water, running many kilometres in each direction.  Care must be taken as there are sand bars close to the beach causing rips and second waves which casual swimmers will find hard.The surf is close to the beach, forming and closing only 50 metres from the water edge, yet allows the wave to run all the way to the sand.  So allows beginner surfers some opportunity to catch smaller sets to get on board and enjoy."
Teresa S,"Hervey Bay, Australia",Jul 2014,Always busy but always nice sometimes too many hawkers they get tiresome but it's bali so what to expect 
rudy_setiawan,"Batam Center, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"much better beach compare to Kuta, Sanur and Nusa Dua.. it has a beautiful sunset and brownie sands.. it feel much relax here compare to other beach. Recommended to visit"
eztraveller73,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,This is by far the best beach we saw in Bali. The beach is clean and you can see people enjoying walks and the health conscious ones running along the long stretch of white sand. The shacks/restaurants all have beanbags with umbrellas setup for their patrons to enjoy the beautiful sunset while sipping on a Bintang or a fancy cocktail.  Plenty of live music choices and some had DJs playing a good mix of old skool music and todays tunes.
NosfromMaroubra,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,"I guess like other Australians, you just can't compare this beach to the beautiful beaches in Aus. Its fine for a jog or walk in the morning on the dark grey sand but I didn't want to swim here due to all the rubbish washed up each morning and the smelly lines of drains washing into the sea every so often.  I kept to Hotel pools."
Morris120,"Chaiyaphum, Thailand",Jul 2014,Relaxing water and laid back feeling. Not many shopping areas along the beach. Very good place to chill at night. Worth to visit in Bali if you're around.
gdbalidriver,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"This beach is located on the north beach of Kuta. From Kuta, Legian and Seminyak you can reach on foot. Its atmosphere is almost the same as Kuta, except for its location a bit far from the bustle of Kuta, Legian and Seminyak beach visitors not as much as the beach of Kuta. You can also do the activity that goes on Kuta beach. Swimming, sun bathing on white sand, surfing, playing football on the coast, also enjoy the panoramic view at sunset.Interestingly, in all the way to the coast line stand Seminyak restaurant that offers dishes that tastes so Yummy, from low price to expensive price and also there are a plenty of luxury beach club, of the traditional dishes to international cuisine. That why the street called eating street."
Mayberries,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,"Being from Australia it's hard to find better beaches elsewhere, but rubbish on the beach is just a big no! If you want to swim in a clean ocean or lie on a lovely sandy beach I wouldn't recommend Bali. "
szkut,"Kincumber, Australia",Jul 2014,"Found this to be the best beach around the Kuta area, although always busy. Our 1st day was perfect, great waves for body surfing. But then our next 3 visits it was way to rough and rips everywhere, I would have to say if in Australia the beach would have been closed.But all in all if you are staying in the area it is a good option. We personally liked the more southern beaches which did have white sand, here the sand is a grey colour."
mitch507,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"You could get four couches for 50,000 per hour for the four, if you shop aroundGood fun trying surfingBeer o'clock lots of nice places after three hours in surf and sun"
sasiki1,"Steamboat Springs, CO",Jun 2014,"like it was so close, but I wouldn't say its the greatest looking beach. But store and other things for shopping is a plus if you want to fall for overpriced trinkets. Beach also has restaurants along the beach where you can watch the sunset with a drink, meal, and music in the breeze. "
montygulati27,"New Delhi, India",May 2014,"I beg to differ here from FLORANE C that no body disturbs you there are vendors selling so many things on this beach and other beaches in Bali ... jewellery , hair braiding , popcorn , tatoos etc but nonetheless , the beaches are clean and quiet.food options are limited as the restaurants are a bit far away but you can have a chilled bintang and enjoy."
ChilliKoala,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2014,"waves are too big for swimming, but great if you are not an expert surfer and would like to try body surfing or boogie boarding. Beach and waters are clean, and not as crowded as Kuta tend to be."
Frolane C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2013,You can stroll along the beach. It's clean. There are some wooden sofa for sunbathing. You can stay as long as you like. Nobody will disturb you. 
berti26,nottingham,Jun 2014,"better beaches in other parts of the island, but you can book a taxi for the day cheap, big W and rock bar and potato head good for sunset cocktails and music"
Amelia B,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,The sand is black but that's not a major problem because you can hire a sun lounge for cheap. It's a bit difficult to relax because you are constantly being bugged by people wanting you to buy stuff although it's not as bad as Legian & Kuta.
wieke r,23 contributions,Jul 2014,"My kids love this beach because they can learn how to surf and in the afternoon walking around the beach watching ppl playing soccer, jogs, flying kites...then watching sundown sitting on a puff at the restaurant in front of the beach :) "
Kerrienat,"Mackay, Australia",Jul 2014,"Seminyak beach was a lovely way to spend the evening, great food, music, fun and relaxation. A variety of eating places offering a great variety of foodstuff at reasonable prices. Wonderful grilled fish."
Richard C,25 contributions,May 2014,"No better place to walk and watch the sunset.Try  Walking  from La Lucciola towards Kuta for an hour around 4pm, turn around and head back to La Luche for a refreshing Bintang and Mango Daquari and watch the sunset. What cold be nicer, oh yes, a refill"
sarahluni,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jun 2014,the beach of seminyak is surprisingly clean. i loved it there since there arent as many tourist and local people there as in Kuta. I was less bothered here by locals trying to sell stuff. I took surfing classes and succeded quiet well. I guess everywhere in the South of Bali you will find really good surfing teachers.
Naomi D,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,The seminyak beach area was smellier with a lot more rubbish. We walked along further towards legion and the beach was cleaner with less sewage flow onto the sand.
Ann W,"Doonan, Australia",May 2014,"Get down there early or you wont get the best spot... the sunsets are amazing to see.. and there are many different places to park your bum, the bean bags are comfortable and the sellers are cheaper then you get on the street."
WorldTravellerPerth,Perth,Jul 2014,"This main stretch of beach running across Seminyak-proper is home to dark sand and a considerable amount of rubbish. Unfortunately there are a number of creeks and storm-water drains that empty onto this vast area, meaning refuse, pollutants and excrement flood onto the sand in places.While there are [visibly] some good waves on offer, and there are a few restaurants/bars/clubs opening onto the beach, this would be one to be avoided. There are many options available on the island, and - coupled with the persistent 'salespeople' offering a variety of beach-side up-sells (e.g. board-hire, sun-bed hire, trinkets) - this is not a good one."
Yiya68,"Darwin, Australia",Jun 2014,"I have been to Bali a few times and this is the bets that I have seen Seminyak Beach.  It was mostly clean and overall a nice experience.  Love the bars by the beach, I reccomend Ku De Ta.  The beach sellers can be a bit pushy and the banana lounge prices can have a big range in price so shop around and bargain with them.  No toilets unless  you go to a bar."
Michael R,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,"Along the 2km stretch of beach at Seminyak, there are about 5 or 6 storm water / creeks that flow into the ocean. They are all polluted with rubbish and raw sewage. the stench is disgusting and the unless you're a surfer on a board and can paddle out, swimming in that is asking for dysentery. The council / government really needs to invest in proper sewerage treatment otherwise tourists are just not going to come back. Go to south to Balantan or much further north to swim in the brochure / website photos or swim in your own villa's pool."
SandeepKale,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2014,"Visited this beach during sunset. Nice beach to spend some time in the evening. There is live music, it wasn’t much crowed."
MMichels,"Sao Paulo, SP",Jul 2014,I was totally disappointed when arrived at Seminyak beach. The sand was filthy and smelt bad. I spend just some minutes there and decided to go back to hotel. 
Jackie H,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,There's heaps of great beach bars along this strip.Lots to look at but way to many blokes handing out those stupid cards. grrrr.
Edyta R,"Gouda, The Netherlands",Jun 2014,"Another disappointment in Bali... Don't bother to come over, stinky, poor surroundings, a lot of dogs (make sure you walk around with shoes on!)."
Pasbuc,"Basel, Switzerland",Jun 2014,"Seminyak Beach has a few nice little restaurants right on the beach. Even though it is a bit touristy...the food is good and the price value ratio is also good. Had some fantastic fresh red snapper for dinner and the atmosphere around the restaurants was quite chilled out! When the sunset is happening quite a lot people sit around, eat and drink something and are watching the sunset - not bad at all! "
Alex B,"Island of Malta, Malta",Apr 2014,"Not a fan of this beach to be honest. It wasn't crowded when I went which was a plus, but it isnt as appealing as other beaches.Fee to use the sun loungers but  this is pretty standard."
Champersmk,"Melton Mowbray, UK",Jun 2014,"Watching the crashing waves, lounging on sunbeds, sipping ice-cold sodas. Clear blue water, friendly people and soft sand"
haminchung,"Seoul, Seoul, South Korea",Jun 2014,"But maybe the worst place if you plan a swimming or snorkelling.At sunset, you can take a arcane photos"
vee_vita,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jun 2014,"At a very busy season like the end of June to August, Seminyak beach is still better than Kuta as it's lee crowded. You can find many sun beds by the beach with paying 50k for a pair of them. Many sellers (accessories to masseuse) will prob come over to where you sit to offer their stuffs. You can avoid this in the evening (about 4 pm and after) when the cafes by the beach are open, you can sit in the bean bag for free (just order some drinks or food, ofc). The beach itself, you can deft learn to surf there as it is flat and good for beginner. The sand - unlike the description here in TA - is black sparkling volcanic sand instead of white. Sunset is quite nice here."
Les M,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,dissapointed with this. Overcrowded noisy and not value for money or particularly nice. Save your money for other places
nogenmania,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2014,in bali you can find so many beautiful beaches. Every beach had their own speciality.You can enjoy sunset here. Fantastic!
CarrieAnnBurgess,"Buderim, Australia",Jun 2014,Loved the ability to get away from the peddlers (if you want) after strolling around town and just relax sipping on a nice Bintang at the great resting point of Ku De Ta!
Matty T,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2014,The sunset here is breathtaking and there are many places along the way you can see it. Staying away from the stalls on the beach is highly recommended. There are many very famous bars along the beach which have great food and music. But be aware some require men to wear t-shirts and not singlets.
Arrael H,"New York City, NY",Jun 2014,"Easy to get to, goes for miles and there's restaurants/bars every few feet to dip into when you need a bite to eat or drink. Renting an umbrella and a chair is a must. Be warned, you will be harassed by locals selling goods all day. "
Emilia_L86,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"So my friend and I explored seminyak, nusa dua, jimbaran beaches... And we concluded seminyak was the best, the waters were the cleanest and clearest, and with the restaurants by the beaches to chill out to it was the best. The others were dirty with litter and part of isolated and boring areas. "
Vasantha,27 contributions,Jun 2014,"As we stayed in Seminyak the beach was just a 5 minute walk from our hotel. We decided to go there to catch the sunset. And on the day we went, it was a beautiful low tide with the sunset reflecting on the wet sand. it was the most beautiful scenery i ever captured! And as most of the tourists were at the beachside bars and restaurants it was not crowded at the water at all. Probably it wasnt safe too. But i just wanted to wet my feet by the shore and i could do that for a short while before the waves got a bit wild and i moved out! Best place to go to if you want to capture some nice sunset."
YC74,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2014," Relaxing and beautiful scenery. Great for surfing and sun bathing. Beautiful long sandy beach, Fresh air and can be romantic place and Scenery for honeymooners :) great place to visit "
whisker11,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2014,"Seminyak beach is a surfer's beach and not really for swimming. The waves can be huge and the undercurrent strong. During low tide, you can probably walk out quite far in waist deep water although the waves might still knock you off your feet.  There are a number of peddlers but this is no where near as annoying as the ones you find in Samui or Phuket. The great thing about the beach is there are no parasailing or jet ski operators spoiling the beach with noise and gasoline. You could just lay a beach towel on the sand, or pay private operators to rent a padded lounge chair and umbrella which is what we did in the end. It's a lot more comfortable for a few dollars an hour. "
Australiantraveller7,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,"there are many places to eat, have drinks, view the sunset and have a massage. You do get asked to buy on the beach but it's not intrusive and will leave you alone if you say no. Everyone's really so friendly"
Georgia,"Manchester, UK",Jun 2014,Spent majority of our time in Seminyak on this beach.. Perfect place to grab breakfast at one of the beach bars watching the sea/surfers.. Then sunbathe on a bed which is next to nothing in cost.. The option of surfing is there but if you don't want to you can go in the sea without being bothered by surfers.. At about 5pm all the large bean bags come out and umbrellas with lights ready for sunset with a couple of bars playing music. It was perfect to grab a couple of drinks and some tapas on the bean bags watching the sun go down..
pb0rd0 .,4 contributions,Jun 2014,"love the beach life, love the surf. the people there are a different bread - making you feel welcome and singing along with their guitars while drinking a bintang couldnt get any better. "
Micachou,"Austin, TX",Jun 2014,"Now I have read some reviews about this beach being dirty and seen the pictures too.  It really has to so with timing your visit. Apparently, in the winter the currents bring tones of trash that has been churning across the sea and dumps it on the beaches in large quantities.  When I visited in June, the beaches were very clean.  From the end of May until November, I am told, is the best time to visit.  Even so, I witnessed beach cleaners through out the day, cleaning the sand of things not just washed up, but things left by beach goers.  We have to be responsible visitors, too.  There was very little litter, that I could see and I spent two entire days there. There are people trying to sell you things, but hey, it's a living.  You can say no, put on head phones, stick your head in your book, or juts ignore them.  I rented a chair for the day, and had a great time.  If I wanted fresh pineapple, a cool drink or a sarong, someone would be by to offer one for sale.  I would recommend giving it a try.  "
claguey1,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2014,"wide open beach, however open sewer nearby which flows straight into the sea, so you MUST swim upstream. Usual litter prevails, not so blighted by hawkers"
Macarena G,"Santiago, Chile",Jun 2014,"When the tide is up, there is no beach sand to stay so you HAVE to rent chairs or beds, there is also too many people trying to sale fake goods, bracelets and more."
JEC306,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,"The restaurant with bean bags on the sand had great food and for $3 per bag, you can stay all day.  The surf is good, if a little dangerous.  So many Aussies, thought we were at Lorne!!"
HdC1006,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,Not a very clean beach with broken glass and many dogs running along in groups.  Also does not look too safe in the ocean.  I would not recommend thinking this will be a beach holiday.  Unless you are looking at it from a poolside seat in one of the hotels opposite!
Jo T,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2014,"Loved sitting in the bean bags on the beach, sipping cocktails and watching the sunset - great atmosphere :) "
1800hammer,"Central Coast, NSW, Australia",May 2014,"I have to say, I wasn't impressed with Seminyak Beach. I just can't put my finger on it. Was it the putrid sand, the litter strewn from one end to the other, the broken glass? I even saw a guy with a dog throwing a light bulb into the ocean for the dog to retrieve, yep - a lightbulb!. Of course on one toss it broke and sunk for some unsuspecting person to cut their foot open on.It's not even pretty to look at, and doesn't compare to the thousands of golden beaches we have here in Oz."
angiegala24,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,We sat here about 3 times- just outside KUDeTA.  The life guards were never watching the water - probably because the flags were never up thus  we weren't allowed to swim here.  The people with the chairs and drinks stand were horrible- prices changing daily and they constantly wanted to know when you would be moving on.    Kudeta is great  therefore we started sitting on the lounges and ordering our drinks- much better than sitting on the beach.  Better service and environment 
Sean E,7 contributions,May 2014,"Nearest to the hotel so I went there.. Relaxing water and laid back feeling.. Not many shopping areas along the beach, have to go to the Seminyak street to do it"
Russell087,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2014,"People were swimming in this not very clean, black sandy beach but I'd prefer not too. there are dangerous rips and undertows as well - better swimming elsewhere."

Theresia S,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2014,"i love seminyak better than kuta beach. because it's not as crowded as kuta. it was breezy and calm. i spent my entire evening here, from 3 to 7 PM. i cant swim, so the red signage flags--that given warn about swimming prohibited area--didn't affect me at all :D they rent the chair (and the umbrella) for approximately IDR 50.000 - IDR 70.000. and it was sooo cozy. imo, truly a perfect place to see sunset."
rageshree,"New Delhi, India",May 2014,"The seminyak beach is  much better than kuta (not overly crowded) just relax, sip coconut water...dont fall for the massages they offer at the beach. try bakso...it's great. the sunset is also beautiful.  "
A F,45 contributions,May 2014,"Red flags mark areas off- limits to swimmers because of dangerous tides.  We also were concerned by polluted water flowing into the ocean at several points.  One must cross through these foul smelling streams to keep walking along the beach.  otherwise, great for surfers.  Best to go to beach clubs along the water."
Hakim H,15 contributions,Nov 2013,It was breezy and just wonderful. Very good place to chill at night. The waves are just awesome. Worth to visit in Bali if you're around. 
BJohnC,"Stroud, UK",May 2014,"A lovely flat beach several kilometres long to amble along, in early morning or late afternoon you'll see the beautifully styles fishing boats being pushed out into the waves - quite a sight.  In the evening restaurants spread accross the beach, fish is really good.  Make sure you haggle, if in a group a plate of various fish and shell fish is good value and they'll usually discount. Use anti-bug spray on legs and ankles to avoid bites - not a huge problem but common on sand.  "
Kavita,"Mumbai, India",May 2014,"Very few vendors chewing your brains trying to sell beads, massages or kites and stuff...deck chairs at IDR 50,000 for 2 for 2hours, brilliant waves for surfing with a few good looking men doing so, clean beach with black sand....we will be back"

Hazcom,10 contributions,Mar 2014,"not my type of Bali, very fake, upperclass want to be's, I love seminyak , lived there for 3 years but too many people thinking they pay too much so they must own the place and the locals, locals get treated like underpaid slaves here in their own country"
Excalibur340,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2014,The beach itself......so many bar by the beach.....love the idea of watching sunset on a beanbag with ur favorite drink or cocktail and not forgetting the music.....it's just drive u....
nicklamport,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2014,"I guess coming from Australia it's hard to find good beaches compared to what we have back home, however I was truly shocked at the state of Seminyak Beach. The rubbish was piled up on the beach, mostly plastic bottles. The water was filthy as well with rubbish in it. I couldn't believe people were actually swimming and sunbathing on the beach. I will not be returning, there are much better beaches, cleaner beached around Asia."
AngAmanda,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2014,"This is a very clean beach and great for just lying down to tan, surfing, or even renting a beach chair with umbrella. The downside would be hawkers trying to sell various things (shades, shawls etc.) to you while you're lying on the beach. There are little bars selling food like sandwiches, desserts and drinks along the beach too."
Kaz S,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2014,I did love this beach while I was there. I've been to a few in Kuta but this one is quieter and I felt a lot more relaxed there
Jana S,"London, UK",May 2014,"Great, clean and long beach for lovely walk. Lots of locals trying to sell all sort of stuff, but one ""no"" takes care of them. They don't keep harassing. Lots of fancy bars along the beach. Sea can bit little rough at times"
flyrobfly,"Leeds, UK",May 2014,"This was actually my favourite beach in Bali (including Lombok and Gillis). It is wide and long, beautiful views. You can sunbath anywhere you fancy or hire a sun lounger for 100,000 for the full day. Lots of nice cafes and it is hive of activity in the evening with many many nice restaurants. Also worthy of note is that it is an excellent surfer beach, for beginners or professionals! The waves break quite far out giving you a really long surf back in."
piyuko,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Dec 2013,"Unfortunately saw this beach on our last day stay in bali and got very less to enjoy there.But truely, its beautiful and very clean.You feel so relaxed."
LynetteAnne M,6 contributions,May 2014,Waves crashing beautiful scenery. Lots of people and friendly. Very clean and seating provided was adequate. White waves and we could see the storm coming in to cool down our day. It rained very heavy two nights in a row. It definitely cooled down when rain came. Lots of people swimming at the beach. Some fishing in the evening.
Celinechan,"Petaling Jaya, Malaysia",May 2014,"This is a much better beach than Kuta Beach. Its much cleaner and bigger. Loads of lounge chairs and surf boards for rent. The beach sand is quite dark compared to Thai beaches. As for the waves, i'm not brave enough to go near them."
Lombok Friendly,"Lombok, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"This is maybe not the best beach in Bali, but it is the best place to watch the sunset. I spend every weekend either swimming or just watch the beautiful sunset."
Pankaj7269,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2014,"Seminyak beaches are quiet but not very clean, I would say, but less crowded, less shops around but great beach side dining area, offers lovely music & soothing experience."
Tsj A,"Toronto, Canada",Mar 2014,"We know Bali is not about beaches only, but we found Seminyak Beach very average. We have been to many more scenic beaches in many different countries. But if you want a place to sit at a beach side café and relax for a few hours, it does the trick. I would not recommend going in the water, though."
bonjourajat,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2013,i liked the privacy and cleanliness of beach with a less curvy surface compared to kuta beach. You can really have a relaxed time here in lesser crowd and more beautiful view than kuta
Laura,London,Apr 2014,"Chill out down the end at the beach bars, bean bag hop along and listen to live music.  We watched a wedding too, great spot for people watching :-)"
Bungchow,"Cairns, Australia",Apr 2014,"The day we went the beach was quite clean, there hadnt been any rain the week we were there so i guess we were lucky. This definately isnt a white sand beach, its the regular black/brown sand you find in legian/kuta as well. There is plenty of places to eat along the beach and plenty of sun lounges to rent, we paid 10k for two for the day. The water is nice, there are plenty of waves, but its not a real good place for kids or the inexperienced to swim, there are several big rips and a strong current. While we were there 2 guys got pulled out the back behind the waves while everyone sat around and watched, there are no lifesavers here, eventually someone swam out to help them swim back in. You dont get hassled as much here as you do in Kuta but there are still plenty of hawkers walking the beach, but its bali and u come to expect that. Overall its an ok beach for a days swimming and people watching but i wouldnt recommend it for young kids or inexperienced swimmers, stick to sand castles"
wtnewell,"seattle, wa",Jun 2013,"The water is a little murky, and the sand is a dirty brown, but the waves are nice and this is a fun for playing in the water."
Rodney P,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2014,"The dirty beach in colour and with rubbish as well as filthy deck chairs, although the little bars sell cold bitang beer and are cheaper than in town "
pbuzzoni,"Monte-Carlo, Monaco",Jan 2014,"Let me say that I am still impressed for the beaches of Bali, but in the unbelievable way.Nobody from the western world could ever imagine the images you are about to see.Folks, just check the pictures..."
Nicole C,"Zurich, Switzerland",Mar 2014,"the beach and the ocean where so dirty, you literally swim through plastic. they are trying to clean the beach up, but there's so much rubbish, that it looks the same every morning :-( rather take the time and drive half an hour up north or south... its clean and beautiful"
Michelle,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2014,"So much better than kuta beach - much cleaner, better surf and less crowed - another bonus is less people trying to sell you useless things "
Tangmaster,"Lancelin, Australia",Mar 2014,"Seminyak is the only location with a number of bars right on the beach, providing bean bags/umbrellas, food, cold drinks & evening music to go along with the sensational sunsets. Try the Champlung Bar amongst others for a great early evening treat."
richardsmyname,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2014,"The beach has pretty strong waves and with the dark looking sand, just isn't that inviting to lay on. There are areas where the beach looks quite dirty and littered with garbage. We intended to spend some time on the beach in Seminyak, but after looking at it, decided not to. "
Jocaloda,"Geneva, Switzerland",Apr 2014,"Already reviewed this in my hotel review. Flagged off zones for swimming but no lifeguards in those areas. No hawkers as all the roaming sellers were pleasant. Nice sand, no coral,or rocks under a raging but fun sea. Bodyboarding and surfing great fun."
Jay M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2014,I'm always disappointed by Seminyak beach. It's not always clean.  Sometimes the hawkers get really annoying. 
Reb2908,Mauritius,Apr 2014,Clean and wonderful waves crashing us back on the shore. Really nice sand and awesome sunset view. Availability of beach chairs and umbrellas on the beach itself for a good price. amazing experience.
Weechi89,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Apr 2014,Having beers along the beach.quite good but people keep on selling thingsoffering good masssage but it actually need to negotiate with them. coz i was offered with 50k for neck massage only.
Pravin T,Darjeeling,Apr 2014,Clean and neat beach with restaurants all around. Amazing sunset and view. Having dinner on the beach was an incredible experience.
Maxwellk24,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2014,"As with all the beaches north of Kuta,forget about golden sands,forget about clean beaches forget about clean swimming.Unless you are staying at a top hotel,the condition of the beach is totally reliant on the previous high tide.The beach will either be spotlessly clean or littered with so much rubbish you would be inclined to think you are wallowing in a rubbish tip.And the ocean at times is not fit for swimming with oil slicks polluting the water and the sand.Given all that negativity,to walk in the sort of serenity that a sunset beach provides is more than relaxing and the sunsets can be awesome."
John H,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2014,"Very wide and clean and the water nice and warm, with very few local sellers, not that it was a problem, nice people"
raya1303,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Mar 2014,Like an idiot I got up and went to the beach only to realize that its not the best place to expect sunrise!!! lolz. But it was nice and calm. 
WorldboyMarco,"Coffs Harbour, Australia",Apr 2014,"So if you like strolling on the beach at sunset, or enjoying extended beachside lunches, Seminayak is the place to be. The beach is wide and the surf is good if you have the skills. Swimmers are advised to only swim between the red and yellow flags, not where there are red flags, due to the rips or large waves. There is a good choice of beach bars, clubs and restaurants for day or night-time entertainment. Good for people watching. Can be windy though."
Guinness1961,"Shenyang, China",Apr 2014,"We spent late afternoon and early evening at this beach. Mixed feelings. The water and sunset were stunning. The view of the beach was very disappointing. There was garbage all along the beach. What a shame, this is such a beautiful area and should be more cared for by everyone. We had to watch where we were walking to avoid the mess. We got some great pictures of the sunset."
Lisa S,Gold Coast,Apr 2014,Beautiful place to go on sunset- We sat on bean bags and sipped cocktails and had dinner there. They also play live music.highly recommend it!
Donna D,"Mudgee, Australia",Apr 2014,"The sunset was beautiful, beach had a fair bit of rubbish on it. So different to Aussie beaches. I did not swim just went for a walk up the beach so did 300 other people to watch the sunset."
KennyYVR,"Vancouver, Canada",Apr 2014,"This probably isn't a well warranted review, based on experience, but here goes!  We walked to Seminyak Beach from our villa in the Jalan Kunti 1 area (near to Bali Deli), the first night we arrived to Bali.  We've been here a month - give or take - and I have not returned.  Early evening, and it's about a 20 minute, winding walk through the streets of Grosinyak to get there.  We arrive to find, not so much a beach, but more akin to a newly started landfill.  Plastic, garbage, washed up debris of all sorts, littering the beach and floating in the water.  Not exactly a Kodak moment!  And yet - swimmers, surfers and sun worshipers galore!  I guess it's that ""when in Rome"" mentality?  (I'd rather just go to Rome!)  Oh wait!  I lie!  We did walk the beach a second time during a pouring rain storm, which was a million times better as there were only a handful of folks around, and clean-up crews were hard at work which was great to see, but limited to the beach-fronts of the fancy hotels.  My concern on that day - what the hell is hiding in that grey water that flows from the klongs - directly in to the sea???  Shameful!"
Jialong,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2014,"I have been to many beaches all over the world, and this one is pretty special in its own way. Although the sand are pretty dark and looks like mud when its wet, but the reflections at about 6 to 7pm were beautiful! You can see your own reflections or even those of the clouds when the tide is low. Probably one of the more beautiful beaches in the world (when there's not too many people)."
Belinda H,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,Went for long walks and beach runs. Can't say I was crazy for the beach. Get quite irritated if I just want to sit down and have a glass of wine and hawkers are constantly there trying to sell you their wares. Plenty of places to sit down and enjoy a meal or drink. 
Valerie B,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Mar 2014,A lovely wide beach with rolling surf. Good to see graders out each morning cleaning up the beachfront. Many cafes nearby. Lovely breezes as you walk.
anna318,"serangoon gardens,s'pore",Mar 2014,We reached the beach before sunset so we somewhat avoided the crowd but reached in time to catch the sunset. BEAUTIFUL
Renilicious,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2014,Visited this beach one time only during our recent stay a few hundred metres up the road. Terrible experience.Upon approaching the beach we were instantly bombarded by local women trying to braid our hair and sell clothing etc. They were extremely pushy and would not take no for an answer and grabbed my daughters hair and started to braid it expecting to be paid. And they were way over priced. But get sucked in. The beach was dirty and not a pleasant place at all. I definately would not swim in the water.
Geraldine P,"Ipswich, UK",Mar 2014,Althought there is an attempt to clean the beach everyday the sea is full of rubbish and it is deposited every high tide.  Walking in the sea is not pleasant as rubbish wraps itself around your legs
chmeee5,"Blackburn, Australia",Mar 2014,"The beach itself was really great; beautiful sand, good looking surf and excellent views around the bay. The environs however, left much to be desired. There is rubbish/garbage everywhere along the beach-side streets and around the vendor areas just onto the beach.It's such a shame really because once away from that area it really is beautiful."
Debbiea21,"Niddrie, Australia",Mar 2014,"Really clean beach, fantastic to just stroll along and wet your feet. Many cafés to stop along the way for a quick drink or a bit to eat."
AlexGourmetraveller,"Athens, Greece",Jan 2014,"The beach is full of toxic garbage coming from the city with the rain flow. Others say that they come from the ocean from the fishing boats. No matter how they come its a terrible view (see 2 pics attached), people come with trucks and clean it every afternoon but they are so many that they can t do anything about it… or many they can? educate their people not tho throw garbage anywhere? of course this takes decades, meantime enjoy the little bar/restaurants on the beach which some of them have gray food!"
Ailmarsh,"East Kilbride, UK",Mar 2014,Ate good quality 'tapas' in Bar La Plancha. ........we live in Spain & didn't expect Spanish style food on a beach in Bali!
GrandmaFunk,"Holsworthy, UK",Mar 2014,"I can't believe how much crap there is on this beach - mostly plastics. Sometimes you'd see people scraping it up, but not enough to make much of a difference. Having stayed in Sanur a couple of times previously, where the beaches are pretty immaculate, this came as a nasty shock. Also, not good for swimming as the currents are strong. Good for surfers though - nice breaks."
butterbeat,Singapore,Mar 2014,Sand was grey and the water had millions of small plastic bits floating around in it. The foam was actually yellow! Will never come back nor recommend.
Eddie D,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"We came here around 10 am, which is pretty hot around that time. We cant buy anything because there was no street vendor yet. The beach little bit dirty, but still nice place to hang out."
Jazzventures,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2013,We didnt stay here for even 5mins we got turned off from all the rubbish on the beach and it was upsetting to see it the way it was
sammiejoe89,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2014,"I didn't even want to swim because of the garbage floating everywhere! The waves were huge though so pretty good for surfing as long as you don't mind landing in a load of floating wrappers etc! if you just want to chill with a beer on the sand this is pretty standard, you can get a cheap bintang from a few vendors instead of paying extra at the bars."
Adam C,7 contributions,Jul 2013,It's just another awesome beach to kick off your shoes and find somewhere to stop for lunch or dinner. 
Pamela A,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2014,"The beach is not for swimming just walk along the beach, dog walking or just pick a spot to sit and watch the sunset!"
Shasharina,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Mar 2014,"As lovely as the weather was in Bali last week, the one thing I just could not stay silent about is how dirty the beach was. There were rubbish that formed a tide line here on Seminyak, and also along Kuta. It was such an eye sore. And worse, true to its name, there were oil slicks coming in with the waves. Seminyak in bahasa means ""one oil"". I guess Bali really didnt want to disappoint. If you want the beach, go elsewhere. Heard Sanur is far better...or even Nusa Dua....or anywhere else, but...But if you dont want the beach, then why even go to Bali? I just had the misfortune of not doing enough research about the island. Probably deluded by the many glorified romantic tales - blame eat pray love for that! But if you seek to just chill and unwind, then, this island is ideal. And this part of Kuta (contrary to popular belief, Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is in reality ONE area) is the quieter portion. Food wise? For Asians, it's not really value for money at all. Drinks are rather pricey too. Shopping for the ladies? Sure...Bangkok's cheaper. Heck, even KL is far cheaper. Nightlife? In Seminyak? They only have 2 options, apart from dinner. One is the high end restaurants-turn-club-after-dinner, the other...well, if you dont swing the other way, and do not like diva shows, then hail a cab and hit Jalan Legian, Kuta instead.But the one thing I enjoyed Seminyak for was the hospitality at the hotel and restaurants I went to. But probably an advantage that I can speak Indonesian."
Hal E,"Chicago, IL",Mar 2014,"The beach is wide and flat and the water is warm. The sand can get hot, however. On this side of Bali the rip current (undertow) is quite strong so be very careful when swimming."
Maria P,"Perm, Russia",Mar 2014,Nice long beautiful beach!I highly recommend to go to La plancha beach bar for the sunset!Sunsets are just incredible on bali!
Simon M,"London, UK",Mar 2014,"A tide line of rubbish stretching from Seminyak to Kuta with dogs fouling on top of the trash. When it gets windy more rubbish blows in from Java, which covers the beach in bottles and plastic."
sisca h,"Pulau Ubin, Singapore",Aug 2013,very beautiful beach we could enjoy the sunset while enjoying a cup of tea in the cafe. Only five minutes from our hotel stay.
Cruisin57,"Perth, Australia",May 2013,Please be very careful swimming at this beach very strong rips.  We were there on the Saturday and a girl nearly drowned the lifesavers did not spot her straight away however another surf board rider came to her rescue they had to resuscitate her and then off to the hospital she was not looking very good.  Another man went in after her and he had to be helped back in from the Lifesavers as well if not for their efforts I feel both would have drowned - well done to those who helped.
EDEN_BALI,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2013,Its simply the best beach along Seminyak and Petitenget temple.. we have so many option to go dining there.. the beach is very clean and Lots of Ceremonial event Happen there at all week..Reccommended....
fachroudane,"Kediri, Jawa Timur, Indonesia",Apr 2013,"sunset on the beach of Seminyak is charming, the people are very friendly and does not cost much to do this tour"
AngelinaK656,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2013,"we greatly enjoyed the time with our family at the beach. and we stopped at one of the cafe's in seminyak  while looking at the beautiful sunset. It was late, we continue to shop in the area seminyak. A very impressive."
kormensandiego,"Manila, Philippines",Mar 2013,"The views are great here, you can have a quiet stroll without bumping into too many people like Kuta for example.  The only thing I disliked was that even in this part of the beach, which is supposedly the most upscale, there are still small patches of garbage seen on the sides.Nice place to catch a beach offering ceremony in the morning, with local men and women coming from the nearby Pura Petitenget."
Daryllee84,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2013,Nothing special about the beach to be honest... many people were there but it wasn't really clean or pretty to begin with. The nearby areas are very crowded. 
BenAlana2013,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2013,"Beautiful and peaceful, the beach is clean...with one of Bali's best restaurants located right there - La Lucciola!! Absolutely wonderful!"
Geetika T,"New Delhi, India",Feb 2013,"Very clean beach , not very crowded i think thats what makes it different ...had an amazing time there ."
GRT7V,"Cottingham, UK",Jan 2013,Worse beaches I have ever winessed and I have visited more than 70 countries. Paradise Bali is not! Rubbish is all over the beach. Some of it piled up for the tide to take it out and hey presto...bring it in again.
Globegallop,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",Dec 2012,"Beautiful position and setting, We go there every time we are in Bali and have not been disappointed yet.An oldie but a goodie!"
Alejandra C,"Guatemala City, Guatemala",Jan 2013,"The beach was clean and the water was nice although compared to other beaches in Bali it wasn´t as clear, but it could have been the tide. There where a lot of people there when we went, so it wasn´t as enjoyable as it could have been. "
kk506,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2012,go there sit down and take in the view of the sun setting down. worth it. make sure you're there by 06:30 PM
TheAussieExplorers,"Albury, Australia",Nov 2012,A must for a romantic dinner in seminyak! Great food and service overlooking the beach! Highly recommended!
WouterBaliIndonesia,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Aug 2012,Great beach but with one of the polluted rivers ending here and the growing amount of people simply no good for me.
Rors47,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2012,"The beach is great place just to laze around, it is really quite clean probably due to the Seminyak area. There are only a few people trying to sell their goods and they are respectful leaving you once you have said ""no thank you""."
William50H,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Sep 2012,"Went there in the evening, great view of the sunset, nice breeze as you see couples and families enjoying themselves, plus it a 10 mins walk away to Ku De Ta!"
sakticleaver,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2011,"Unlike the kuta beach which is dirty and crowded most of the time, you can expect a peaceful, clean and quite beach. A good place for a walk and some self-serenity. Definitely worth the visit if you need some relaxation"
ShishaLady,Singapore,Jul 2012,"Reasonably clean. Nice to walk along this beach. When tired, you can stop at any of the cafes lining the beach. Especially like sunsets at La Lucciola Restaurant"
C L,Bandar Seri Begawan,Jul 2012,"Quieter clean end of the waterfront, but be prepared to be hassled by vendors selling you all sorts of knick-knacks.  Stay firm, they'll go away after 15 mins!  "
Manager_Janet,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2012,Sad to say the beaches along Seminyak are looking more polluted than ever with what appears to be human waste in the water.La Lucciola has a nice location but when you arrive at Seminyak's main beach opposite Cocoon you can see a big brown tide of sludge in the already brown water.The storm water drainage at many points along Seminyak's beaches into the ocean looks as though you may contract something if you come in contact with it.
