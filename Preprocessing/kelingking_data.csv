ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"The Primo photo op spot on Nusa Penida! Crowds of tourists and influencers flock to the well worn outcrop above this beach to take a selfie. The best experience remains to be had on the sands below. The path to get there is steep and will require a certain stamina to retrace your steps back to the road. When you finally reach the shore, its paradise!"
Florencia M,"Palembang, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"It was last year when I visited Nusa Penida, Bali. At that time I thought Kelingking Beach is only beautiful at photos. I wasn’t expecting too much, but when me and my family arrived at Kelingking Beach I was speechless and it’s beyond my expectation! such an unforgettable memories and it’s an honor to me that I can visit this place, I would recommend you 1000000/10 to visit this place someday! even tho the weather is hot, but it doesn’t matter! You also can swim at the beach by walking down the stairs and maybe it will take for about 30 minutes to reach the beach. But trust me, it’s all worth it!"
John Jackson,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2019,"Well, I go to nusa penida island at lest 2-3 times per year with friends!So I will highly recommend you to rest before you go and have a good lunch!It will take a lot of time and effort to go down and back! I always enjoy it but Its not easy especially If not everyone in your group do work out every day ! So just get ready for people start crying!Its sunny so put some sun cream!  You can carry your water and etc but surprise surprise you can buy drinks by the beach too! Its soft drinks places so you can carry drinks or just some cash!Too about 1 hour down and back! Some people much longer!note: its no private or parking area so people just leave it anyhow! And its not easy to find this place so i will advice you to get a private guide! thats why my friends always asking me to join hahahaWe usually will racing with guys! Enjoy your day!"
Raymondale,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2019,"Visited here last year in June,it is the landmark of Nusa Penida,kelingking means pinkie finger,the famous pic of this place is the cliff form in the shape of pinkie finger,thats why the local called it kelingking(pinkie),you will be exhausted if you want to go down to the beach.but it is worth doing so.once you reach the beach,you will feel so relaxed,and want to stay here longer.but the waves is strong,so not suitable for swimming. along the way to the beach, sometimes a bit dangerous,so take care of yourself.i should stay here longer, but sadly due to limited time,have to go up to meet my driver.will come again."
TravellorNewDelhi,New Delhi,Dec 2019,there is a lot of walking to do here. but it still really amazing. At the time we went the place was quite crowded. 
Mariana Lucas,"Croydon, UK",Jul 2019,"One of the best spots in Nusa Penida. Amazing views, make sure to get there early. Luckily we got there around 10 am and there was no queue, only a few people walking up and down. Make sure to take some comfortable shoes. We took flip flops and we had to be very careful. If you are looking to go all the way down to the beach it will take you around 30/40 minutes so be prepared for the time of your life. The stairs going down are very narrow and you have to watch your step. The stairs are pretty crowded with people coming up and going down. If you are afraid of heights or if you don't have good balance I wouldn't recommend. This does require some level of fitness but once you get down, you will encounter the most amazing sand. Just watch out for the waves as they are very strong and they can pull you in. I would not recommend swimming in these waters. Perfect place for those Instagram pics! "
Daniel Makuso,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2019,You should try to come here. Want to come back again 😘. There is most people to take picture. You will see the monkey group also there 🙈
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2019,"The T Rex shaped cliff side at Kelingking Beach has rocketed tourism into the sky with its natural beauty. Thanks to social media, Instagram especially this viewpoint is now top of most people’s list of attractions when heading over Bali. The beach itself is secluded, white sandy haven surrounded by turquoise waters. "
Otmane R,13 contributions,Sep 2019,"This spot should be on everyone's bucketlist, I've never seen such a beauty, it's worth a one day visit.If you go there just be bold and do the hike (it's tiring but not dangerous)You should just mind to have a suitable footwear, sunscreen and a cap.Be careful ! if you drop your phone you'll never see it again 😂"
TheHumbleTravellers,"Greater Noida, India",Nov 2019,One of the most iconic beach in the world and no doubt why it is so. We visited this one our one day tour of Nusa Penida.Its nature's paradise.
J0andChris,"Dewsbury, England",Oct 2019,"Stunning views, can get very busy.We visited via a private tour using Warung Coconut, great value tour and extremely helpful guide.   It is quite a steep trek down to the actual beach if you decide to venture down.  The views from the cliffs above are absolutely beautiful.  There are a selection of cafe bars at the top.  Well worth a visit if you are on the island. The roads are very narrow to get there, so highly recommend using a private tour."
rolf_the_viking,"Stockholm, Sweden",Dec 2019,The trip down and up is the main thing you will need to taka swim to cool down after the walk. Reserve enough time for this if you plan to go down to the beach
Elang Prima Tours,"Flores, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"Nusa Penida it,s the best place to visiting. Beautufull panorama beach make every tourist will be come back again. You can going by Fast Boat Cruises 40 minuts from Sanur harbour. One day for visiting many place at Nusa Penida its our service."
ivani,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"I really love this beach especially if it could be a little bit quite. It is really worth to go down and do the trekking, it was like a treasure for me. "
Blefourie P,"Vancouver, Canada",Dec 2019,"The view itself is beautiful! But take the time to hike down to the beach. It's super steep but so worth it! You won't regret it! Go there late afternoon, less people and not too too hot! GO!!!"
LiesL27,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,We went there in the afternoon so it was super hot. Better to go in the morning or in the afternoon i think.Next visit i would like to climb down the white sandy beach.
Diana Satari,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"the best time to visit is in the afternoon, the less crowd, the best time to enjoy the scenery especially the sunset"
Samuel Pasaribu,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"This is the best and most famous spot in Nusa Penida. Nusa Penida can be reached by boat from Sanur Beach Harbour in 1 hour. From Buyuk Harbour in Nusa Penida, Kelingking Beach is around 30 minutes by car. From the car park we must take a walk for around 100 m. There are some viewing spots. Try all to take best picture from several angles.In holiday season this spot is very crowded. And in December also very hot.The very unique is the shape of the cape looks like t-rex head."
Steve B,"Cairns Region, Australia",Dec 2019,Always a great spot but has become a tourist Mecca in the last couple of years. It’s as good as the Instagram pics but get there early before the dayboats arrive. It gets hectic after 9am. Watch the monkeys too. No eye contact or they’ll go you. Our second visit and no doubt not our last. Will aim for sunset next trip. 
Sacha Schwarzkopf,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"The Views, awesomeThe landscape, stunningA bit of traffic going there since the streets can get very narrow.  Once there the crowd does make one a bit anxious as the first few photo opps along the stairs too are narrow.  But chill enjoy take a deep breath it’s lovely.If you wish to take the harrowing journey all the way to the beach, you really should be in good condition.  Strong legs, good knees and such.Despite some drawbacks, it’s worth the view!"
Tosia1988,Warszawa,Dec 2019,Totally amazing place. A lot of people like in every tourist places. I recommend go there as earlier you can. 
KatrinJ_est,"Tallinn, Estonia",Dec 2019,"However, its totally overcrowded. Also there is very hot, so we didnt hike down... it wud have been noce to swim there 🙂But view is nice, it was worth the visit."
Casy Ang,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,"This place is famous for the instagram-worthy picture and expects more crowd. We went there on Friday around 12pm. The place is crowded with China tourists. You have to walk around 5-8mins from carpark area to the Kelingking Beach entrance aka stairs. The stairs are quite narrow, ground not even (mud surface) and the hand rails are made from trees branches. Must be extra careful when you walk down the stairs & not to fall down because the side is high cliffs. We didn't walk all the way down because our driver said it's quite long way to hike down to the beach and bit dangerous for us. So we only stop half way and spot few picturesque views to take pictures. You might need to queue up at famous photo spot. Overall, we take around 40mins at that place. "
Victoria L,9 contributions,Oct 2019,Beautiful! This place is spectacular. The steps down to the beach are treacherous so be prepared. Part required scrambling on all fours. It was worth it for us 
A.B. De Castro,Philippines,Dec 2019,"Kelingking Beach would definitely mesmerize anyone upon seeing the natural formations. If you really want to get to the beach, you need to climb down thousand of steps that are very steep. You'll also need to allot 2-4 hours so that you could enjoy the beach because once you get finished, you'll climb the thousands of steps whence you came. If you'll stay at the top and take pictures, make sure you bring water as it is very hot throughout the day."
Kenai Drift Anglers,"Soldotna, AK",Dec 2019,"We went here twice and would recommend the same to you. We went for the sunset, parked and walked to the view point, we didn't have to pay for some reason, I think the people went home. However, we caught the sunset at perfect timing, I believe it was around 5 PM. A lot of people at the viewpoint and a lot of people walking up, they seemed so tired. Which made us a bit nervous about our next day. However, we didn't have any issues with the trek down. Take it slow! Don't get discouraged with all the people at the view point hardly anyone was actually walking down! Best time to the hike is later afternoon when it's not so hot and then you can walk up at sunset! Best way! Maybe 20 people on the beach. We would recommend not doing it in sandals we had Keen water shoes that we great for the trek! This is a must!"
calm999,"Kuta, Indonesia",Dec 2019,"Breathtaking place. I was one of the few people who went down to the beach. It was not easy at all, so be careful if you are not fit enough with good health. I found one guy on his way back laying down and can't breathe well or move, so many good. People help him restore his energy.Not to scare you, just do it if are fit and prepared well.Fore me something to remember it all my life."
Yoke,Malaysia,Nov 2019,"Amazing Sunset view! Estimate travel time around 1 hour from the port to reach here. Even is not far but the road condition will slow you down.I'm so happy that we have come here. it feel like so blessed to have this nice view together with your loved one.We bring some beer and light food sitting down and wait until sunset start. When sunset start it will be very fast, we are so happy that we able see it!True is, this place is dangerous. Once wrong step then you will say goodbye to the world. Please be careful if you have kids. It is extremely dangerous if didn't watch closely.You can go down to the beach but it is dangerous. The strong wave actually bring down few life before. The light is limited at this island. If you are not familiar, please rent you driver."
Lena,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,"Pro - nice scenery, windy, beautiful beach. Cons: only if the steps are fixed properly. Advise: You can spend longer time here and trek down to the beach, I believe it has awesome wave. "
Ktong002,"Hong Kong, China",Nov 2019,"Getting up and down to the beach not impossible, but tiring for sure (esp under bright burning sun). If you simply wanna take photos of T Rex from all angles, you dont need to walk all the way down. Instead you can go along the cafes and there is a farmland nearby where there are plenty of quiet but nice viewpoints of T Rex too."
bigwik,"Budapest, Hungary",Dec 2019,Beautiful Cliff formation thst surroinds a beach. Make sure you get there as early as possible to beat the heat and the hundreds of turists. Prepared for the bumpy roads
Cristine_02,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2019,Love it so much. Nice sea and cliffs . It Super hot but worth going. Expect to climb up n down to get a great view 
Elizabeth S,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Dec 2019,It’s not easy getting down and back up to/from the beach but it is well worth it. Not overcrowded and just stunning. 
timgiang,"Yucaipa, CA",Dec 2019,"This was by far the highlight of our vacation. While it is a crazy hike down and up and the heat is sweltering, the picturesque views at the bottom are well worth it. The sand is perfect, one can cool off in the water and the beach in general is isolated. If you’re on a tour of Kelingking, billabong beach, and crystal bay, be sure to spend the majority of your time here as the other locations pale in comparison."
Luke,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2019,"Be warned, exercise is a must :)The journey down the stairs to kelingking beach is quite difficult, so if you get exhausted easily, don’t try, as you need to go back up and it’s very steep. No other way except for the steep stairs. Half way down the mountain the stairs stop and it becomes more of a mountain climb but it has a handrail the whole time to assist in going down and back up. The beach down the bottom was totally worth the journey though as the water was perfectly clear and great for swimming in. There is a shop at the bottom that sells drinks and snacks also, as you will need refreshments after the exhausting climb down. "
Krystyna L,14 contributions,Dec 2019,"So your trip begin with the place where millions of people try to take the best photo of them, you may think that there is no place for you, but it’s not true, people do it very fast and you at least take a photo , a view is incredible for sure. Then you have an opportunity to go down to the beach , but be ready the way to beach is not for children ( I was surprised when I saw 8years old boy with father, it’s crazy) and people with health issues, because it’s a way under the sun for 30-35 min . When you go down or up you meet the people behind and front of you, the way is too narrow , so please be careful and put hiking shoes on. Don’t forget about water!!!!Finally when you already reach your destination point , it’s worth it, because you are in paradise with amazing view and enormous waves .So, you can do it, but be careful and stay positive "
Abhi5684,"Jaipur, India",Aug 2019,"The view point is quite picturesque and is simply one of the best views one gets in Indonesia, but is so much crowded that you wont feel like staying for a bit and is close to get spoiled sooner. One would struggle to get a picture with clear background.Expect a lot of driving, through bad roads, to reach to the point and is quite a walk to reach the view point."
Henry T,15 contributions,Dec 2019,"Incredible natural formation with crystal blue water and a flawless beach. Those expecting to swim in the water beware! Tides and currenst are extremely strong and not recommended for swimming. The hike down toward the beach is strenuous, with no shade available. Bring water and appropriate shoes and a small umbrella if you can!"
GRtravelling,Seattle,Nov 2019,"Becoming a definite tour destination with a crazy amount of motorbikes, vans and cars pouring into the area on narrow challenging roads.Once there, through the crowds it is a stunning view."
Loca_Lisa,"Meridian, ID",Sep 2019,"If you're thinking of motorbiking here from anywhere, rethink that and get a driver. The road is seriously bad and 15 miles turns into a hour drive to avoid the pot holes. Get here super early. As crowds get here around 9 am and parking is hard to find as well as getting a decent picture of T-Rex rock or the beach . The view is stunning, the water is the most beautiful blue. There area has few view vistas to get your picture, however lines can be long and you can easily wait 15 mins for your 15 seconds. I stayed for about 15 mins before the crowds were overwhelming.There is a few warungs located here so food and drinks are plentiful. The hike down to the beach is around 30 minutes from the top but we opted not to do it."
Irina H,"Palm Beach Gardens, FL",Aug 2019,What an experience to be able to get to this place and finally be able to lean over the cliff. The pictures are amazing but do not do any justice to the actual view. Good luck going down :)
Arney,20 contributions,Nov 2019,"Breathtaking. A must see for the world traveller. To walk down is for able bodied experienced walkers and swimmers. Not for the faint hearted as is it a sheer cliff of several hundred metres. 30 mins down, over an hour back up. Those not able or wanting to go down can still get the best photos of their lives from the top. Cold refreshments available near the car park."
Louise,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Nov 2019,"We came at 8 AM and there were o ly few other people. Lovely view. We didn't go down, because I've heard you have to slide some of the way down. They had new roads so it wasn't a problem driving scooter all the way there "
ditchthislife,"Regina, Canada",Nov 2019,"We arrived at Kelingking Beach early, before all the day-trippers, which I highly recommend. The view is absolutely stunning! We hiked only about 1/3 of the way down. The stairs are very steep and uneven. If you want to go the entire route they say it takes about 40 minutes to get down and an hour to get back up.Make sure to check out the view to the left of all of the restaurants. You can also get stunning pictures from that area."
MoNiKa D,"Witten, Germany",Nov 2019,"This trail will not be any easier, this trail will be rocky and difficult - this is absolutely perfect for kelingking beach!  If you want to get down in the heat and get back up - it has to be really good and fit, but it's worth it!  However, climbing is announced here and is not without danger!  So not suitable for everyone.  away down we needed 30 min and high 20 min.  exhausting but who made it, can be proud of itself.  The view from the top is of course unique and must be visited, if you are on Nusa Penida."
Madnesss,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019,"Firstly, the road to get to this place is very reasonable compared to many in Penida.  That’s a bonus.  So you could scooter from the harbour to hear no worries. Now this place was just to beautiful.  There are many viewing spots for this place.  You can pay a 5000rp donation to go up to a viewing platform which I did and stayed there as it was magnificent.  I launched the drone from up there too.  I did lose some gps a bit when I went high so had to bring it down a bit.  Plus I am not a very experienced drone pilot. There are monkeys here too so if you’re scared get someone to shoe them away for you.  There’s plenty of warungs to eat or drink at.  Parking tip - they charge and then point you to a parking area, however you can ride closer down and park elsewhere.  This is an absolute must see in Penida.  We did not go down to the beach, however I believe it takes about 30-45 mins down and same up.  On sometimes vertical track where you have to slide on your bum.  Not for me.  You need to be super fit to go down to the beach. "
Chris S,"Gamlingay, UK",Nov 2019,"We went in low season, but even then it was busy with Instagram warriors queuing up in sweltering heat for once spot at the top of the cliff. Ignore these clowns and walk about 100m down the cliff for the same if that's what you're there for.The preparation part: if you want to actually go on to the beach it's roughly a 25 min, relatively intense walk/climb down. Do not attempt in flip-flops, and bring a bottle of water each. There are choke points where you'll have to wait 5+ mins for people to go up/down, and it is very steep at points. Essentially they've tacted barriers onto quite a sheer cliff face.It's well worth the climb however. The beach was relatively quiet (note again low season), has a shop for drinks and light snacks.The waves were powerful. It's not a beach for chilled floating around unless you swim past the sand bar and break. (Which is totally do able). Also be aware there is a strong rip tide.Had a great time, it's very clear water aside the sand being churned up and refreshingly cool."
Marco A,"London, UK",Nov 2019,"I have to admit, having been in Nusa Penida for a few days I couldn’t be bothered to do the 45 min trek down to the actual beach itself (what people who had just done the trip told me) having done so many of the hikes for the other stuff on the island I was just happy to look over the stunning view. The beach looks insane, so kind of gutted I didn’t go down! No one was in the water and the waves seem too powerful to swim.... which is what the below reviews also say. Absolutely stunning view and a must visit. "
iamkayoh,472 contributions,Nov 2019,The view at Kelingking Beach is stunning!The place is quite busy with tourists but not overly packed. You can choose to descend the steep flight of stairs to the beach itself. But make sure you leave enough energy to climb back up! 😄Not much activities here to do there except to admire the beautiful scenery. 
Pam R,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2019,"What an amazing spot!  Water colour is stunning. White sand. Clean beach. Waves can be rough so you need to be careful. The climb up and down is for the fit otherwise it will be a struggle coming up. It is very steep and can be narrow in parts. Most of the track is made from clay so it isn’t man made ‘stairs’. We wore thongs going down, not a good idea! And we put our joggers on coming back up. If you have joggers definitely wear them. Take water a large one with you in a backpack as you will need both hands free for the climb. There is water on sale on the beach but I believe it is expensive. Only toilets are at the top of the cliff none on the beach. Do this as early as you can as it is very hot climbing. Definitely worth seeing. "
Shayan_723,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2019,Hands down one of the most beautiful places one can see. The colors of the water from up above the cliff is mesmerizing to say the least.A must visit place when in Bali/Nusa Penida. Just come prepared with good shoes and water as it can be too hot. 
Happypuppy13,2 contributions,Nov 2019,"Our trip in Nusa Penida was unforgettable moment, thanks to Mustika Nusa Penida Tour especially to Sir Dewarai, very accomodating and he knows the good spot for picture for instagram ! Super thank you kuya ! You're the best ! I will recommend this Mustika Nusa Penida Tour can speak english and very accomodating"
Asriani H,"Makassar, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"The Second time, this still recommended Beach. Clean Beach, Nice Beach, Nice Sunset in Here. Must try to go down. "
Fibaritziamo,"Nympsfield, UK",Aug 2019,"Kelingking Beach is absolutely stunning, but the hike down the mountain path is not for the faint hearted or the unfit.The path down starts of reasonably easy, after 20 mins or so it takes a turn back on its self and then the fun really starts. It was very busy and often grid locked as people are trying to come up at the same time and it is at times very tricky and you have to have 3 point contact. it took us 1 1/2 hrs to get down due to the amount of people coming up. Make sure you take water as on the cliff face it is very hot and if you are like me you is gonna sweat!There is a little stall on the beach selling water, Now foolishly I only took a small amount of water for a family of 4,not very clever! so I had to buy the most expensive water in Bali at 100,000 rps for 2 litres.The beach is stunning and you certainly feel exhilarated when you get to the bottom. The waves are huge and very strong so be very careful.The climb up was quicker as later in day and not many coming down, but one hell of a work out. My leg muscles ached so much I could hardly walk for 2 days. But one of our most memorable days out and we had some great days in Bali and Nusa Penida "
Bodil Fjellrosa,6 contributions,Nov 2019,"It's just to stand in line and wait to have a overlook down on a beach it takes one hour to go down to, in the heat! Overrated. You see it actually better on photos."
federico z,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2019,"Over booked by tourits, abandoned by the local people. The place is just for pictures in the corniche, behind is garbage !!I visited with my parents and they got disappointed cause the entire island doesn't have roads or ways in good shape. The trip for each please takes lot of time, full traffic, roads in bad condition and the worst is there is only 1 sense in the way!The are not clinic or hospitals in case of emergency. Really, this place is a lost town in middle of nothing. No authorities. My suggestion is avoid it at all cost you will spend more time traveling in the car instead of the beaches. "
Catarina Brito,United Kingdom,Sep 2019,The views are beautiful but the roads are super bumpy to get to Kelingking Beach. I would not advise to try and drive a scooter. 100% recommend hiring a driver which is the safest option.It can be very overcrowded and the access to the beach is not in the best condition. We did not go down to the beach but we could see a few people going down the cliff. The driver that was with us suggested that you would need roughly 45 minutes to go down and other 45 minutes to come back up.Be aware there are monkeys on this beach and they are not very friendly.
Weronika J,"Tychy, Poland",Oct 2019,"Worth visiting! Hot as hell though ;) 🤩🤩🤩 really nice view. Worth the trouble, signs to the place every 1km, nice view point on the left"
Omer sim,"Tel Aviv, Israel",Mar 2019,"Over touristic, but beautiful beach. I didn't go down to the beach itself just took a pic from the cliff."
Mishy On The GC,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2019,"Would highly recommend visiting here if it’s on tour bucket list. Definitely instagram worthy. The photos don’t do it justice. We didn’t do the stairs down to the beach due to personal health, however I’d you’re fit and up for it, then it is a must do. "
Liz T,22 contributions,Sep 2019,If you have little time - skip it. Such an overrated trip. Too many tourists and the experience is not worth it - unless you want to go down the beach (very very steep and dangerous and will take you at least an hour)
Nini,Male,Oct 2019,The natural of beauty is always make me feel happier and surprised. If you have chance to visit this land please must be come here and please keep the natural don’t disturb! 
Indra Yulianto,4 contributions,Oct 2019,amazing place and would like to say thank you to mr fadjar ( mansago travel ). he convince me about this trip.  i choosed 1 day Trip and me and my partner love it.. i will try to stay here for my next vacation. thank you
Tamer Alphonse,9 contributions,Oct 2019,Nusa Penida is such an overrated trip! The boat takes you 45 min from Bali to arrive to the island and you take a car and drive another 45min in the most dangerous and rocky road to just arrive in busy place so you can only take the famous picture! People with kids are highly not recommended to take them all! Avoid this trip by all means!!!
rachana bhapa,"Kullu, India",Sep 2019,I will definitely recommend this place to travellers visiting Nusa Penida. You can combine your tour with angels billalong and broken beach and then head to kelingking point and beach. It is important to note that it is very very steep so wear proper shoes with grip not flip flops and if you have bad knees and then dont get down to the beach. You can go halfway and then come back. Because at some points the steps are very high and narrow and supprted with wooden rails built by travellers on the way. The all the hike is worth it. 
Piyush Thakur,"Pune, India",Oct 2019,"Its a long review but here is what I feel There is a lot of debate on whether you should trek down to the Kelingking beach or not. Lot of vloggers have posted their videos online on the same topic and there are conflicting views on it. For me it was the trek which made all the difference. I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 9:30 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly. Every 5 minutes take a pause and just look around the surroundings , then you will realise why I am asking you to trek down. Once you reach down then you will see an absolutely gorgeous beach with so strong waves . This is what I am talking about. .. This was my best part of Bali trip and I'll come back again to spend atleat 4-5 hours on this beach. Photos don't justify the beauty of this place "
deecorrigan,"Newcastle, Australia",Mar 2019,A must see if your in this part of the world. Absolutely stunning. The road to get there is terrible. Take plenty of water.
FredBadass,4 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing beach, a must seen place. Hard to acces but 100% worth the effort. Wear shoes, not flip flopes and carefull with childrens and old people "
Andrew S,1 contribution,Oct 2019,"So crowded, long as sketchy hike down to the beach, look at  Instagram or try to go by boat. Everything on Penida is packed with tourists all taking the same photo and the roads are horrible to get everywhere. "
ThomasArabia,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2019,"First of all, its off course a breathtakingly beautiful beach. But that’s exactly the problem. Its super crowded. The hike:it looks very steep from the top. But its really doable. The first half downwards are proper albeit big steps with proper handrails. That part is safe, although already somewhat exposed. For people who feel a bit afraid here it’s probably better to turn around at the end of the proper steps, because its getting much steeper afterwards and one needs to scramble down some rocks. There are still handrails, but further down they consist of some lose bamboo sticks only. Overall its not technically difficult, but not for people who are afraid of hwights. It takes around 20 min up or down, if it would be empty. But with people in flipflops (!) and traffic jams it will take longer, and its hot! on the beach is a little kiosk to buy refreshments though."
Amy,64 contributions,Oct 2019,"It took us more than an hour to reach the beach via scooter from the harbor. The road is SKETCHY! Not all of it is paved either. I’m really glad to have seen this amazing view, and equally glad we got there and back in one piece!Once you get there, there is a pathway that takes you all the way down to the beach. It’s not an easy trek. Make sure you wear some decent shoes. "
Stefan R,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2019,"My wife and I visited Kelingking as part of a day trip to Nusa Penida during our honeymoon in Bali.Nusa Penida is not as developed as the main islands so be prepared to the tight roads, bumpy roads, and less than stellar views when not at an attraction or sightseeing spot.**Kelingking disclaimer, if you are planning on climbing down to the secret point beach, come prepared with proper shoes, water and snacks for the treacherous trek down and back up the cliff** My wife and I are both fit and avid hikers to the trek down and back up for us wasnt too bad, but you can tell why alot of people either dont do it or get injured going down or coming back up - especially coming back up in the heat or without proper hydration. Overall, it was worth the trip! "
Sophie Rosbill,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,What a gorgeous lovely beach when you’re down there after going through the steep dodgy steps.. hidden gem indeed!! Worth visiting 😊😉👍🏻
333kimberleys,21 contributions,Sep 2019,"Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins) and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot... This is dingy with rats on the rafters and you can select from 2 meals being the cheapest on the menu... This part was private as it was just me and my mum with our driver. Please take travel sickness tablets with you!!! The roads are next level horrible... I've travelled a fair bit and I have never seen roads this bad... I got car sickness in about 15 minutes... And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us. It seems noones safety is considered on this trip and in this day and age it's disappointing that so many people's life's at put at risk to make some money."
treenavel,50 contributions,Sep 2019,"Awesome view, clean great small beach, worth every effort for you to get down and enjoy.It's the most awesome and only place on earth with such beauty!To all able bodies...this is a must visit place once in a lifetime.Plan ahead, arrange car and driver as well as hotel to stay in. Cheap travel by far in comparison to other island but the view alone is worth it!"
looby29,"Carlisle, UK",Nov 2018,Had the pleasure of visiting 2018 was the most amazing place breathtaking.little tip wear good footwear
J.Bas,"Austin, TX",Aug 2019,"breathtaking scenery, awesome blue beach and white sand! Sure it is hard to get down to the beach, very step traditional stairs but once you get there, it is AWESOME"
pip112017,Singapore,Oct 2019,"Absolutely gorgeous views from the top, amazing to watch the sunset from. It’s definitely do able to hike half way down where there are physical steps to the picture points and get some nice shots. However BE WARNED once you get past the main bit (you will know when) the trail gets INCREDIBLY steep and there are no longer steps, you are from that point on literally rock climbing down an almost upright cliff. In hindsight I would not have gone down as we fell multiple times and was extremely exhausting on the way up. I have cuts on my knees from where I had to essentially crawl up. The beach down there is amazing but you could get access to a beach equally as amazing without the near death experience. If you’re physically fit and enjoy the thrill of hiking / mountain climbing then go ahead. If you’re an average person - YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!! "
Emmelinem,Emmelinem,Sep 2019,Stunning scenery bit I would recommend going early. We kept getting told off by tourists that we were in their photos. There are way too many people.
Maria Klepikova,3 contributions,Oct 2019,"Amazing!  One of the most beautiful places of I've seen. It was complocated to get there,  but it worth it"
Cristopher V,"Antwerp, Belgium",Oct 2019,"Incredible view from the cliff, absolutely amazing.From the harbour to Kelingking beach takes 45min-1h by car.Roads are not ready for this volume of tourism. Half of the way was on a too narrow asphalt road, other half was on an even smaller bumpy sand road.Arriving as usual on a parking, local shops leading to the cliff.No safety regulation nor fences to protect you from falling from the 500ft deep cliff.Didnt go down with the stairs as it was too crowded."
Jesel Santos,Philippines,Oct 2019,"The road was terrible, but the view was worth the bumpiness and narrowness of the road. A bit scary if you’re on the top but once you see the photo you’ll feel relieve. I didn’t try to go down since i was so scared of the heights. "
Lövis G,21 contributions,Oct 2019,"The narrow path leading down to Kelingking Beach challenges you because it is very steep and I wouldn't recommend it for people who are afraid of heights, carry children or don't feel stable on their feet. But also the view from the top of the cliffs at the beginning is very impressive. Ingeneral, it is so rewarding to see the beach, it's thundering waves rolling up unto the sand and just relax in the beautiful white sand under the trees. There are locals selling refreshing drinks and some food which is really nice. You can't really swim there, though, due to the super strong current. Still, if you feel comfortable enough to hike down, you won't regret it!"
Karl Englhofer,Indonesia,Sep 2019,"Hey guys, watch out when you climb down. The climb is not that difficult, but all the other tourists make it dangerous! I went there at sunset. Made a big bonfire and stayed for the night! Milkyway, Shooting stars, waves, Monkeys around. Amazing solo experience. Oh...mind the waves. they took my fire and almost me at 3 am in the morning. So make sure you sleep close to the trees! There are is also a small cave. but i preferred the sky with the stars. :) "
traveljamo,"Watford, UK",Oct 2019,"Absolutely love this place, as soon as i laid eyes on this place it instantly took my breath away, I stood at the top for a good 10 minutes taking it all in.,i got there nice and early about 9 before the mass tourists got there and it was enjoyable, me and my girlfriend decided we would venture down the beach below and wowwww! what an experience it was, my girlfriend doesn't really like heights or hikes so she found it overwhelming, there are certain parts of the climb down which are vertical with big drops which she didn't like.... me on the other hand took it all in my stride so it really does depend who you are with and your fitness level, we got down in about 40 minutes and then spent 2 or so hours on the lovely beach below the waves are massive so only swim if you are confident and strong enough,ild say the climb up is harder than going down... mainly because the heat from the midday or afternoon sun, the amount of people coming down aswell at that time is greater so there's a lot of standing around waiting for people to pass on the tight trail down   there is a bamboo hand rail that goes all the way down, be careful tho in some places this isnt sturdy and its loose!overall I would give this place 9 put of 10,  just be prepared to work for paradise 💪💪"
paddlepop p,Singapore,Oct 2019,"We came around 10am and it's filled with tourists. Good to come earlier.There are various nice spots for photo taking... There will be queues around it. If u come with your tour guide, they will queue for u.The guide told us it will take 45mins to reach the beach.. At my speed I'll likely take 1.5hours... Hence, I gave up.. And the o it if u intend to spend some time swimming at the beach. There are eateries there.. Just make sure u get all u need before u make the long journey down. "
Jessica C,"Media, PA",Sep 2019,"By far, my favorite tour while in Bali. The view was the most beautiful setting I’ve ever seen. Definitely wear walking shoes. It’s not exactly a short walk, and if you plan on actually walking down to the beach area you’re going to wish you can comfortable shoes. Also make sure you have some cash. There are places to purchase water and snacks along the way, and you might need both after climbing the steps in the sun. Overall, amazing...breathtaking...don’t miss this. "
Teodora,"Bucharest, Romania",Oct 2019,Better off seeing the pictures from Instagram. The road there is very bumpy and dusty... would go again to Nusa Penida...
Larushca F,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2019,"This is one of the most beautiful places to see on nusa penida, it truly is as picture perfect as you see it on the internet. "
Bouy TorQue,"Pattaya, Thailand",Aug 2019,absolutely magical spot. It is very steep at times but slow n steady wins the race. Well worth the effort.The views will blow your mind. Great photos to be taken.
Traveler1234567890,8 contributions,Sep 2019,"The place is spectacular but the climb down to the beach is truly dangerous and takes 35min just to go down. If you plan to go down, do it well before sunset, wear proper shoes and carry enough water - and be really careful! There are some really narrow and steep sections in the trail. The views are great from the top too so you don’t miss too much if you decide to stay there :)Note that also this nature attraction has an entrance fee. "
Harry Nugraha,"Banjarmasin, Indonesia",Sep 2019,this place is totally awesome!!ride for 30' from GM Bungalows. you can use car with local guide but the road is small. 
satish k,"Hyderabad District, India",Aug 2019,"I had booked for speed boat from sanur for 3,50,000 IDR to reach Nusa Penida . The boat journey takes around 40-45 minutes and i arrived in Nusa Penida around 10 am and i rented a motorcycle for 70,000 IDR and started my ride towards Kelingking beach . First the road to reach the beach has some terrible potholes and some places there is steep slopes so its always safer to ride your motorcycles wearing helmets and also ride at decent speeds . You have to pay parking ticket once you reach the beach to park your bike . The view from the top is simply stunning . It takes almost 30 minutes to go down and its very tough if you are trying to do that around noon time in hot and humid conditions so its advisable for people who want to go down to the beach to carry lots of water to keep themselves hydrated . i was struggling with dehydration when climbing back as i didn't carry water bottle . Few tourist just take pics from the top but the real beauty is the beach if you had made all the way to the top then take that extra 2 hours and go down to the beach and have the best view ."
Fioo,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"To be honest, this beach is one of the best beaches i’ve ever visited. Kelingking beach has a super beautiful view with white sands. You guys definitely use sneakers to hike down, because the path is too steep. I don’t recommend you bringing children or parents as cliff very dangerous. And you need to be healthy. Don’t forget to bring much water. Five stars for Kelingking Beach!"
Tim,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Sep 2019,"One word for this spot, FABULOUS!It’s possible to go down all the way to the beach. Approximately 30 minutes down and 60 up again. Be there early to avoid the massive crowds."
Natasha U,6 contributions,Sep 2019,"Usually crowed! but if you have a tour guide they just know what to do, just give them your camera  😊 There are restaurants/cafes close by so you can spend a good amount of time there or maybe catch a sunrise here...the beach is just as magical"
Joyce Van der Auwera,"Tremelo, Belgium",Sep 2019,"It was an amazing view! You have to walk a little bit higher and further away from all the tourist and you have an amazing silence view! You can walk down too a very nice beach! We didn't do it because there was a line to get down.. You have to go early! Friends off us did it, it would be a 30 min walk. Also would recommend to go from a boat and take a tour around the island then you can see tis rock as a T-rex very awesome! "
Sebastian,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"It was fun, worth going down and climbing up. The beach is literally the most beautiful one i've ever visited.Feels like having a leg day.Go for a swim there. Its so refreshing"
putuhariw,6 contributions,Sep 2019,I recommend this to be your trip.The service is very satisfying.This is the wonder of the world.enjoyy
travellorandy,"Mainz, Germany",Oct 2018,"Although it was a bit crowdy, it was an awesome experience and adventure. The trail to the Beach might be a bit dangerous but its definitily worth it."
taggmontreal,"Tucson, AZ",Sep 2019,A must see if you are visiting Nusa Penida. Just be careful when there’s lots of people could be dangerous. I didn’t do the hike down to beach as it’s 2 hrs up and down with very steep steps. 
Jillian B,"Victoria, Canada",May 2019,"To start, go early... like seriously the crowds are extreme and I get it. It was magical place but the hike itself is quite treacherous!! Now not everyone at the top goes down (1 blessing) most turn around once they have snapped their shot and go back up... but if you're going all the way to the bottom, go early in the day!** PLLLLLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, don't do this in your flip flops or your cute little instagram worthy wedges. We saw you, you looked cute but hell its not worth falling off a cliff for!I would advise against this if you have any fear of heights. One of the girls in our party was and the trip back up was even harder than the way down. We even picked up an extra in our group when a girl started to panic and her friends left her. The path is super narrow (passing is not always an option). its not flat and well ""groomed"", this is Bali not Hawaii! I mean I was impressed with the handrails they had half the way down, until they stopped and the original ones that don't hold a fly started again. I 100% think it was worth it but as long as you know what you are signing up for, but I don't think it would be worth the another trip back down. I don't feel like testing out my medical insurance. Now the beach, the beach is absolutely gorgeous and I'm a strong swimmer but even that was deceiving. So if you aren't a confident swimmer, don't go in... again your on vacation stay happy and safe!"
AmigaSL,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Sep 2019,Amazing view. Bit dangerous. Make sure to wear shoes. Dusty. Highly recommended place to visit in Bali Nusa Penida.
MJL,"Brooklyn, NY",Sep 2019,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn. Beautiful as it is, this attraction is going to make headlines for all the wrong reasons if responsible action is not taken soon."
Diana Klimova,"Kyiv (Kiev), Ukraine",Aug 2019,Very nice place to see - ocean & view are breathtaking! Highly recommended place to visit! Just be aware - it’s very crowded place & monkeys are hiding around so keep eye on your belongings. 
combat_wombat86,"High Wycombe, UK",Sep 2019,"Our tour guide bought us here - of course we were familiar with its image on Instagram already but also knew about the dangerous hike down.Few photos, couple of temples and the odd monkey. That path down though - I’m scared of falling so hated seeing the edge or my wife near the edge.  I chickened out early but I’m sure the climb down would be worth the climb up.We walked round to the other headland where you can take yet more photos if you have the time Worth going to - shame so many of us tourists are around to spoil the view!!"
valerie k,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"It was the hardest descent I’ve ever had, and I was wearing a dress (bad decision) but the beach is so amazing. You should go down if you go here, I personally recommend you to spend a day here, and go back up after sunset "
Ezra I F,"Bontang, Indonesia",Sep 2019,"I cannot say enough about the spectacular view of this place. Even from one place to other is hard to reach, the view is worthed it.Did not try to go to the beach but from above it is look really clean. Too much tourist and people taking photo make this place less natural I think."
Andrea,6 contributions,Sep 2019,Amazing experience. The beach and the way down was so worth it. Be careful though. And wear comfortable shoes. 
Anupam S,47 contributions,Sep 2019,Went to the beach in the evening. It was more than beautiful. Couldn’t go down to beach as we didn’t have much time. But the view from top is awesome. Endless blue water and crystal clear white sand beaches. But was little crowded due to people busy clicking selfies and photo. Nevertheless one should definitely visit. Just be wary of the roads.
Martijn89,"Hulst, The Netherlands",Sep 2019,"It’s a beauty, it truly is. But to be honest; it’s better on photos. It is so busy that it’s hard to find a good spot to enjoy the view. And a true magnet for insta-photographers trying to add an “original” selfie to their album. Coming early really pays off. Soms restaurants and toilets nearby, nothing really special or clean. Fee to get in was 5000 idr per vehicle which is cheap, but make sure you have it on you. "
chins01,"Brooklyn, NY",Aug 2019,The view was beautiful but I'd recommend going somewhere else as the island has a lot of beautiful views and beaches. When we went there were hoards of people who came purely to take instagram photos and not to enjoy the actual location.  It was so crowded with people posing for photos you could barely walk. We ended up leaving quickly and heading to a different beach instead.
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"We went to Kelingking as part of one day tour to Nusa Penida Island so we had limited time for this place unfortunately. I would have rather skipped cristal Bay and stayed for a swim here, however the tour guys have organized the trip in a different way.You do need half an hour maybe to reach the beach down and half and hour to go up. But it’s worth it for sure!!! "
Raimonds R,"Riga, Latvia",Sep 2019,"Very nice beach for making photos. Rock, stone, some sandy parts. Country roads with pits leads to this beach. Roads under construction in many places. No dislikes. Liked everything."
Charlie W,"Bundaberg, Australia",Aug 2019,"This view is insane. Just as it is seen on Instagram the view is incredible. There was quite a few people but it didn’t stop anyone from taking any photos and there was no queuing.Some people were waiting to get down to the beach, but the view is what you must come for. It takes a while to get here because the roads are too narrow for 2 way traffic, so plan to have enough time."
Natalie C,"Hinckley, UK",Aug 2019,"Advise going earlier to this location as it can get very busy but it was a beautiful view and people were generally very patient, even with a friend that was quite afraid of heights taking her time going down the stairs. "
Sam B,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,Beautiful spot. Make sure to look at the surrounds as well as the main attraction.The road into any Penida attraction is really rough so be prepared but it's lovely
Em23,"Essex, UK",Aug 2019,"Be warned this place is hard to get too only come by scooter if you are experienced with hills and turns, lots of pot holes ect we saw 4 separate accidents on the way people with bleeding legs, fallen off the bikes The views are stunning didn’t hike down as there were 100000’s of people taking photos making it unsafe as they have no idea what’s going on around them and could easily make you feel uneasyLots and lots of restaurants I believe they all only take cash It’s more expensive up there 15,000 for water 30,000 for ice cream 5,000 entrance / parking fee Stunning views very busy!!!Around an hour from nusa penida harbour to here and It’s another 30 minutes drive roughly to Angel’s billabong afterwards with even worse horrendous roads and for long stretches."
han5da,"Leoben, Austria",Aug 2019,Crazy as hell when the the people start shouting at each other because they want to take a photo. The beach is amazing but tourism is going to destroy everything near this breathtaking location
Rose Kuruvilla,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,"This is probably my favourite view of a beach in Nusa Penida. It is shaped like a t-rex. To take photos, your guide will offer to climb a tree to snap a shot of you and the beach. Simply stunning. We didn't get to go down to the beach as we had a 2 year old and the hike down is difficult. So we just enjoyed the view from the top."
Varghese N,"Kochi (Cochin), India",Jul 2019,"Blue sea with giant fish tail like island Recommend to spend a whole day in this island, 1 hour trekking down and up each, take some food and drink Goethe day when you go down, extremely clear water and beautiful sun set "
aries_92,"Bournemouth, UK",Aug 2019,"Very beautiful destination to visit but just prayed on tourists. There’s restaurants and ice cream shops all over the place which kind of takes away the beauty and natural feel to this place. I understand that Balinese people are going to make the most of tourists here, but it just wasn’t what I was expecting. You are charged for everything, parking/photos/toilets etc. We didn’t do the walk down to the beach as it was too busy. But looked beautiful. We watched manta rays from the cliff which was amazing. "
Laurent B,"Le Tremblay-sur-Mauldre, France",Aug 2019,Incredible view... And the gift : monkeys... But it's not so easy.Never try to swim here... It's to dangerous due to hudge current.
catrine law,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2019,"amazing trip while in Asia, an unspoiled place with beautiful scenery, don't forget to visit this place if you visit nusa penida.100% I recommend."
loveylavazza,"Padangbai, Indonesia",Aug 2019,Definitely worth seeing. Very beautiful coastline. Can pay 50c each and go to look out for best views and photos. The road to the beauty spots was terrible. Not tarred and very corrugated rough road
Inge R,"Mechelen, Belgium",Aug 2019,"Pretty sight... if you are willing to stand between 100's of tourists, just for a pretty picture. Don't go there, spend your time somewhere else and look up the picture on instagram, there must be plenty of them..."
Viviana Marin B,44 contributions,Aug 2019,One of the beautiful and unique places of Nusa Penida. The view is gorgeous. If you really want to go down you will have to be prepared physically because it is not for everyone. The way up and down can be hard. So it can take time. But if you decide to stay up the view makes the visit more then worthwhile. 
jamesbolton,2 contributions,Aug 2019,great viewpoint. I recommend to go early in the morning before it gets too bussy and specially if you want to go down to the beach
Inwanderment,"Leamington Spa, UK",Aug 2019,So many steps!!!! We went down one flight and then skipped the others haha! But the view is beautiful and you can get some amazing photos from the top :) 
Audrey C,6 contributions,Aug 2019,"The hike is not for the faint-hearted, but the beach once you get down is a million times worth it! The most beautiful beach I have ever encountered, we were greeted by huge waves and just an absolutely unbelievable location. An absolute must if you are on the island and fit enough to complete the hike. "
Daniel W,30 contributions,Aug 2019,"Yes the view is amazing... BUT ... this place is very very dangerous. You have 100s of people on one thin path along the edge of the cliff.  There is only a makeshift wooden fence tied together with string to stop you from falling.  I would not recommend going.  It's terrible that people are willing to take more and more tourists every day, but nobody is willing to take action to make the place safe for people.  In addition there are monkeys up there running free which isn't ideal when you are so near to cliff edge."
Billie_Gin,"Athens, Greece",Aug 2019,A perfect view - crystal clear waters and white sand. If you want you can go to beach (downstairs 45 minutes upstair 1+ hour). The stairs were extremely busy but this is to be expected at such a popular attraction. Many people and tour guides who takes them pictures.
Lina robert,"London, UK",Aug 2019,"the best tourist destinations in Asia that I have visited after Thailand and Japan. There are still many other places that I have not visited, according to the beach or the information is also quite good and worth a visit"
Thubelihle N,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2019,"Perfect. I enjoyed the hike down took about 45 min it can be less if you fast. And coming back up took 20, the view is majestically. Really loved it very advisable just wear good shoes for good grip coz it’s steep and a Lil slippery "
Inspiration607193,3 contributions,Aug 2019,"A stunning view - crystal clear waters and white sand. The stairs were extremely busy but this is to be expected at such a popular attraction. Also, the area is good for monkey watching if that’s your thing! Lots of Warungs to eat also. "
mickl,Germany,Aug 2019,"a natural and beautiful place, like living in heaven, you can go down to relax accompanied by the waves and the sun"
Paulina Perrucci,"Los Gatos, CA",Jul 2019,"I thought getting there at 9:30am would have been ideal, but there were so many people.  It is one narrow little path way to a stunning view point. You can even see people walking on the beach.  Since it is right by the island port, it's a very popular tourist attraction.  I would say go early in the morning."
JKain21,"Orewa, New Zealand",Aug 2019,"Such a beautiful beach! We visited as a part of a tour and I wish we had just made a day of this so we could have made the hike down to the beach, our guide told us it was 45mins down and 1.5hours back up. We got to see dolphins and Manta Rays swim past, so cool! The only sad thing is the road to get here, it very dumpy and I would not recommend using a scooter especially with 2 people. They definitely have set the island up for tourism. "
SabySG,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2019,"I've been hearing so many things about Nusa Penida that I decided to give it a try, but I'm really not sure why everyone is so excited about this, it's overcrowded wherever you go and you have to pay to just enjoy the view, e.g. for Kelingking, which is a total rip off. The road there is super bumpy and it's a long ride, and at the end you have to queue to take a picture - ridiculous! Will not go back and don't recommend it. I really don't know why people make such a fuss about it, I think it's not worth it - stay away! Also, it's super dirty, lots of plastic everywhere you go. Sad."
Loekito1824,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Must visit place when go to Nusa Penida. You won't be disappointed with the view. Great Place to take picture too. Regardless the road is very bumpy and quite far from the jetty, it's worth your effort. If you have much time you can walk down to the beach, need around 45mins to go down. However the path is not good and quite steep. You have to walk slowly to avoid any injuries. It's a great experience if you have time to go down, because according to the local guide this beach if the best beach at Nusa Penida. The water is clear and the sand is not rough."
storm s,37 contributions,Aug 2019,"We were taken away by this beautiful t Rex shaped beach in Bali. The beautiful sand,  clear blue waters and mantas made it an incredible experience. Water gets deep quickly, with big waves and current - perfect if you love body surfing.  Beware!  Getting to this beach is not for the faint hearted and requires a decent level of fitness to get up and down - as the track is underdeveloped and some places you need to rock climb to get back up. Well worth it though!"
Khaulah Naadiya,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jul 2019,"The view of Kelingking from above is amazing. It’s getting better once you go down and play in the beach. The water is so blue and there isn’t that many people since the way to go down is quite extreme. There are spots where you only have a space for ur feet so i think its better to go there in pair or ask people on the way for help. Going up from the beach is another story, its practically rock climb. But its all worth the pain!"
emma,World,Aug 2019,"The road to kelingking by motor or car is rough anyways, I can say that 70% of the road was fine and the rest was unpaved rough road. The scene is definitely very beautiful, simply amazing. From the top you can see amazing views of the beach and you can even spot manta ray fish, we could see at least 4. Then we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so we can swim in beautiful turquoise sea and play in the white soft sand. However, there was almost no stairs, it was more similar to climbing a rocky mountain, it was very steep, long, and challenging. Wearing a shoe for this hike is a must. The first half of the broken stairs was fine but the other half was definitely harder, no stairs, only broken rocks to step on. I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs. After finally reaching the bottom, it was all still beautiful, but the sea was also rough, high waves and strong tide, so it was hard to relax in the sea. In the beach there was only one small place selling some drinks and snacks. Overall, it was definitely very beautiful, the view and scene was amazing. The challenge is a bit hard but worth it and we all felt great after doing all this. I would give it 5 stars if only it was better maintained (stairs and facilities) considering the amount of tourists that come to this place. Otherwise its beautiful."
Heena Kapoor,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2019,"The place is located in 'Nusa Penida', an island almost 45 minutes from Bali via sea route. The water is three brilliant shades of blue... The beach is absolutely beautiful!"
nailaatikkhan,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jun 2019,"The views of Kelingking from the top are amazing. But it can be really busy at points, which takes away from the tranquility. You will be surrounded by lots of people taking photos and dangling over the edge for the shot, which can get a little unsafe. The beach is not easily accessible."
Pioneer826629,"Madrid, Spain",May 2019,I came here with my boyfriend and we found it amazing. I would say it is a bit dangerous for children but if you are adventurous this is your dream beach.
krys_k,"London, UK",Jul 2019,"Great view from the whatever angle you look at it. One thing that I learnt from 6 days on Nusa Penida is that if you want to see anything without crowds you need to head of in the morning, preferably as the sun rises whilst folks are having breakfast. The alternative, as it was here, is to battle through traffic jams (on a small island!), and encounter queues (to get onto the track down to the beach). The area on approach to the entrance is too built up with business, some blaring out max volume Beyoncé (I’m sure that even Beyoncé wouldn’t agree). However, walking up the cliffs means you loose the crowds and get some fantastic views pretty much to yourselves. "
vancitykelsey,"Vancouver, Canada",Aug 2019,"Absolutely breathtaking views that were amazing! It is extremely busy with tourists and the drive up the mountain is quite windy, but it is not to be missed. If you're coming to nusa penida I would highly highly highly recommend that you do not take a scooter. The roads are extremely bumpy narrow and even an experienced scooter driver would have trouble navigating the thin, steep, uneven roads. The number of tourists that I seen with completely scraped up legs arms limbs, literally bloody from accidents was unbelievable. Take the safer route drive up the mountain with experience locals in an AC car. Honestly these views were something that took my breath away it was so unbelievably beautiful. Taking a picture here makes you look like a professional photographer without even using any filter, Etc. That is how beautiful this place really is!"
DaHappyCat,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"The lookout spot you see in all the typical photos is about a 4 minute walk from the carpark. If you have a tour guide / driver they will be happy to take all the photos for you. They even climb trees to get the best angles. On the day I went we waited about 5-10 minutes to get our photo, but assume on super busy day (or in a couple of years when it gets more popular) it will end up taking a long time to get the photos. You can walk down the stairs to get to beach as well."
Stuart D,"Birmingham, UK",Jul 2019,Amazing beach .... it's a long way down (cold take 45mins down the steps) but amazing experience. highly recommended
Juan Juanes,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2019,"Beach and view was amazing.It was bit adventures to get in to the beach from top. But we did it !!!Spend time enjoying, great time. one of best experience we had in our holiday in Bali !"
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,"No words to describe this place...just serenity at its best...The beaches in Nusa penida are so unique,you cannot miss anyone of them. Do visit and enjoy .The trek to Trex is quite tough,only for daredevils...but the green turquoise color of water just makes your travel memory set apart."
Umang A,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2018,The view from the top is amazing here and you see the t rex head. Walk is difficult and suggest to avoid flipflops.
Seema,"Pokhara, Nepal",Jul 2019,You have to take a cruise to Nusa Panida to see this place. It is very nice- different kinda of beach I have ever been to. I was told takes 2 hours to get down and back up. We took picture from up as we did not had much time. 
Darcy Gomas,"Paris, France",Jun 2019,It was an amazing experience during our holiday in Bali. Island and scenery was so nice. We had a great time. My kids enjoyed a lot. Recommended for families and all type of visitors.
Aswad Miah,"London, UK",Sep 2018,"I would recommend anyone to have Nusa Penida Island tour as a must day trip activity if you visit Bali. The whole Island is amazing however, when we visited it was a little bit overcrowded. "
Franko A,"Acapulco, Mexico",Jul 2019,The view is incredibly amazing in every spot but the path to get down to the beach is very dangerous and it takes a long time to get out of it.  
H M,84 contributions,Jul 2019,"We were staying in Seminyak when we took a day trip to Nusa Penida. It was easy to get around with a driver, but getting from one place to another takes a long time. We were able to go to 3-4 places on the island, and Kelingking was one of them. It’s better in person than in pictures... the colors of the water are incredible. But there were a lot of people at the top taking pictures, pretty much from the same spot. Some people climb down, but the way down is not the safest/easiest."
Ryan,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jun 2019,"Keling king beach is as crazy beautiful as any of these photos show. It's rather crowded, with everyone trying to get a good Instagram photo (as much of Bali is these days) but it's still off the radar of most travelers. And the rest of the island is even more so - most people still visit for a day trip. And that's their loss. Nusa Penida lacks the amenities and entertainment of Bali, but it puts Bali's beaches to shame. Absolutely great for hiking, sight seeing, and quiet relaxation. I strongly suggest staying on Penida and touring the island for a few days. Just be careful getting around as the roads are in dire shape."
Zahra Prem Akasha,"Paris, France",Jul 2019,Its a wonderful and magic view... be carful with the stairs but to visit absolutely if you go to Penida 
Mochamad Dwi Ergianto,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"This one is my favourite beach all around Bali. Not so many people try to go down to the beach, the track is quiet hard and long (10-20 minutes)."
Inga029,"Vilnius County, Lithuania",Jul 2019,"We really enjoyed the view, but it was very crowded. If you want to go down it’s not the easy path. So we ended up just viewing from top. "
Nishadi L,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",May 2019,Beautiful views and great photo opps but if you want to get the beach (climb down heaps of stairs) you’ll have to wait a while because this location is always so crowded. I preferred the east coast of nusa penida because there were less people (especially if you go there early) and you could have the beach almost all to yourself 
Rahmat,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",Jul 2019,Kelingking beach one of the place recommended to visit. Even far from Bali but Everything is paid after you be there.
Miriam V,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2019,"Went to see this spectacular view because it’s so known. Did not disappoint! Just had about 20 minutes since we only had one day to do sightseeing on Nusa Penida, so we only got to see it from the top. Used my drone to capture some great pictures, so it was fine in the end. The roads to get to this place is awful, the road is really bumpy and takes about an hour from the harbour- but in the end the view is worth it. Crowded, so would recommend you come early. "
Ashakani,"Chennai (Madras), India",May 2019,The road to this beach is very bad.four wheeler is better idea to go there.the upper view of the beach is spectacular.we can go down the main Beach area for feeling the water but it's a 45min hike down
Matt C,"Bury St. Edmunds, UK",Jul 2019,"View aside, the journey just to get there is quite something. Not for the faint hearted if driving round blind bends is not your thingBut be assured once you arrive it's unlikely you'll have seen anything quite like this place Very very busy and the route down to the beach is tight and equally as busyKeep an eye out for the monkeys too!!"
Stephanie M,"Belfast, UK",Jul 2019,"This view is amazing! We even saw manta rays! We didn’t go down the steps to the beach though because it was far too busy and no one was actually moving on the steps! The roads to get to it are difficult to ride a moped on, and I assume a car would be very bumpy too! But the view was worth it in the end!"
Joe M,160 contributions,Jun 2019,"take the famous instagram and facebook shot here in kelingking beach. With several walk from the parking area, you can already pose in the famous scene. if you have time, do take a quick tracking down the cliff. worth the time and penny. catch the sunset here and leave memories behind. "
Chris H,"Bournemouth, UK",Jul 2019,"Nusa Penida as an island is beautiful, Kelingking Beach is something else. The most mesmerising place I have ever visited. The height of the cliffs, crossed with the sculpture of the land and that blue ocean just creates the most perfect view. We stood and watched as Mantra Rays swam just off of the beach. Simple perfect I would travel to the island again just to see this!"
Irma Andyana,"Pontianak, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"it's in Nusa Penida Island near Bali.worth to visit when in Bali. Great view, fresh air, and new experience. but you have to queue to take the photo haha. if you traveling with tour guide he will help you take the pic. I didn't go down to the beach, but i will love to someday."
Rickard L,"Kungalv, Sweden",Jul 2019,Perfect postcard photos 😊They have restaurants and toilets so all you need is cash (no one takes card!)
raidzwan,"Johor Bahru, Malaysia",Jul 2019,"-choose either package or by yourself -i doit myself-gojek from hotel kuta to sanur-buy return boat sanur-penida at idr300k-rent motorcycle at idr80k-parking for all place +- (idr 30k)-lunch at sebuluh restaurant (+- idr 100k) 1personBumpy road,small road,but great view"
Ansu Thankam J,"Vellore, India",Jul 2019,"Kelingking beach was our first destination in Nusa penida.It was quite a long journey from the harbour.We were greeted by a very cheerful guide.We reached the cliff top.There's very clean tea shop on the top, provides great tea and snacks, clean restrooms were available. The view from top is breathtaking. We clicked pics. We trekked down to the beach. However the trek was very steep and dangerous,we realized that only half way through and it was too late to climb back up. It's literally rock climbing,so be ready for a proper trek. I would advise against taking kids along. Anyhow what lies beneath is worth the trouble. We had packed some granola bars and juice packets which saved the energy to climb back. It was near noon and was too sunny and terribly hot. Thinking back now we felt it was not a safe idea,a good adventure,a great memory."
fayemurphy,"Cork, Ireland",Jun 2019,"We arrived here at approximately 9am and were one of the first groups there. By the time we left, 45 minutes later, there were significantly more tourists, already making it difficult to enjoy the beauty of the place without an elbow in the face. Members of our group weren't keen on walking all the way down to the beach but I did go some of the way down and deeply regret not going all the way. I think it is something extremely worthwhile and doesn't seem very treacherous to do. Good walking shoes are an essential if going all the way down though and I would imagine it is not very suitable for young children as it can get very steep. Also, beware of your valuables as there are monkeys wandering around!"
DaJanss,"Sanur, Indonesia",Jul 2019,"nice to make a trip and to snorkel. If you visit the island, it's a must to snorkel to see the beautiful underwater life.One disadvantage: so popular, that it feels overcrowded by tourists"
Nusa Penida Tour,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Jul 2019,Kelingking beach located in west nusa penida need 45 minute from banjar nyuh port. But the view workit and amazing. If you go to nusa penida you must visit this place❤️
erika p,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2019,"Nusa Penida is a relatively undeveloped tourist destination, therefore roads and other facilities are in their infancy and are struggling to satisfy the needs of tourists. However the unspoilt scenery, friendly locals and spectacular sights make it worthwhile. Careful management is required to retain the rugged attractions and make access safe. Doing your homework of any place one visits is a MUST to avoid drawing inappropriate conclusions."
Jaster N,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,It's a must visit beach when you are in Nusa Penida. We went in the late afternoon by scooter and it wasn't crowd. Hiking down seriously not for the weak hearts! The roads indeed not for beginner riders. Way too bumpy and rocky but it's definitely worth it!
DiianEviita,"Kuta, Indonesia",Jul 2019,So beautiful beach..and i hope this beach still be a recomend beach in bali.because i love bali  .. Always love my born place
Mohammed M,"Manama, Bahrain",Jul 2019,"We’ve reached this location after a horrendous boat ride with waves pounding the boat. Reaching to Kelingking beach required a tiring 40 minutes ride on semi-paved roads. The scene is breath taking. But overall all, I don’t think it’s worth it. The tours also include other beaches/cliffs with the same bumpy ride that will drain you for the day. I’ve wasted my time (and money) to be honest."
Susie B,"Rolleston, New Zealand",Jun 2019,Visited this beach after enduring a boat ride that had to be boarded on the beach. With the waves pounding the beach it was quite a scary encounter to get on board. To get to the beach we had a driver who took us over some horrendous roads that caused me to have a sore back for several weeks. When we got there to view the beach it was loverly but as usual crowded with lots of people. I definitely wouldn’t be going back. I felt sorry for the people who hired scooters. The roads were bad enough in the car.  The roads were horrendous all over the island. Not what I would call a pleasant visit. The boat trip going back we had to get off the boat at the beach with the same difficulty. 
MasterJohn316_,1 contribution,Jul 2019,Beautiful scenery! My guides Ketut putra & gd maha were exceptional! Couldn’t ask for anyone better.
Aakila Ayman Mohamed Ismail,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,Kelingking Beach is the main highlight in Nusa Penida. It was the most awesome beached I have ever been. Be extra careful if you decide to trek down the cliff.
tacaram,Brisbane,Jun 2019,The pictures really don't do this place justice.  The view is beautiful.  We didn't walk/climb all the way down to the beach but did manage to go part way to appreciate the amazing scenery.  It does get busy/popular but you can still get chance for photos and to appreciate the views. Recommend sturdy shoes if you are going to climb down to the beach - the walk is more like trekking/rock climbing at times.
Luciano D,"Buenos Aires, Argentina",May 2019,"please go down to the beach, totally worth it. It takes way too long (about 40 minutes) to go down and another 40 minutes to go up mainly because of the people and the very narrow pass. And of course save keep some hours to enjoy the beach. Best place in all west Nusa"
Zbenda,"Sydney, Australia",May 2019,"The best experience of our holiday in Bali. You have to have a good condition because access is quite hard. But it’s amazing. Don’t be lazy, take your time and go down. But be careful! "
Colleen,"Toronto, Canada",Apr 2019,"Although there is quite a journey to get here from mainland Bali, a car, a boat, a tuc-tuc, a car....a very broken beat up road and then paradise! So worth it. Breathtaking views, stunning blue ocean. Pictures do not do this place justice."
samchy,"Birmingham, UK",Jun 2019,"This place is beautiful, words can’t describe it. Great for walking, scenaries like in movies and most of all fun. The locals are really friendly and I am so glad I visited it. Be wary the roads in Nusa Panida are quite bad though and a lot of bumps and journey can be uncomfortable but it’s well worth it. "
Chen Wei Li,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Visit this place by yourself and be amaze 😄 ..cheap entrance ticket only 5k idr per person, although the roadtrip to this place might be extreme for several person but when you arrive there, all r worth it"
samantha,10 contributions,Jul 2019,Our guide Maha was amazing! He used our camera better than we could to get some epic pictures. The roads were a bit rough but the driver did an excellent job and the time at the swimming beach was great. Overall I couldn’t recommend this tour enough!
Lidya Setiawati,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"It was very beautiful beach, nice view with the blue ocean. To reach the Kelingking Beach, it has to go down the cliff. Must be careful because it is very steep and slippery. It takes time about 40 minutes. But the struggles paid off when get down, because the beach is very nice."
Sadicay,257 contributions,Jun 2019,"Another beautiful view, the T rex like formation is one of a kind.The crowd is starting to pour when we came, but still able to get few decent photos.We didnt go down and just enjoyed the view from the top. There are some tourists swimming. Per our tour guide is 20 mins hike down, but going up may take longer depending on the person.For those who wanted to go down and swim, day tour is not enough."
Francesca S,43 contributions,Jun 2019,Go early as the busloads of tourists arrive around 9am. The walk down is a bit intimidating but the views are incredible. You can see mantas down below in the clear water.
suvi1983,111 contributions,Jun 2019,"We visited the Klingking beach first straight after getting off the ferry from Sanur to Nusa Penida. It was noon when we reached the beach and it was HOT. But the view was as breathtaking as one would hope. Stunning!! The view was way better than any of the Instagram pictures I had seen. We probable spent about 30 minutes there taking pictures and then went to our next destination. Be sure to wear comfortable footwear as the roads are definitely not walkable in heels ladies!! You don't need shoes, just any comfortable footwear ought to do."
Drey Liautaud,1 contribution,Jun 2019,"This was a phenomenal experience, the photos will be excellent and your insta pic will be poppin. But understand that the hike is no piece of cake so come prepared with the right footwear and know your limits. If you haven’t done strenuous physical activity in awhile it might not be for you. It’s a lot of climbing and oftentimes you are almost vertical. Unprepared travelers put everyone at risk given the way the track down is structured at points."
Nathalie DW,"Saint Nicolas, Belgium",May 2019,"must visit when on Nusa Penida !  be careful when taking scooter, the road is tricky to drive ! And in the meantime the place is overrun with day trippers from Bali but still too beautiful to be missed."
Sumedh Shinde,"Pune, India",Jun 2019,The tour is one of the best ones. The island has its own beauty. Our guide Mr. Manku Su was a very nice person and highly recommend to go with him. 
steve p,"Nottinghamshire, UK",Jun 2019,"The view from the top is amazing, the view from the beach is equally nice but it's just another blue sea photo from the beach really. If you plan to go to the beach please heed the other reviews that recommend decent footwear and clothing and a certain level of physical fitness. It's hard going, especially on the way up...and please take your rubbish with you, unlike the Brazilian/ Portugese couple today that just threw their plastic bottle into the undergrowth when the going got too tough for their Instagram clothing, make up and flip flops....people like you are a disgrace, give tourists a bad name, and are a danger to others in places like this! "
thewees,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,"So after going one time and not knowing what to expect, this is our tips if we were to do it again.Pack a small backpack so you can have your fitflops with you when you hike down to the beach. It’s v difficult to do the trail without proper shoes.In the small backpack, we plan to pack some snacks a beach towel plus some water and even beer if the bag isn’t too heavy!The beach looked so secluded and beautiful from above so I think it’s definitely worth a climb down. Pencil in the whole day to enjoy this place if you already are exhausting all your energy climbing down. Everyone stops at the top for photos only so if that’s all you plan to do, go early!We took the tour from Nusa Island Surf School who organised a 7am departure from Nusa Lembongan on boat then to a car once we got to Nusa Penida. We got to Kelingkling beach before 9am, by 10, it was non stop tourist traffic.There are small warungs there so easy to buy water food and beer as well.Have a great time! It’s an absolute must to see this place :)"
Prothu,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",May 2019,"Me and my husband went there to celebrate our marriage  anniversary.The place is amazing. View is just awesome. The turquoise water attracted both of us and we couldn't hold ourself getting down the beach. It was very risky to go down, very stiff and narrow path. However we went down there and it took about 1 hour. After getting down there you will feel that yes the effort comming down worth it. The big waves and white sands are mind blowing.As the waves were big i didn't dive into but my husband went for swim. Unfortunately i was just standing nearby and feeling the waves touching my feets, suddenly a very stong wave came and just made me fall down. I was not able to getup and within a fraction of second it took me away deep.I thought i was dead. My husband came to fetch me but along with me he was also drowning. Thanks to the other foreign visitors those helped both of us from being drowned. 4 of them dragged both of us simultaneously. It was so dangerous and i was very scared. I'll never forget this accident. So guys please dont swim in high tides not even stand nearby the waves.Thanks to Almighty for saving both of us.Then all of them encouraged us and half an hour later we decided to climb up. It took 1.5 hours to climb up and was too sunny. Very hard to climp up, no shadows , no place to take rest. But the place was really very beautiful. A must visit in Nusa Penida. Suggestions:1. Pls wear sneakers /slippers whatever you feel comfort. We went down there with slipper.2. Hat/Cap3. Plenty of water bottles. Down there 1 500 ml bottle is 30 k IDR4. Chocolate / dry foods5.Dont dive into the sea. "
David C,"Antwerp, Belgium",Jun 2019,"Prepare yourself for a serious climb down to the beach! And allthough  you want to wear slippers, because you’re going to the beach, we were glad we brought our hiking shoes for the ‘stairs’ downwards. Halfway down the way, people are turning back, because things get tricky. As a result you will spend your time at the beach with only few people, making the experience even better... don’t think you can take a swim to cool down, cause the waves will drag you right in the water...For those who dare to take on the challenge: enjoy your view!!!"
Emelie J,21 contributions,Jun 2019,"We had the best guide going down, I have astma so needed stop several Times but my other half and guide was so patience with me ☺️ best guide ever, I recommend jpctours on instagram, contact him there. Safe and good👌 been too Bali two Times ☺️"
Sweta T,bangalore,Apr 2019,this is a beautiful beach with lime stone cliffs in shape of Trex head.nice place. but crowded with tourist.to go to sea one need to climb down a steep way.  
Canadian,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"Honestly, 100 times better if you go while staying on the island and not as a day trip. We arrived around 9 am. Paid 11,000 per two people (including parking scooter)There were only a dozen or so people. Plenty of space to enjoy the view and take pictures. We decided to take the grueling stairs down- I'm not going to lie it is steep! But a nice challenge, if you are looking for a good work out it's worth it. But once we got down we weren't sure the point of heading down. The beach is nice, but you can't swim. So we didn't really see the point of going down in the end. We returned to the top around 11am and there were TONS of people. It was insane, basically a line to get to the edge to take a picture. Coming back up was also brutal but only because there were so many people on the stairs. Overall take home message for us, go in the morning and don't bother with the way down. FYI there are also two other view points further down the road and again no one was there."
Kasia M,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2019,The beach is not easily accessible (we drove a motorbike for 40 minutes from the main Port) but the views are definitely worth the hustle! Unfortunately number of people pushing through the narrow path to get this “original” Instagram picture makes it very difficult to enjoy. We tried to walk down the path but it was too packed to really take to most out of it - I would recommend to go there very early in the morning to avoid the crowds 
Willwork4holiday,111 contributions,Jun 2019,"Having left from Sanur harbour we boarded the fast boat from the beach, you have to wade in up to your thighs to board the back of boat, the trip was smooth and fast with every seat filled on boat.  After about 45 mins we arrived at Nusa Penida, this was onto a proper harbour wall so didn’t get wet getting off the boat.  We did some snorkelling at Crystal Bay, Gammet Bay and GT wall in a local fisherman outrigger boat.We then got into a 4wd for a lunch stop and drove the long windy road with some of it rough, potholed and unsealed to Klingking beach.  The view makes it all worth while.  Very popular with tourists. It is then back on the unsealed road about an hour drive to Nusa Penida harbour for the 45 min fast boat back to Sanur.  A long day but great tour. "
Taylor,"Southend-on-Sea, UK",Jun 2019,"We travelled 3 boats just to come to this view, and we are so glad we did. We were blessed with an amazing sunset too. We went in the evening so it would be less busy, however where the sun was setting we were unable to hike to the bottom. Many people were coming back up but seemed quite tired and it looked steep, flip flops wouldn’t be ideal. Well worth the trip for the amazing view."
ramcinty,4 contributions,Jun 2019,"Beautiful hike! Was VERY concerned for safety of some hikers. A few tips:1) no flip flops2) carry water in pack (not in hands, you'll need those)3) yell ""rock"" if one comes loose and falls- keeps those below you safe4) this climb is wildly steep, with some class four scrambles and class five climbing."
Chandré B,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jun 2019,"Getting to Kelingking Beach is not easy. Although the road is being fixed, it is a difficult ride on a scooter if you are not used to driving on rough terrain. The entrance fee once you get there is 5000 IRP per person and 1000 for a scooter. You can take pictures from the the top without the climb. If you decide to descend, be prepared for a difficult climb. We arrived in sandals, and ended up going barefoot instead. Going back you need to use your hands to climb back up. My husband and I are fit, and the 800m ascent back to the top took us just under 30min. The views, and the beach itself, are worth every drop of sweat to get there and back. It really is beautiful and unique. "
Scrumpet,Australia,Jun 2019,"Good luck trying to get past the hoards of people trying to take their selfies. We arrived around 9am and it was crazy We planned to hike halfway down but couldn't get past the people determined to take thousands of photos of themselves, so only made it a quarter of the way. The ""path"" is narrow and steep, so we gave in and hiked around to the right a little for another good view. Also, the 5000 rupiah lookout point had a decent view for those wanting some space"
Melissa V,"Lima, Peru",Jun 2019,"The place is really beautiful and the view is amazing. People can go down if they want, but they have to be really careful. The walking to go down takes 1 hour aprox. I went with my fiance and we decided just to stay on the hill. "
DCozzens,99 contributions,May 2019,"The beach on a sunny day is amazing. Getting to it can be tough, especially if you go mid day. I would strongly suggest getting there early, like sunrise. That way you won't have traffic to get there or crowds to descend with down to the beautiful beach."
Michael,"Zurich, Switzerland",Jun 2019,"Best view in Nusa Penida. The road to Kelingking Beach is one of the worst i have ever seen. Small and super bumpy. Go there early. The bad roads dont allow for much traffic and they will cause traffic congestion very fast. If you are there, simply enjoy the fantastic sea view. The dinosaur-head-shaped rock formation with the golden sand below. Just great. Absolute ""must"" for any Nusa Penida visitor!"
Ricardo Tanada,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Hello allI just have a great visit with my wife to Kelingking - Nusa Penida Island - Bali Indonesia last weekWe stayed at Coco Resort Nusa Pendia and rent a motorcycle to visit Kelingking beach at 7.00 AM.It took around 45 minutes from our hotel to reach there.. the road wasn't good, we spent almost 20 minutes in bad road conditions and finally reached the Kelingking beachThe entrance ticket for local was IDR 5.000, I'm not sure for the foreign tourist price. After parking the motorcycle and walked around 5 minutes we saw an amazing view from top of the Kelingking beach cliff. It was so beautifull, you can see the hidden paradise, clean beach, blue water, beautifull cliff (looks like dinosaurus head, some people said it looks like kelingking finger)We try to go down to the middle of the cliff, it took 15 minutes, because we wasn't have enough time, finally we decided to go back to the topOur recommendations if you want to visit the beach- Prepare at least 3 hours (30 min going down, 30 min going up and 2 hours to enjoy the water)- Wear proper shoes- Go down carefully, it was quite dangerous, some people said ""few months ago one people from Australia falldown from the cliff and died""I would like to give 5 stars for this beautiful nature in Nusa Penida Island, it was amazing!Very worth to visit, and you must see it from your own eyesPicture taken by my lovely camera Olympus OMD EM10 7-14mm lensEnjoy!"
jpglemos,"Geneva, Switzerland",Jun 2019,One of the most beautiful beaches I've seen around the world.Definitely worth seeing even if the road is rough and dangerous 
hunter_travels,9 contributions,Jun 2019,Came here with friends and was not disappointed! The view is way crazier than shown in the pictures and it is an amazing spot. Beware though if you are afraid of heights because the climb down is extremely steep and sketchy. 
Mark S,2 contributions,Jun 2019,"The best sea I have ever been to !The way down was really hard and slippery, the way up was easier. It is totally worth it"
HOLISTIC_HOPE,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"It's truly scenic words can't describe it.Choose low season as during summers it's highly crowded.One needs at least 5 or more hours from harbour to this place, vv and to go down to the beach ...."
zapumal,Singapore,Jun 2019,"It can be really crowded. Went a little early and there was no one. However, around 1030-11, a lot of people turned up. The way down to the beach is rough and poorly maintained. You will need good shoes. Also you will have to stop on the way regularly as others are stopping to take photos. However, only a few tourists go all the way down to the beach!"
wardellkate,"Lismore, Australia",May 2019,We hadn’t read anything about kelingking so had no idea that there was the hilariously steep climb. The descent was harder partially due to all the instagram photo shoots happening at the top and a flip flop wearing senior citizen who didn’t let people pass him. I would recommend going down backwards in some areas and make use of the railings/ropes where they exist.The beach at the bottom was amazing . The tide is very strong but there is also a life guard pointing out the less dangerous sections. The climb up is easier than doing down.When we got to the top there were like 10x as many people as when we had started . It seemed like hundreds of minivans had all arrived at once full of people doing day trips over from Bali. If you are staying on Nusa Penida I would ask your driver to take you there early morning or after the day trips will have finished for the day. 
Ilham H,"Machang, Malaysia",May 2019,"It's challenging to go down, more challenging to go up 😂 But, there's no regret, make sure you wear shoe or just barefoot as it's a rough way down. Don't forget to take pictures and swim there, it's worth it. Very beautiful "
jobiks,"Cairns, Australia",May 2019,The road is rough and long but the view when you get there is beautiful.  Unfortunately it is crowded and busy. There are many small restaurants that have opened to accommodate the ever increasing mass of tourists.  We didn't walk down to the beach due to lack of time. What spoils places like this are the tourists (and maybe locals) who leave their rubbish etc especially cigarette butts behind! Not to mention the stupidity of tourists perched precariously on the edge of the cliff to get that instagram pic!!!.If you are staying on Nusa Penida I think visiting early morning or late afternoon may give you a different experience.  
tessakathleen,11 contributions,May 2019,"The beach here is absolutely beautiful with white sand and clear water. The trail is very steep (nearly vertical in many places) and rough. It has steps cut into the dirt and railings tied together. I saw many people coming down with brown scraped butts and even saw one guy slip and take out the woman in front of him. This trail is not for inexperienced hikers, kids, or elderly. In many places you must rely on the railings for support and in some sections I saw the railings had fallen so take caution. Bring water as it’s a steep hot hike back up."
Kevin C,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2019,A must visit to this postcard location. Locals say they call it the T-Rex. A day trip to Nusa Penida must include a visit to Kelingking Beach. You can even walk all the way to the beach. Take a selfie stick for those over the edge photos.
amandamay245,1 contribution,Mar 2019,"What a beautiful and amazing place! Yes it is totally worth it to see. One thing you do want to do is get there early. We got there around 8:30am and there weren't too many people hiking down which was nice, we left close to 12 and there was busses of people and tours coming in. The hike down gets really steep pretty much straight up at the bottom. Make sure you are wearing good shoes. It is really not for the out of shape. The gnarliest hike I have ever done! And we are in shape. The beach is serene and amazing and worth it. Also coming back up isnt as bad but it gets really hot bring lots of water."
olivierpelloie,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"To be honest I was worried about the large crowd spoiling this beautiful place, but it turned out to be real amazing. If you want that “wow” feeling, I suggest you go:- on a sunny & clear blue sky day. That’s when the colours are really mesmerising. - outside of the high season mid-June / September.- all the way down to the beach. Clean sand, fun waves & shorebreak. It’s very well kept compared to other popular beaches."
departedroyalty,3 contributions,Dec 2018,Extremely beautiful beach. Took a ferry and the hike was worth it! So so beautiful. A sunny day is a plus point! 
Worldexplorew,3 contributions,May 2019,We just enjoyed the view from the top and decided NOT to do the trek down to Kelingking beach as it would mean that we would have to hike back up.  Instead we spent more time at Crystal beach.
Aditya Agrawal,"Raigarh, India",Apr 2019,"We stayed in Kuta and planned one day visit to Nusa Dua. We started with the speed boat which was approx 30-40 minutes ride.On reaching to Nusa Dua we went to the Kelingking Beach, we viewed this from top of the mountain. The view was stunning for us, and we were short of time so were unable to go down the hill to the beach. We regret not being able to go to the beach.It is a nice 3-4 hours activity and the color of water was amazing.Recommended location and day trip for a relaxed experience."
Life with the Singh Sisters,"New Delhi, India",Nov 2018,"The Nusa Penida Island is one of the best tours in Bali, Indonesia. Kelingking beach is on that Island and it is heavenly. It's like you found peace on earth."
daniramasyah,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2019,"Kelingking Beach is a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island. You can enjoy one of the most breath-taking views over the hills and small strip of white sand from atop a hill of the same name. The sight features a limestone headland covered in green, against the deep blue waters of the open Indian Ocean. This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‘T-Rex Bay’. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it’s during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you’ve reached the sand, you’ll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated. You can combine your visit to Kelingking Beach with a visit to an interesting temple nearby. Pura Paluang Temple is a couple of minutes’ ride east by motorbike, and features shrines in the shape of cars!"
Timmi002,"Washington DC, DC",Apr 2019,"This place is absolutely stunning and amazing.  This is THE REASON to come to Nusa Penida.  Totally worth the trouble of taking the boat over from Sanur.  The views from up top are breathtaking.  Expect massive crowds as this is one of Bali's biggest attractions.  If you want to escape the crowds, hike down to the beach.  It takes about an hour to get down and a bit more to come back up.  The path is super steep and not for the faint hearted as you are basically scaling a rock face to get down to the beach. But it's so worth it as the sand is pure and fine, the views are incredible and it's peaceful because only a fraction of the visitors come all the way down. I don't recommend flip flops but most people used just that.  Closed toe shoes that fasten to your feet like water shoes, Tevas, or sneakers would be better.  The bottom is rustic so bring everything you might need with you including water and towel.  Note: I think there was a guy selling water.  Be careful in the water as the waves are crazy.  One knocked me down and I had sand coming out of my ears for days.  But it was super fun.  If you have a sense of adventure, definitely do this!!!"
LionelTT,"Miri, Malaysia",May 2019,"Spotted a manta from the top. Amazing views wherever you step. Path down to the beach is pretty treacherous. I am amazed so many people just start walking and continue down- (herd mentality?? us included!). The tragedy of someone slipping and bringing many others down is too scary to imagine. After our visit, read that a Russian woman fell to her death here in Feb 2018.Saw dads carrying toddlers on their backs, and one did not even have a child carrier! The authorities should really construct a safer route to this magnificent beach.The bay is amazing once you get down. Well worth the climb down and up if you accept the risks. And no, there is no easier way, Ken! :)"
Dani W,2 contributions,May 2019,"The view from the top is spectacular, if you can see past the hordes of Instagrammers who rode up in their air conditioned vans. To get away from the crowd, I decided to do the trek/climb down to the beach, despite a previous guide telling me it was ""very dangerous."" Guys, it's not that bad. Given, I'm a rock climber who's in pretty good shape, but the steps are worn into the rock and the hand railing is solid up until the last maybe 100m, when you should test it before pulling hard. I wouldn't do it in flip flops, but I found my running sandals worked fine -- sneakers would've prevented me from feeling the rock. But if you're scared of heights, have knee problems, or aren't physically fit, probably skip the climb down. At the bottom of the climb is the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. Perfect white sand flecked with pieces of coral, a massive cavern on one side of the beach, and the T-Rex cliff on the other. The waves are big, strong, shore breakers and there is a fairly hefty rip current. If you are not an experienced ocean swimmer I'd suggest staying out of the water; I saw multiple people get thrown onto the coral-flecked shore by a wave, and it didn't look pleasant. If, on other hand, you know what you're doing in the water, get in! The slight danger makes it that much more exciting."
Amit Rane,"Navi Mumbai, India",May 2019,Must visit place in Nusa penidaLess rush before 9 am Lot of tourist between 9 am to 2 pm Good location for sunset too
daisy,"Woking, UK",May 2019,"The view was insane is 100% worth a visit! We did climb it down to the beach which was still stunning but was the hardest climb I’ve ever done in my life, I wouldn’t say it’s worth it to climb all the way to the bottom as the view is stunning without the climb and without the pain you’ll be in the next day. "
Storm,19 contributions,May 2019,"Well it's a big climb down. The stairs are very steep, so if you're small u will have trouble with them. If u have injuries or just bad condition I wouldn't recommend to climb down. The beach down is one of the best I ever seen. The water and waves a quite rough so it's not suited for bad swimmers. For me the climb up and down was totally worth it! Extra tip: don't come on flip-flops and bring a couple of bottles water with you. Down on the beach they sell, only for way to much money."
William L,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2019,Last min decision to do a day trip to Nusa Penida and this was one of the unforgettable experience. We took a tour that visit 4 places in Nusa Penida which include the boat trip to the island and car transfer to each site. The downside is that you cant stay too  long at each place around 30mins to 45mins most. If you really want to enjoy Kelingking beach and climb down to the beach it is recommended to get get your own transfer once arrive in the island. The tour I bought was west trip package.from 630am and get back at hotel at 6pm.The road is really bad and its a 40mins super bumpy ride to Kelingking Beach. I would only do it once more time as I didnt get a chance to climb down to the beach. The view was amazing and it is just as what is shown on instagram!! take as many pics as you want and just be safe! It is best to come here early (10am or earlier) to aovid the crowd.
louiseluckie,64 contributions,May 2019,"Honnestly it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done in my life.Be prepared with water and snacks as the water is 50,000 at the bottom.Takes about 30 mins to get down and 40 to get back up- depending on the amount of people you pass on the way. The view at the top is fantastic, a huge instagram hotspot (@louiseluckie), however, the climb down is one I will never do again.Take trainers. You practically climb up and down a vertical cliff, with spaces for your hands and feet. The current at the bottom is also very strong, huge waves drag you out and throw you back onto the shore. Good view from the top, but I wouldn’t climb back down again."
ECTMRO,"Timisoara, Romania",May 2019,"I'm not young but the effort was Ok.Amazing beach, one time in life to be there. If you are in good condition and your mind is strong you can to go there. Yes it is long path (50min down and 75 min up), yes it is dangerous, yes the effort is huge but on the beach is woow.Recommending 100%!"
mattyskarz,65 contributions,Apr 2019,"This place is literally CRAWLING with people that it is not enjoyable. The hike is steep and people are not prepared in dresses and flip flops for their insta photo shoot that it is  a traffic jam to hike down. It is impossible to even see the beach without a million people in view. The drive to kelingking is arduous, bumpy, and traffic ridden. We would not recommend it to people going to Bali and would not go back."
Theo,"London, UK",Apr 2019,"This is the best of Nusa Penida, you cannot miss this place if you go to Bali and Nusa Penida, no excuse guys! A must, a top photo shoot for Instagram too! It can be overcrowded yes, but my recommendation is to go early in the morning so you will have time to take good picture with a good lights and go all the way down. The water down there is just AMAZING. Best, Theo"
Elizabeth M,1 contribution,May 2019,"If you are in a really good shape, bring water and hiking shoes! Not flip flops!!! It’s really hard, it’s not a easy hike!! It’s not a clear steps, is just rocks... you handles but that pretty much! If you like adventure, push your body and do a lot of exercise this is the place for you!! It’s worth the hike if you can enjoy... if you are from the Caribbean like me, I don’t believe is worth the effort for something I can have in 15 min for home no effort!! I believe they need to make the notifications about how hard it is!! I don’t mean to scared anyone, I just think is better if you know!! It’s like a 1 hour going down!!"
VanessaMunYee,"Houston, Texas",May 2019,Stunning view from above. However it would be too long to get down to the beach and up again to get to the carpark. We are content just to be on top with the amazing view. Is a must see if you somewhere in Bali.
Balinese_wanderer,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2019,"Super proud being a balinese due to many travellers voted kelingking beach as number one exotic beach in the world, kelingking means pinkie finger (the shape of small island looks like pinkie finger). It is my 5th visit to kelingking beach and this place never failed to amaze me!"
emilykimble03,"Clarksburg, Maryland",Apr 2019,"This Beach is absolutely Beautiful. Most tourists that go here just stay at the top to get a photo. I highly encourage and challenge you to climb down the Mountain and see the Beach from the bottom. It's much more spectacular than you can imagine. Clear sky blue water with white sand and big waves. There are few people so it's relaxing. The journey to get to this beach is worth it. Put in the work and take the climb, I promise you won't be dissapointed. Wear good shoes because the climb is steep and rocky. There is no bathroom so bring wipes/toilet paper and a change of clothes. Drink plenty of water and be sure to bring money with you. There is a stand at the bottom with drinks. Wear Sunscreen!"
Anton K,"Berlin, Germany",Apr 2019,"This beach is one of the best beaches I’ve seen. But it’s hard to get down and getting back up is even harder. It’s mainly climbing so wear proper shoes! At the top it’s very crowded, but as soon you managed to get down you basically got the beach for your own. "
Wilmer L,"Sukawati, Indonesia",May 2019,I vist this place in the island 🏝But is to much peopleOver 1000 people per dayYou can't walk or enjoin the viewThe roads are very dangerousThe worst roads I ever see if it possible to call roadsVery difficult access 
Arek Areckhi,"Szczecin, Poland",May 2019,Wonderful views and long way down to the beach (about hundred meters). Best view on a right side. Just check photos.Ps. the road leading to this place is in very poor condition.  if you do not feel good on a scooter - hire a driver better.Entrance fee: 5k IRD
nellika63,ornskoldsvik,Apr 2019,"Went on a tour with driver around the island and I will never do it again. The roads are very narrow, curvy and bumby. Traffic jam everywhere as traffic can't meet in the roads. We went  around to see the islands best viewpoints, but it was crowded with tourists everywhere.  You have to stand in line to take a photo and for the viewed picture of Kelingking beach you have to climb a three to take a photo. It's a pretty island but if I go again I will get around the island with boat and I think Kelingking beach is great to visit from the sea as well."
Maria Cecilia G,3 contributions,Apr 2019,"This place is amazing. Not only for the views of the beach from the top, the shape of the rocks and the color of the water. You must go down to the beach! It's not an easy road (steep and rocky), but it's really worth it!It's a beach with transparent water waves and there are not many people there. Most of them just go to take the picture from the top (even they do a queue to take the picture! Crazy, but instagram times!). You will not regret of going here, it's a postcard in my mind! :)"
Abbiehorry,"Nottingham, UK",May 2019,Came here and was not disappointed! If you’re planning on walking down then wear suitable footwear and not sandals. Seen so many people wearing sandals/flip flops which is really dangerous!! Very hard walk but worth it! The road to this place is absolutely awful though. 
Ran Bon,"Pasay, Philippines",Apr 2019,"This place is magical. It has a jaw-dropping, breathtaking, unique view that seems surreal. You won’t be able to see a place like this in the world."
Arne Z,"Steyr, Austria",Apr 2019,"We went to Kelingking early in the morning to avoid the day tourists which was a good decision. The view is breathtaking, the scenery outstanding. We went down to the beach what was expected to be an easy hike but it was really difficult and dangerous. We are from Austria and used to climbing steep mountains but the way down to the beach is absolutely not for the faint-hearted. You need a very good condition, shouldn’t be afraid of heights and please don’t wear Flipflops but proper shoes (I didn’t). The „safety“, if you call it like this, is definitely not comparable to European standards.Once you reach the beach it’s worth the strains! But keep in mind that swimming is not possible due to huge waves and unpredictable and strong currents. So...cool down in the ocean a bit before starting the uphill which should be preferably before the masses of tourists arrive, otherwise you need hours to go back up."
Maarten P,5 contributions,Apr 2019,One of the best views of the island but the hike down is long and pretty rough almost descending vertically at times. The view can however also be enjoyed from above.
Adelene Tschuma,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Magnificent view overlooking the beach and ‘T-Rex’/‘finger’ shaped cliffs. Lots of people trying to take photos and I can only see this place getting more popular as time goes by.Roads aren’t the best getting to the view point by car or bike & getting down to the beach takes some time as the stairwell is fairly broken/old. Will definently recommend this place to friends and family, I can’t stop looking back at my photos, the beach is just so beautiful!! "
Maj S,"Baguio, Philippines",Jun 2018,"I highly recommend that you visit this place early in the morning, maybe between 6 am to 7 am to avoid group of tourists flocking on the very tiny stairs way down and be able to have tons of pictures without pressure. The view is very jaw dropping and really amazing, I could just stare at it whole day! The road going here is better compared top the roads going to other places. There are also some small eatery near the area where you can have your breakfast. I regret not going down to the beach so I recommend you must try it. There is no entrance fee which makes it good. Always remember, Be early! :)"
heggieNK,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2019,"View was just like in the pictures.  There was a small deck to take pictures from a higher viewpoint, pay 5000rupiah.  It was near a small eatery.  Go there early and beat the crowd from the daytrip bali tour.  "
Merce a,"Pecatu, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Nice place and a must if you come to Nusa Penida but too manta tourist and the way down to the beach isnt in good conditions. Good views and good places around to drink or eat some local food
Louise M,"Stockholm, Sweden",Apr 2019,Absolutely beautiful. A must do! A lot of people and a big climb down to the beach but worth every step.
Afzal H,18 contributions,Apr 2019,Better to get a view from the vantage points above the T-Rex rock. The hike is not for everyone. gorgeous place
Roversforever,"Bristol, UK",Apr 2019,You just have to see this. It’s beautiful. Climb down to the beach if you’re super adventurous. Just remember you will have to climb back up afterwards. You’ll need to be fit.
Pep Pla,"Ambon, Indonesia",Apr 2019,Far away. Bad track. Many spots to take a photo.Not suitable for people with vertigo. White sand and blue water. 
Lindzia A,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2019,Had to go go trough long journey and bumpy road. Be prepared! Not recommended to go by bike unless you are very very fit/ well experienced bikers and have loads of time to spend.
JustAretha,"Los Angeles, CA",Apr 2019,"Listen! I’ve read many stories about people falling to their death by getting too close to the edge. With that in mind, I pretty much stayed away from the edge. It is very tempting to want to get that ”perfect” picture so I see why so many risks to do so. However, getting too close to the edge is not necessary. Anywhere on the walkway at Kelingking is a great spot to take a picture without any unforeseen circumstances. The place is beautiful. Absolutely beautiful. A trip there is absolutely necessary if you're in Bali. I did not walk down to the each, because, frankly, it looked too scary for me. Plus, a few people who walked back up said it is a little frightening on certain spots going down & coming up. But the view above was all the evidence I needed to see. Grateful I had the opportunity to be a part of this journey and witness what nature spent millions of years to create. Enjoy! Be safe! Take lots of pictures... "
Rithy ☺️,11 contributions,Apr 2019,"Amazing !! If you go by yourself, please check the ferry schedule and location of the ferry pier. To us, we prefer to book a tour starting from our hotel. "
Tomáš Krejčí,36 contributions,Mar 2019,"If you have a little physical strength, go down to the beach. The way down (and up) is 20-30 minutes, depending on the tourists on the way. I have never seen such beach sand. The place is not for swimming"
Alvilde P,World,Apr 2019,Terrible with all the Trash at the beach. It is killing me. It is also killing the nature and the animals. 
cityofangels13,"Brisbane, Australia",Mar 2019,"The roads to this place are pretty crazy. The surface is terrible. However it is all worth it when you set eyes on this place. It is picture perfect if you are lucky enough to get it in good weather, The trek down is a little physical but well and truly worth it. The water is so clear and blue. Definitely one of my favorite places that I have been. I haven't seen anything like it. If I could pick one thing to go back to Bali and do or see this would be it hands down. Sure the roads are terrible and the trek down is sketchy but thats Bali. Well and truly worth it."
Natasha Gibson,"Ipswich, Australia",Mar 2019,"We visited Kelingking Beach recently when we did a tour of Nusa Pendia Island. Just breathtaking. If your feeling energetic you can take all the stairs right down to the beach. We didn't have the chance the day we visited, I loved to go back and do it though. We also saw some monkeys hanging around too on the day we visited."
Jahidul I,44 contributions,Mar 2019,I never seen that type of beautiful scenery/ view in my life. Nothing to say........ just Excellent. Don't miss to see  Kelingking Beach
Khir M,3 contributions,Apr 2019,"Been to Kelingking Beach recently. Dear readers, i would like to inform you if going down the hill takes 100% of your energy, going up might takes 300%. Its is not for everybody,but once you reach down the beach, the scenery is breath taking. Please make sure you have plenty of water (going up & down) and be careful with the tides / waves. it can be very strong and they almost drag me away into the sea."
asien_as,"Labuan Bajo, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"It was beautiful place, wish to spend more time and walk down to the beach. But we had limited time that day. Next time i will stay overnight to stay longer and see more of this place... its a considerably small island with several beautiful spot to relax. Riding a motorbike in a rain also quite a challenge here... because some of the road is still not perfectly smooth... so, we need to be careful. The view of this place is just amazing, thats why the tourists is quite crowded here... all want to have picture with the T-Rex shaped stone-like island close to the beach. we manage to have our pic and enjoy a fresh coconut to ease our thirst after about 1 hour ride from the harbour. "
Michael Pulido,5 contributions,Mar 2019,Lovely place to be in Nusa Penida. For more worth experience go face to face with Kelingking beach. =)
Girls On Global Adventures,"Porto Alegre, RS",Apr 2019,The view from the top was really amazing. Gazing upon the beauty of it from the top was pure bliss and with matching sunset it was a perfect way to conclude my Nusa Penida Trip
travelconfidentials,The Netherlands,Apr 2019,of Nusa Penida. First you don't have to stand in line (up stairs). People are waiting in front of the tree to make pictures. The is why the line is there.The climb down is a bit sketchy. Don't wear flip flops/thongs or jandals. I have seen people slip/slide/fall and break there foot wear.  They don't have normal stairs. It is just rocks/sand and or mud and it is very steep. It is even steeper when you want to go to the beach. The beach is beautiful. The waves are very strong. Be careful. At the beach you can buy drinks and snack butunfortunately it comes with the plastic mess that we tourists and the locals provide. Bring your stuff back don't trow it along the way (yes you can see bottles/cans etc) lying around. 
Tom,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Don’t get me wrong, it’s a gorgeous view (after you wait your turn amongst the hundreds of others there just to get a pic with this iconic beach. It takes forever to drive there on some of the worst roads I’ve encountered outside of Africa. In all honesty I think it is better to visit the sites of the island by boat than to set foot on land. The infrastructure is very poor. Pretty coastline but that’s about it. "
Greg F,"San Diego, CA",Feb 2019,This was a wow!  Gotta see this in person.  Road to the cliffs was really rough so be prepared for a jarring ride.  Then when you get there it's about 500 stairs straight down to the beach.  Not for the faint of heart or anybodybody afraid of heights.  
karlmonty,100 contributions,Mar 2019,What a view def worth checking out Nusa Penida if you staying in Bali some breath taken views 👌 !!!!
frida s,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"It's really worth to come to this place, through those bumpy roads and hot sunny day... but in the end, you will be surprised and amazed by the awesome view."
BeenThereDoneThatGB,"Edgware, UK",Mar 2019,"Amazing beautiful gorgeous out of this world beach.u can’t swim in it. Unless ur a very good swimmer waves and currents are way to strongIf ur not fit don’t even attempt to go there, it’s very hard to get down there but totally worth the walk.Make sure you wear proper shoes (you will thank me for that later)And I cannot stress this enough water water water."
mariosalltimefavs,"Berlin, Germany",Sep 2018,"Kelingking is defininately a must-see and the also the beach down the steep path...BUT it's just gotten simply too popular in the last years. A good indicator is that even Chinese people are hiiting the spot now, although the bamboo steps down are quite challenging."
Anjan G,"Hyderabad, India",Mar 2019,"As you all know this is the famous, most Instagram-ed icon of Bali and Indonesia... the beach that looks like a dinosaur head. Though we didn't get the chance to trek down to the beach itself the view from above was just mind-blowing. One of the most beautiful places in Bali, this beach is still to be developed as most roads are bad and the trail down is dangerous, but still its beauty is unmatched. A must visit stop in Bali!"
cesaralonsogs,"Austin, TX",Mar 2019,"We stopped at Kelingking Beach as the second place in our tour of Nusa Penida. We were not able to walk down to the beach due to our busy schedule, but the views from the top are stunning. A must-see if you are in Nusa Penida. "
Crystal C,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2018,"If i had enough time i would have chosen to stay in Nusa Penida for a night to truly appreciate the beauty of what this island can offer.  Kelingking Beach is stunning but crowded at noon/ in the afternoon.  We have to line up in certain spots to take a good photo.  Due to time constraint of the day tour, we were also not able to hike further down to the beach which was a big regret."
Verly T,14 contributions,Mar 2019,This place is very beautiful and is comparable to blue mountain in Australia. The slope is very steep but it has magnificent view. Did not manage to go down the slope as it is not suitable for young children. 
Iris L,"Pennington, NJ",Jun 2018,"Kelingking Beach is definitely one of the most beautiful beaches I have ever visited. With coral reefs, crystal clear water, and white sand, this is an amazing trip that you should be sure to visit. "
Sienna,"Little India, Singapore",Mar 2019,"I didn’t climb down because my friends and I didn’t have the time unfortunately. But the view was beautiful! There are a lot of tourists so keep that in mind but it’s stunning and if you walk around a bit you can get some great pics. If you’re hiking down, definitely wear sneakers! "
melissaj962,"London, UK",Mar 2019,"First of all, don’t do the day trip. You must stay on this beautiful untouched island for a few days to really appreciate Nusa Penida. We came to Kelingking twice - once around 8am to take photos from the top and fly the drone. A good time to get here before the cars full of tourists turn up (usually between 830-9) From this we then planned to walk all the way down to the beach a few mornings later and we started our walk at 7am. I’d advise getting there as early as this or even earlier to firstly hike in the cooler weather before it gets too hot and secondly so you can have the whole beach to yourself! Truly amazing.The hike itself is tough. We are both athleticly for and found it a challenge. It’s mostly rock climbing and if the weather has been raining the night before it’s very slippery. Make sure you wear trainers and sensible clothes. The halfway point hike isn’t too bad but to carry on after this and go to the beach is where it gets hard. There are ropes to help guide you down but once you’re down it’s so beautiful. Litter-free, supersoft sand and clear water. Not safe enough to swim in but still stunning. On the way back up make sure you have enough water and strength as for the most part you have to pull yourself up physically - there are no steps. Good luck!"
prem singh,"Faridabad, India",Mar 2019,amazing amazing & amazing .....wish i could go down the beach !!!. its a bit risky to go full down till bottom from Top.....if you got an opportunity book a ferry tour to its bottom .
mansiD88,"Pune, India",Mar 2019,One has to trek down to the beach below to see the true beauty of the place. The trek should be made preferably in shoes or sandals with back strap and would be better if the start is made early like 8.30 am so that it isn't too hot. The trek route has been fitted with rails to hold onto so it makes the walk easy as well and not so scary! Ofcourse you still sweat it out in the entire journey but the coconut water at the end of it is so refreshing :)
Joey Catania,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2019,"Beautiful Beach on the island of Nusa Penida. Unfortunately with my other review of Nusa Penida - this would be the only place worth visiting.Lovely and clean.However be warned it is not for the unfit or elderly. Please do not attempt the climb down to the beach is about a kilometer long and both the accent and decent are extremely treacherous,  with vertical climbs in some parts. If you injure yourself you will not be able to climb out and there are no emergency services to help you.  "
Emvestment,"Bangkok, Thailand",Mar 2019,"You need 5-10 mins walk from car park to have a good view. This place still completely perfect. You can take picture from the Top to get the best view. However there are a lot of tourists.RECOMMEND : 1.To bring umbrella with you and ware the comfortable suit because it is very hot.2. To have local guide, it is easy for you to reach many places such as Kelingling beach, Broken Beach, Crystal Bay and Angel Billabong because mobile signal is not quite good for using GPS"
Marisa W,"Newman, Australia",Mar 2019,Views where amazing but no way i was walking down those steps to stand on that beautiful beach. Road bad in patches getting to the viewpoint 
WarrenMoonjr,"Minneapolis, MN",Feb 2019,"The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. Kelingking beach is located on Nusa Penida, with is a separate island located about 30 minutes by boat from Sanur, Bali. Nusa Penida is still undeveloped, and I would recommend spending a few nights here to really enjoy the island. Another option would be staying on Nusa Lembongan which is only a 5 minute boat ride away from Penida, it has more accommodation options available (in total their are 3 Nusa Islands all located next to each other). Note: It's takes about 30 minutes to get down to the actual beach at Kelingking, but around 1-1.5 hrs to climb back up. The stairs are steep and rocky, not the easiest climb. Their are hand rails most of the way, would not recommend the climb for anyone with mobility or endurance issues. Many people simply come and take pictures from the top without ever climbing down to the water. And that works fine for all fitness/mobility levels. It's a very popular spot, get there early if you can to avoid the crowds. Nusa Penida is amazing, this isn't a spot to rush through in one day. They have tons of great beaches (like crystal bay), great snorkeling, and landmarks like angels billabong, broken beach, etc. The roads to get around the island are in pretty bad shape. Tons of potholes and rubble. It takes a long time to travel around the island because of the bad conditions. If you are renting a scooter be very careful on the roads. You can also rent a driver to get around, it's expensive, but worth it for convenience."
Brenda W,7 contributions,Nov 2018,"Steep! bring water and wear shoes!! Amazing views and soft sand. Watch the tide pull, though. Potentially very dangerous."
Globspotters,"Gdansk, Poland",Mar 2019,A lot of tourists! very nice place although the queue to the picture spoils a little all. around a lot of interesting places where you can eat well
Darma S,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"I visited Kelingking Beach with our Guest few weeks ago, it is really amazing place, for selfie , pre weeding photo, and to enjoy the best view of beautiful scenery. Best time to visit is day time so We can see the blue clear  water . When you visit Bali , please do not miss this place. "
nicholasbhc,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2019,"The visit was crowded with the arrived fast tourist, so to get a selfie was at your peril..but the coast is outstanding..the roads were rough...You need to be fit and with appropriate climbing footware, its quite dangerous if your not use to climbing but there is a firm rail..I wonder whether the locals are happy with the  amount of traffic and convoys of white transporter taking up the road..with the cost is unrealistic,for a single traveller i paid 1,500 000 or 1,100000 for a couple this included broken rock, angel b and crystal and all trsnsfer..only 50,000 really!! Not a water include..i feel the boat companies are taking a huge cut and there appears to be not money going into the island resources like inproving the roads..i see locals looking annoyed.I would just get a fast boat there and just spend all day at crystal beach..until the last fast boat back..4:30 and 5:30 depends on boat company.I wouldnt be racing back there in any hurry.."
LSJ,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2019,"If you are a lover of a cliff with beach & sea, this is a breadth taking view that you cannot find anywhere else.A good place to visit but this place is getting crowded with tourist each day. Tour and guides are also getting more expensive."
FlanMurray,"Charlottetown, Canada",Feb 2019,"Views here are very beautiful and breathtaking! Lots of shops to buy drinks and food at the top. It’s a very steep climb down, only made it halfway down. Watch out for Instagram models trying to get the “perfect shot”. Queues of people lining up to get the “shot” get in the way of the actual pathway and can be dangerous"
bromo ijen tour service,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"good vibes when you love a cliff with beach & sea ,and another island will reach in 45 minute from sanur bali by fastboat ,nusa penida has a lot of beach and not too many people around there , if you more than 3 person better you use a car hire you can found it around the port of penida island - bromo ijen tour driver - +6281 - 39000 - 7303"
Lori K,Boulder CO,Feb 2019,"Stunning location.  It is a challenge to get there.  I would recommend a driver and just be prepared for a bumpy ride.  This view is not to be missed!  The route down to the beach is much harder than it looks, mostly because it was SO HOT and HUMID.  I did not make it all the way down to the beach, but was very content to take in the view from the top. "
Barry Sloan,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2019,An amazing place to visit. Be aware though that the road there is very very rough. Recommend you go there with a local driver
Suha,Kaadedhdhoo,Nov 2018,A must see beach. The road to reach this beautiful destination was tough but totally worth it. I would definitely go there again.
Mike G,26 contributions,Jan 2019,"Lots of reports of this place getting too popular w day trippers. Is true, so best to stay on Penida for a few days, get a motorbike and explore. I got to Kelingking at 8:30 am and had it ALL TO MYSELF! Climbed down to the beach (very challenging coming back up but well worth it!) and had that to myself too. A few brave souls made it down a while later. Easily THE most beautiful site I’ve ever seen and THE most beautiful beach. "
karthikeyan_nadar,"Chennai (Madras), India",Feb 2019,"In nusa penida it’s one of the best . It was very beautiful to have a good view of the beach from the top . I wanted to walk down to the beach , but I had no time . Try to go early in the morning to the beach as it’s very hot and humid . Take lot of photos . For kids it’s not safe . No proper fence. It’s must visit place . "
Stephie Cyr,"London, Canada",Feb 2019,Don't miss this hot spot. There are multiple places to take jaw dropping pictures. The hike down is quite steep so I skipped it but really a gorgeous must see site 
Flyer55_12,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,"Nusa Penida is a great place but those couple of places were all those Chinese tourists go to can get a bit crowded, where as the other spots you can sometimes have all to yourself. Try to go very early or very late in the day to miss the crowds."
danny1127,"Bristol, UK",Feb 2019,"Yes it is a gruelling walk down and back up. And you will definitely work up a sweat. But it is definitely worth it! Quiet beach at the foot of the cliff. Not overly touristy with some of the softest sand, clearest water and best waves going. Great fun in paradise. Word of advise, the climb is difficult and at times quite dangerous. Be careful and may Be consider taking a pair of good trainers for the walk down and up. Also take some water or snacks down with you. There is a little family vendor down on the beach but they will understandably charge you a fortune so go prepared. "
Zac,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2019,"The view of the beach, water and cliff is amazing. Definitely worth a trip. The scooter ride was fine but if you aren’t experienced or don’t want to get a sore bum, hire a car to take you over - it’s a 30-40min ride. We went on a really hot day and struggled to get out of the sun If you hike up to the right there’s a few nice spots for photos If you go snorkeling at manta ray bay get your guide to point this beach out "
Megan S,16 contributions,Feb 2019,Stunning!!! If you are looking for a perfect instagram photo then this is it!To get there you can go with a car or hire scooters. We hired scooters because we love going out on our own. If you hire a scooter try get one that has good shocks because the road is very very bad in some parts. Once you are there and you would like to tan on a quiet beach then there is a path that takes you down to a quiet beach but its a difficult path to get down but so worth it.
Karen B,"Gold Coast, Australia",Feb 2019,"The view from the cliff here is spectacular and you will get some amazing photos.  But...... it is very crowded and there are many people lining up to get the standard insta photo.  And they don't care how long they hold the queue up.  Apart from that, nice spot.  Pity it takes forever to get there on the terrible roads.  Is quite steep too so not suitable for anyone will mobility issues."
GodBlessMali,"Shanghai Region, China",Feb 2019,"Even though I went to Bali for scuba diving, I had to spend one day visiting the west part of Nusa Penida which I believe is more famous and appealing than the east part.My first stop was the Kelingking beach which I absolutely loved. Many people complained about the crowd, but if you visit it before 11AM like I did, you won't see a lot of people until you go back to the top.The view from the top is breathtaking, and you can fully admire the T-Rex shape that everyone talks about. However, there is more to it. If you take your courage in both hands, and make it all the way down to the beach, you will not regret it. Though be warned than it's rather tricky to reach to the beach, and I strongly recommend you to wear a good pair of shoes over sandals, but you will want to wear the latter once you reach the beach. A woman twisted her ankle on the way down, and I have absolutely no idea how she made it back to the top so please be careful if you wish to go to the beach.Once you are at the beach, simply enjoy. The waves crushing on the beach make it a very relaxing place, and the view is also quite amazing. That said, if you wish to swim, you might be disappointed as the currents are quite strong, and only experienced swimmers should enjoy.Again, if you want to fully enjoy this place, go early in the day. There were six or seven people on the beach when I went in the morning, but close to a hundred when I went back up early in the afternoon.Enjoy :)"
Lizzie M,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,"If you are visiting Nusa Penida here is a must. Such stunning views and beautiful beach. However please note it gets very busy here as it is a very ""instagramable"" location. It is best to get here early to beat the crowds. Also make sure you have water with you as it gets very hot here and there is alot of stairs. "
rodden23,"Qingdao, China",Feb 2019,One of the most beautiful beaches one earth and one of the most Instagram-worthy photo ops in Asia! A must visit when in Bali!
honzamartinec,133 contributions,Feb 2019,"This place is most famous in this island and you should visit as well. There is lots of tourists up there to take a shot, but get down to the beach and it will be much better. It's not hike for everybody and sometimes it's bit scary, but wooden railing is ready to help. It's worth it "
An T,"Kharkiv, Ukraine",Feb 2019,"Will never forget the beauty of this place! You just want to stay there and stare at the place.It’s possible to go down to the beach,but the stairs are very steep,we went down half way and couldn’t make it to the end:very hot! We went up and I thought my heart would stop beating. I don’t recommend to go down the steps unless you plan to swim and rest down there,though people say it’s even harder to go back after swimming.From the top it’s as beautiful as from the bottom "
Matt Bakes,"East Riding of Yorkshire, UK",Feb 2019,Well worth a visit! The views from the top are incredible. Didn’t take the steps down to the beach as it takes around 2 hours to go down and back up
Hus,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2019,"Kelingking beach is a must visit when you go to Nusa Penida.The actual beach is located at the end of the cliff and is a steep climb down.It is easy while going down but get exhausting while climbing back up beware.The entire experience will talk at least half a day so only recommended for those who stay in NP.Day trippers can enjoy view from top.The trek down is scary but the thrill and adrenaline and what you want for adventure.Be sure to have a coconut after the trek costs 20,000 and a huge one"
zagidullinakristina,"Kazan, Russia",Feb 2019,So dangerous and long stair. Impossible for old people and children. Be careful. But really cool beach and view.
Flory S,15 contributions,Jan 2019,"View from the top was stunning, but getting to Kelingking is really difficult! The roads are pretty bad, and whether you go by scotter or car prepare for a tiring journey.Yes, it was amazing to look at the view but I dont think I will do it again for the pain you have to endure with the horrible roads. We didnt go down to the beach as you can tell by the path, that its not an easy one to climb down and up - it's really steep and adventurous! We also heard stories of people who went down and were stuck as they couldnt come up. Only thing annoying was the number of instagram crazy people who would do anything for a perfect picture! We even thought some of them were going to fall down the cliff as they were staying really close to the edge. We went in the supposedly low season, and I thought this was crowded. If you are going during the peak season, then be prepared for a ton of tourists when you get to this place."
Kevin,"Ubud, Indonesia",Feb 2019,"Getting to Kelingking is kind of a challenge due to the bad roads. But totally worth it!When you arrive theres an amazing view from the top of the cliff.Theres also the option to go down the cliff to the beach. I would only advise to do that with enough to drink and a little food. It's quite an adventure and can be very challenging if you're not too fit. On the beach there is a man selling drinks, but prepare to pay the max price there, we paid 110k for a large bottle of water and 2 cokes (and were happy to)."
Ron,"Taguig City, Philippines",Dec 2018,"Visited here year end with my family and friends.Second day of our trip  is Nusa Penida Day. We wouod love to see both east and west but due to time restriction we only have the chance to visit the west. Kelingking Beach is the most popular among all west area tourist spots. I can simply say that this place is simply amazing. Picture perfect. Instagramable.Super worth the bumpy ride (about an hour or so travelling in a rough road, small road near the clift) needs to be a good driver to reach the place.Its Haven for me....i enjoyed the view.Really Perfect!! The deep TRex shaped rock formation  covered w green grass and trees, super white sand , and deep blue see, ohh God! Its really amazing,! I cant get over !!! Would love to go down to be near and even see the beach but since we have minor with us we opted not and just enjoy the moment and take photos , relax and wander! Good thing we didnt go down as after some.minutes rain poured. So it will.be more stiff and slippery.  Super worth the trip, the money,! One of a kind experience! One of the most and must see in Bali,! Never miss the chance! "
Frank C,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,I was impressed with this beach type of cliff beaches look clean and without sort of pollution a must for must for tourists to see 
Xanerin,"Alice Springs, Australia",Jan 2019,"This is a fabulous beach and you can get some great photo shots, but boy is it a hard trek to get to it, and of course even harder coming up.  If you are not fit and agile, I would suggest not attempting it.  Some monkeys live in this area which were really cute and it is really a beautiful place to see nature at its best.  Plenty of toilets available in the area 5000 rupiah. "
Dima,"Moscow, Russia",Jan 2019,"But so very hard. Me and my wife down 35 minutes. However this beach... I recommend. Take away comfortable shoes, because very slick "
Devang,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2019,"To reach Nusa paneida from Bali, was great experience by travellingin a cruise name: MOLA MOLA tour cruise. It took approx; 40 mins to reach Nusa paneida harbour.From Harbour to kelingking beach, it took approx. 1 hour to reach. The roads are too narow to reach. But, when we reached there, our all tiredness gone.The view was significantly scenic & i have never seen such clear crystal water. God has gifted them very beautiful beach. Really, can't miss this spot in Bali."
Biswadeep M,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Jan 2019,"If you are in Bali and not visiting Just Penida,  you will regret later.  This was the first place we went during our trip.  It took 40mins to reach the point.  Roads were little bumpy not recommended for pregnant women. What do I say about the view, it was breath taking. There are multiple photo spots which you should must take selfies. If you are adventurers and would like to take some risk,  can actually go down till the end to explore the beauty.  Please note: Roads towards the beach 🌊☀ is quite dangerous, take decision wisely.  "
Wayan Trips Bali,"Kuta, Indonesia",Jan 2019,Kelingking beach one of best beach at Nusa Penida islandWill you visit this place.? Get resonable price and experienced driver
KomangAkah,"Nusa Lembongan, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Kelingking Beach also known as Dino Beach. The road to this place is not really good but it is paid after you arrived here. It is really instagram-able place with a superb view. If you have enough power and love challenge, you can come down and enjoy the nice beach. But if you are not, relax and taking picture from the top of the cliff is also nice."
Olia F,"London, UK",Jan 2019,One of the best beaches...ever. The climb is insane and dangerous but if you are fit I highly recommend it. Allow for at least half a day for it to truly enjoy. The climb is a half hour if not longer. Blew my mind.
rohancarrall,7 contributions,Jan 2019,"The views from the top of this cliff are absolutely amazing, with the water a mix of crystal clear with deep blues and greens. The currents were a little strong when we took the mighty trek down to the beach itself, but both the trek and the currents are well worth the views. "
Sue V,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jan 2019,"Kelingking Beach was everything I thought it would be, the photos just don't do it justice.Be warned though the roads are atrocious in and out of the area and there is a constant stream of cars and scooters. The walk down to the beach isn't for feint hearted and you need to allow about 2 hours for the return trip including a swim. The surf was very strong the day we visited and it would be quite dangerous for poor swimmers."
Nicole D,"Ubud, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"Truly a remarkable experience!  If you travel to Bali visiting nusa penida Island is a MUST! We had our own travel guide who took us to the local beaches (broken beach, billabong, kelingking beach and crystal beach). Just know this is an entire day trip! We left our hotel in ubud at 7am and arrived back at 5pm. Wear comfortable shoes so you can hike up and down kelingking beach. Please please wear sunscreen as the sun gets extremely strong around 11pm. I have a slight sun burn because I didn’t put sunscreen on early enough. Other than that, enjoy the magnificent island! Take a load off and enjoy your surroundings ❤️. And please please do pick up after yourselves. We must preserve this place as long as we can."
Aron B,Norway,Aug 2018,"If you have the time, take a day trip to Nusa Penida. I would recommend using the tour operator ""Bali mission tour"".Kelingking is really stunning. If you have the time, take a walk down to the beach."
jabir1423,"Sibiu, Romania",Jan 2019,"Amazing wonder of nature. If you can and have the stamina for it ,you should definitely go down to the beach. Breath taking!"
Bali Nusa Penida Tours,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"It's really best place of worlds,we are neverever see the place like Klingking beach really nice view and romantic place Also nice pre-wedding "
Kenny100653,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,"brilliant views - good facilities with plenty of food outlets and places to sit. did not venture to the beach as it looked quite a hike, but well worth the effot I would suggest."
Travel dreams,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2019,"amazing. If you want to go down to the beach. You need 2-3 hours. And a really good shape. Its a long way, not a easy.  "
Cristina S,10 contributions,Jan 2019,"Kelingking beach is very pretty. The water is very blue and the waves are strong. The beach is large and it offers you a little stand with drinks and snacks (incredibly expensive!!)However, the climb to get up and down is difficult and dangerous. It takes about 30-45 min to get down and it can get very steep and hard on the knees. Going up can require a lot of water because it’s incredibly hot.Once you’re up, there are some restaurants offering all kind of things to eat. Honestly, I would suggest you to stay up and take pictures ans then go for a swim at another beach. Ps, the entrance is 5000rp/person"
David K,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2019,"Amazing beach, fun hike down and back up, quite strenuous, not suitable for the elderly or young children, make sure you go at low tide only"
Suzana Fernandes,2 contributions,Jan 2019,Perfect. Just the mkost beautiful beach ever seen! The hiking is hard but worth it. Almost desert beach. 
MsLigs,"Kriens, Switzerland",Jan 2019,"Truly a nature’s wonder. I was in awe of the beauty of this place, although going there is tough. The road is very rough and takes around an hours ride from the harbor but it was all worth it. The view is awesome and they have white sandy beach aside from the view of the dinosaur shaped head rock formation. I would surely come again to explore more that place and perhaps stay longer in this Island. It was the highlight of our New year Indonesia trip."
illion,11 contributions,Dec 2018,Getting a picture was a crazy scramble. Our guide told us going down to the beach would take 2 hours which we didn’t have time for. The view was fantastic but hardly enough time for a 1 day tour. Stay longer if you can
Lita,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"kerrrrrrrreeeeeeeennn it's like a big pool with the head of dinosaurs. nice view. kelingking beach is the prettiest ever beach i ever saw, you must go there and take a selfie but still be careful with the cliffs."
Faye Pelagio,"Quezon City, Philippines",Dec 2018,This beach is such a beauty! Too bad that we ran out of time to go down to the beach (30minutes walk if you really want to go down). The road going here is too narrow and bumpy. Our driver is the best in taking picture and he made sure that our safety is his first priority. 
cavamebri,"Albany, Australia",Jan 2019,"Incredible view from the top and amazing scenery. Unfortunately it was very, very busy when we were there. There is also a lot of rubbish littered around, which is so disappointing. Why do people have to drop their empty water bottles and empty packets everywhere? So easy to take it back with you and put in a bin!"
Gani Wibisono,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Amazing place....the view is spectacular !! if you want you can down to the beach, about 45 min to go down, and around 1 hour or more to go up back...the sand is so white so so beautiful "
Belinda M,80 contributions,Jan 2019,"Hot tip: Go in the early morning to avoid the bulk of people! We had finished the climb at around 12/12:30 and there were so many people up top taking photos and along the climbing route.This makes the climb longer as you have to wait for the people in front of you. The climb itself is quite difficult. It took us approximately 30mins to get back to the top and we are relatively fit people. At some parts you will be basically rock climbing vertically (your legs and muscles will be sore the next day). The lack of stairs makes it challenging but is also what makes it adventurous and fun. The beach is really nice. It does have large waves and currents, so listen to the lifeguard and be prepared to be dumped by the waves at some point. I would definitely recommend this climb and beach! "
Jade L,"Denarau Island, Fiji",Jan 2019,"There was a lot of people on top of the Kelingking Beach. There’s so good views. The stairs (can’t really call them stairs😂) was very hard and tough. I felt like I’m gonna pass out, my friend needed to carry some woman up because she was passed out in the midway. It took almost 2 hours to get down because it was raining and the steps were very slippery and I did it barefoot. The way up took about 1 hour. After hardwork there is beautiful beach but be careful because waves are big and currency is strong. I don’t recommend going down if you don’t have enough power and you should bring a lot of water and wear proper sneakers. Not gonna go down ever again.. "
Sharon P,3 contributions,Dec 2018,"Tough climb down, and a little dangerous. I felt like it was worth it.  But be careful playing in the water, the pull of the waves can be very dangerous.  Best beach I've been on.  ever.  "
bigblub,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,Not recommended for young children the track was very hard and slippery need moderate skill to take to the beach
Mark and Mikaela,"Vientiane, Laos",Dec 2018,"If you are confident with scooters you can go check it out yourself, if not book a tour! Roads can get pretty bad and narrow with other cars on the road. Once you are there check out all the lookouts around the cliff and go down to at least the neck of the dinosaur! Watch out for super steep and slippery steps! "

AlexCarcea,"London, UK",Dec 2018,"If you travelling to Bali and you’re not going to see this beach you will regret all your life . The landscape from top it is like heaven, amazing, for me one of the best beach in the world and I have seen a few around the world.Our planet is beautiful. Love Earth 😍"
Caroline C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"The landscape from above is magnificent. If you have time, you should go down to the beach but the road is very steep. Please use comfortable shoes or sandal. I can't believe such place exist. Very beautiful."
Marleen J,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Oct 2018,Come early! The crowd arrive at about 10:30ish and this makes it difficult to ascend the very steep steps to the beach. The climb is really strenuous. There is a small warung at the bottom.
Ali Asgar B,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",Nov 2018,This is the most beautiful beach to visit Bali with crystal clear waters. you can see lots of fishes specially Manta Ray in this beach
Mike B,"Southend-on-Sea, UK",Dec 2018,"I wasn’t really sure what I was expecting when I turned up at this place. The staircase down to the beach is... something else. I wouldn’t recommend without a good level of fitness, bravery and a strong pair of shoes. The beach at the bottom is WELL worth it! The waves were about 10 foot plus so we had fun playing in the waves for a few hours. There was a guy at the bottom selling snacks and water so don’t worry too much if you can’t take it.  It recommended for kids."
Sangeetha S,"Bangalore District, India",Dec 2018,This place has retained its pristine charm mostly due to the difficulty involved in actually navigating all the way down. The place is literally breathtaking. The blue of the ocean is mesmerising. This is a must see beach and something you would absolutely love at first sight. It’s a pleasure even to see this from atop the hill if one isn’t interested or has a shortage of time to go all the way down. 
SARIAH A,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,It looks like monster from top. Its nice and beautiful. Its worth to visit. Its 45mins journey from Bali by Ferry. Less tourists. A place that not fully develop. 
Peter V,"Toronto, Canada",Dec 2018,"One of our favourites on Nusa Penida. The view is unreal, however the steps to get down are quite dangerous. If you are not comfortable with hiking, definitely avoid. One mistake and you are done. Runners highly recommended!"
Antonis Mykonos,"Mykonos, Greece",Nov 2018,"Incredible view!!! Really dangerous paths, ridiculous the fact that these disgusting dirty toilets had a sign outside with the price for use. "
SingaporeYoungCouple,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"'Kelingking' in Indonesia language is 'the little (last) finger'. But in my view i see it more like a shape of T-rex dinasour 😁. And the island next to it (left side) look like a crocodile head. Be extra careful of steps and the bamboo barrier. The bamboo barriers are not strong. Steps to the beach below are very steep! If u're not fit, dont allow yourself to do it and just enjoy the view frm above. "
Frogimo,"London, UK",Nov 2018,"The way to the beach is quite dangerous as there is not real path way, just an oddly built way down a cliff... Not advised if you aren't in a good physical shape.... But totally worth the effort if you want to see an incredible untouched, naturally beautiful, beach. (The efforts makes you appreciate the beach even more!) Don't forget to take sports shoes for the climb!"
David,New Zealand,Oct 2018,The view and the beach are stunning and the walk down the stairs is an adventure. We went there on a weekend and there too many people to really enjoy the place though. Tricky to get that empty beach Instagram shot ;-) 
Shyama R,New Delhi,Dec 2018,"Well this is the most beautiful beach I have seen in my lifeAfter seeing the beach from the cliff we decided we had to go down.  The whole climb was not easy. There are no stairs. Just the rocks with some space. Wooden blocks or bamboos are placed on both sides for support. At certain point there is only place for 1 person to stand at a time. It will take 20-30min to go down. But it's worth it. Clean and blue beach. The waves are strong yet awesome. Caves on both sides. It just like in movies. Beware on climb up as it will drain you. Took us around 1 hour. And the sun was just bright and hurting us. Well no matter how dangerous it was, everything was worth it. If you just want to  stay at the cliff and click only photos. It's ok, but trust me the real beauty is not the cliff."
AnnalisaRobLeo,Sri Lanka,Dec 2018,"Its a bumpy journey to get to by car but worth a visit. I would suggest that you hire a driver for the day, we paid about £25... The views over Kelingking beach are spectacular.  The journey down is tough so only attempt if you are fit to climb down a pretty ropey track. Kelingking beach is very close to Broken beach and Angels Billabong so you can see 3 attractions all in the same area."
Kalie L,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2018,"Next time, I would go by boat. It is about an hour walk down, hate to think how long it would take me to get back up! Lol.Not for people with mobility issues. You need to be fit!"
May L,"San Francisco, CA",Nov 2018,"We had a full day originally coming from Peguyangan, Tembeling Beach, and then Kelingking. The journey was quite long, but getting there was sooooooo worth it. I didn’t trek down to the beach at Kelingking, so we enjoyed the sunset from above. It seriously is so worth the long journey. I totally recommend this. "
Mahesh Jaiswal,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2018,"Must visit place, it’s apart of Nusa penida tour, you can pre Book it there are many agencies or you can ask your hotel. "
Diksha S,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2018,"We had view from top of the mountain, to reach down to the beach it is trek of 1 1/2 hrs to 2 hrs, so we didn’t go down to the beach but still from upstairs the whole was mesmerisingMust visit if you’re planning for Nusa Penida "
Anabel M,43 contributions,Nov 2018,"Price is 5k per person and 1k for the scooter. You can rent a bike and go on your own. The roads are in bad conditions but it's not impossible, if you are on a tight budget and have some experience driving I would say this is the way to go. Be patience and go slowly. The views are amazing but we decided not to go down because it was raining pretty bad all day since 7am and I didn't have good footwear.. after reading some comments here I am glad we didn't do it. We had some food there, 30k for a nice chicken rice. If you are here on rainy season always have a good poncho with you and wear sandals."
NinaTraveler,"Zurich, Switzerland",Nov 2018,The beach is super beautiful but the access to go down the cliff could be really dangerous if you didn't have any hiking or climbing experience.
rgill_28,"Vancouver, Canada",Nov 2018,"Stunning view from up top of the dinosaur rock. Can get really pretty views at sunset. That hike down. Oh wow, that was very very hard. It’s extremely slippery going down. I have size 14 feet which made it very difficult for me to find footing to place my feet. I hike quite often back home in Western Canada, so I felt pretty confident doing it until I slipped and fell and cut up my elbows. Then entire way down, shaking legs and thoughts of “oh god I’m going to die here.” I advice anyone doing this hike: if you struggled in the first half of the hike which is until the dinosaur’s back and then u turn towards the beach and start going down to do other half. TURN back! So can get some very pretty pictures from there because the second half down is soooo much worse and extremely steep with very tight spacing which makes it very tricky when ur going down and ppl are coming up. Some ppl were doing the hike bare feet to get better grip which might be an idea worth trying?!?Once you get down to the beach, it is pure paradise. Can’t swim in it but the massive waves are beautiful to see and there is a tiny stand down there serving drinks which is cool. Can’t believe they go up/down that hike every day with merchandise. Hike back up was fine for me because I have strong upper body and it requires lots of pulling yourself up holding onto support branches that are places along hike. My wife who has weak upper body found it very challenging going back up and was sore for about 3 days where she couldn’t move her arms without pain. Hike down she flew down because she had to pee real bad."
Mika S,Salo,Nov 2018,Fantastic view. I got a lot of very nice pictures from there. Stairs were scary. Be carefully if you are going down to beach. 
Rony,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2018,"Worth the 30 mins of a hike down to the beach. Be careful when holding onto those ""fences"" as it's not stable and it's steep as f*#$ as well.  "
Marcio M,"Niteroi, RJ",Oct 2018,One of the most beautiful places around Bali. From the top you have a great view and a long track down to the beach. But it worthwhile.
foodcrawlph,"1,536 contributions",Nov 2018,Picturesque view from the top but the trail leading to the beach requires a long hike. Travellers who intend to walk down the beach area should be prepared with enough water and proper footwear. We skipped the steep walk and stayed in the cliff bThere are food stalls near the parking area for meals and refreshments for a fairly affordable price. 
Jon_Ju1234,"Reykjavik, Iceland",Jun 2018,"We went to Kelingking beach on a day where it was raining on off. It was not raining, but the ground was wet. We decided that climbing down to the beach down below was a good idea. However, the path is VERY steep and slippery.During our decent to the beach my girlfriend slipped, and her phone jumped up from her purse. I watch it skip down the steep path and past the ""safety"" bars. From there the phone slid about 1 meter and stopped on an edge.5 cm more and it would have dropped to the ocean c.a. 100m bellow. Somehow I managed to get on my stomach and squees through the safety gate(a week fence made from bamboo). I reached the phone, realising shortly after that it was probably not worth the risk I took.Basically, if you decide to go to the beach at the bottom, make sure you are wearing good shoes and be sure to be extremely careful if you decide to go when the path is wet.However, this place is amazing, you don't need to go to the beach bellow to enjoy it."
Septia C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"One of the most beautiful places I have ever visited! I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw it! Unbelievable! i went down the cliff to the beach and it was more than worth it. only a few people there, and at the top, there were actually many people."
Annie Pham,"Calgary, Canada",Nov 2018,"Come here early, or after 3pm as this place gets extremely crowded! This place is so beautiful and definitely worth a visit! "
Diaz P,96 contributions,Nov 2018,"I like natural view and not common. So I choose Nusa Penida. Comparing my visit last year, more tourists visit this beach. Unfortunately Local government does not yet build road facility to this beach. Other facilities that must be equipped are trash bin, cellular access and winker. I also suggest to local audthority to add two trips to Bali from Nusa Penida so we have more time to enjoy Nusa Penida and able to come back to Bali at 17 PMI called my holiday to some spots in Nusa Penida as extreme journey, because we need more effort and power to arrive there using motor cycle (some roads are still broken and only a few winker) and off course walk down to the spot or walk down to the steps. Need to dare to walk down and pass ravine. I dont have daring to pass ravine. So I enjoy the rock cliff and sea view. How about youI agree with other writers that the traveller must prepare the best route to maximize your visit in 1 or 2 days, powerbank, guide (if needed), equipment (sun glasses etc)"
emtod,"Gainesville, FL",Oct 2018,"Obviously I saw a photo of Kelingking Beach on Instagram about 2 years ago, and ever since then I knew I had to go see it. Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able. I could have done it in flip flops, but I didn't want to ditch my husband lol.Beyond the actual views, there are a bunch of warungs where you can get food and drink, fresh coconut, etc. We did have to pay a small fee (15,000? 11,000 IDR?) to park our motorbike there as well, which was fine. The road to the actual beach is not paved and needs some serious work -- the east side of the island, in comparison, is *much* nicer in that regard. But I'm sure in a year or two, it'll all be paved."
Pratyush Srivastava,"Navi Mumbai, India",Oct 2018,"This place is surreal and truly heaven. The T Rex shaped cliff and clear blue water with hundred shades of blue.. Perfect for picture and enjoy the nature and sea around.. To reach the beach one needs to climb down the cliff, a lil hard, but doable. Takes more than an hour or two.. If you have time, don't miss going down beach.. You won't regret this.. But don't swim too far..Its a perfect place to be.. and most beautiful in Nusa Penida.. Bali too..."
HariKRajeev,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2018,This is one of the places to visit before you die . The beach has a viewing area from the top . We can take pictures from there . If it is a crowded day then you will have to stand in a long queue . There is a narrow walk way to the beach . It is very steep . A lot of tourists take that . But it is broken in the beginning. 
Janwood47,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Nov 2018,"We had a driver all day who took us here.  The view was spectacular however the road needs improving, given the large of amount of daily traffic to this special tourist attraction."
librandips,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,The beach is lovely and untouched. Perfect to take nice photos. Not sure if u can all the way to the bottom. 
swissmanagement1,"London, UK",Nov 2018,"Not an easy hike but certainly worth the views all the way down, most beautiful scenery in Nusa Penida Island"
Tacion83,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Nov 2018,Good place to visit in Nusa Penida. You can take car/rent bike to go there. Must visit place. We enjoyed a lot. 
Annalina,"Varberg, Sweden",Nov 2018,"The view is amazing but do not climb down the “stairs”, the ground is moving beneath your feet and the steps are made from bambu and the railings are not steady! It’s a 45 min walk/climb down to the beach. Some steps are about a meter apart. And it’s so steep! They even have a warning sign. But the beach was amazing but the current where to strong so you couldn’t go deeper than your knees. "
jas l,60 contributions,Nov 2018,"Worth to come, even the road was bad. Still in progress for improvement as per the locals. i suggest u to hire rental car with guide so you can go to many location in 1 day!  motorcycle not so recommended, but if u like adventures ride u can try 😂 some of them get lost, can’t even find the place. not all the areas have telephones line. So my advice pay extra or u will waste all ur time & energy with the bump. "
Himawan Widyandaru,"Yogyakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Best views on nusa penida. tourist packed as expected. A very beautiful sights to see, beach is very beautiful but you need an extra stamina as the stairs to the bottom is very hard and only the one that has adrenaline that could do it. Instagram photo would be a nice purpose to visit this place, and road leads to this beach is great compare to other destination in nusa penida. Must visit indeed if you're tired with all bali chaos and kuta party scene :)"
atika s,21 contributions,Oct 2018,Its unbelievable. This place is totally amazing. Cant wait to visit it again. Don't be hesitate to ask people for the right direction. All of the locals are so friendly and nice.
ridhikh,"New Delhi, India",Oct 2018,"Must visit, if you are fit please go tho the bottom and swim in the most serene white sandy beaches. there are more than 700 steps to the bottom and then all the way up. the climb will easily take 2 hours even if you are fit"
Umesh N,"Bangkok, Thailand",Oct 2018,Most beautiful hues you can ever see. Worth the travel and must see if you are in Bali. Get a tour operator like Bali4U or directly go to Sanur beach where you can get a trip organised. Suggest you start early in the day. Pick one of the first speed boats around 7:30 or 8 and head to Nusa Penida. Better to take a hat and sunscreen as it can get quite hot and sunny
Jorden K,"Hamilton, Canada",Oct 2018,"During our three week vacation in the area of Bali, this site on Nusa Penida was undoubtedly my favourite. The view from the top was absolutely incredible. My girlfriend and I were feeling ambitious so we decided to trek down to the beach. This took approximately 40 minutes to get down as it was extremely hot and the “stairs” were quite steep. I put stairs quotations because it is in fact a narrow, steep, and uneven pathway made of jagged rocks and a hand-fashioned bamboo rail. The descent and climb back to the top were quite taxing and I would not encourage it for anyone with poor physical health.Unfortunately the beach is very wavy with strong currents so you are unable to fully get in to the water at the beach. There are drinks available at the beach but you will pay much more for them, so bring water."
Jojo_Travelers,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2018,"Klingking Beach so nice spot,you can going down but bit difficult steps going there just be careful.the beach nice and blue good for travelers!"
Lucien_LE,"Bry-sur-Marne, France",Oct 2018,"It's a beautiful spot, but there is much more to see in Nusa Penida...It is really crowded, really hard to take a decent picture without anybody on it.Better to go to Seganing waterfall, Saren Cliff Point...etc."
Laura The Explorer,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2018,Skip the tours to Nusa and head here for the day. You can trek down to the beach and really experience the scenery. Be aware that it is an hour and it not easy but it is worth it.
Bre,"Ontario, Canada",Apr 2018,"The most beautiful island coastline I've ever seen! We rented scooters on the island and the roads are so rough.. it was like mountain biking. I wiped out and broke the rearview mirrors and scratched the moped up a bit, but I only paid $20 CAD for the repairs so it wasn't too bad! I wouldn't recommend renting scooters, it would be best to have a driver, but the moment we did reach smooth roads (briefly), we were cruising along winding lush jungle roads with utmost freedom. Still, the roads were scary... I would hire a driver! Though it is still a bumpy ride."
Afiz4,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,"Came here under special package by crown tour. The time slot for each tour was too short, just enough to take photos. I will come again to swim and stay longer. The journey down to the beach is 1 hour from the top. The water looks pristine blue from the top. Definitely a sight to behold. I’ll be back! "
Lauren V,"Bornem, Belgium",Oct 2018,"The view is superb from upstairs.But downstairs it is just as pretty on the beach.The hike is sometimes challeging but with some decent shoes it's not that hard, it's tougher going up than down :). But there's always ""fences"" to hold on to.Definitely worth going down!The sea is rough so I would not go far in the water, there is a lifeguard who blows a whistle when someone is getting too far."
Bryonymbrand,Wigan,May 2018,"This was something I was most looking forward to doing during my trip to Bali and it definitely didn't disappoint, in fact, it's one of the best places I've ever visited.The hike down in the heat is tough, especially given the narrow and steep steps down, but it's certainly doable and it's so worth it. I'm a seasoned hiker so breezed it but my friend is the opposite end of the spectrum and still managed with a little assistance.We hired a guide mainly because we had no idea where it was but if you can find your way around the island without then you can do it alone. I would recommend doing it early morning as there's no shade what so ever and it's baking in the midday sun.When you make it to the beach it's beautiful, clean, quiet and what you'd expect to see in a James Bond movie. I could have spent all day there.Do not miss this!"
Nicolas P,"Lima, Peru",Oct 2018,"This place is pure beauty. Another wonder that mother nature has to offer ;) Energetic and breathtaking.CAUTION: avoid going down, it is very dangerous. One bad step and consequences can be terrible. Better to enjoy the view from top because a place like this doesn’t worth it to enjoy it under stress. Otherwise you are more focused in the climb down and up, so whats the point?  I had a really bad time because i didn’t know how hard it was and needed to come back half way down (and i consider myself very adventurous btw :o). Enjoy the view!! "
Nga N,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Oct 2018,"If you have enough time and condition of health is ok, you should get down to enjoy the beach. But the way get down is not easy at all. It takes an hour to get down and maybe more than an hour to get up again. Its really exhausted. There are many people giving up at ghe half way, included me. "
Julie L,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Oct 2018,"Kelingking beach have the good ways go to there, not hard ways like Angel Billabong's. Really nice place. I dont like to pay 5.000 rupiah for 1 person and 1000 rupiah parking ... If they earn money too much, they need to repair restroom public and the ways go down on the beach too. "
Billinda1964,3 contributions,Oct 2018,"One of the best and most terrifying experiences of my life... My boyfriend and I tackled the hike down to the beach at about 9am. Not too busy at this time but still people around. The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help. A lot of people will not be as lucky. Enjoy every minute but be safe and look after people around you. Really sad to hear about people drowning here and it happens far too often :( An amazing experience but very dangerous. :) "
Agnes Kumala D,31 contributions,Oct 2018,"To reached this location you must willing to be an explorer.. the road quite tough.. Google Map can helped u.. notes: please use Telkomsel as your phone providerIt can be reached using motorcycles buuut prepare your self to be expose with dust and bumpy road.. caution: the road conditions like a trail road😂U can rent a car with driver with cost IDR 500,00/ day. Well if you traveling with kids better rent car.The location is amazing! If you want to swim in the beach you have to hike extreme hills😂😂My hubby don’t allow me to did that😖 but I wish i did😔😔"
Katy S,3 contributions,Sep 2018,"This is one of the most beautiful place, which I ever saw.You can also walk down to the beach.I can recommend this place, if I will have a chance I would go again!"
DjaliDjali,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida. It requires good physical condition to go up, down and up again, especially under the tropical sun. It's located quite far, 1,5 hour approximately from Sampalan, the main port to reach Nusa Penida from Sanur. Because of its popularity, to avoid the crowd, I suggest you to be here around 8 am. The earliest fast boat leaves Sanur at 7.30 with 45 minutes travel duration. So people start coming from Bali main island from 10 am approx. It'd be ideal if you spend a night in Nusa Penida and arrive early in Kelingking beach. So you can enjoy the white sandy, secluded beach on your own for some time. You take steepy stairs to go down that only fit for one person. In the busy hours, people make quite long queue waiting to go up or down in turns, one by one. The shower room isn't available on the beach, it's on the cliff. You should pay 5000 IDR to use the shower room/toilet.I wonder how grand the view would be during sunset time. If you spend a night in Nusa Penida, you can try to watch sunset here. Altough the lack of street light and poor condition of asphalt in some parts throughout the journey would be a challenge.And dear my fellow travellers, please mind your trash. The waste management here hasn't been well developed. Bring home your garbage, avoid using plastic straw & buy the mineral water in big size (1L).Happy travelling"
Zach Reep,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2018,Need to come here & feel the wind blows with the beautifull scenery..the road a very bad..need extra carefull..to many off road and slick rock
Katie M,26 contributions,Oct 2018,"We took a motorbike to see some of Nusa Penida’s sights. We had read about the rocky off-roading it would take to get there, but since my partner is an experienced driver we thought we could handle it. Be warned, you’ll be going slowly and swerving around potholes, trucks on the wrong side, and walking your bike up slippery gravel. But in the end, it’s about the journey and this gorgeous view! Note, there are some restaurants for food and drinks at the vista. "
Andrew Black,"Newcastle, Australia",Oct 2018,This place is the best vista on Nusa Penida. I was concerned for the amount of rubbish there and over tourism.
Leuventripper,"Leuven, Belgium",Oct 2018,"I piss on everyone who doesn’t do the climb, but please be prepared. The sun is burning hot and the climb gets worse when you pass the middle to go to the beach. It’s very steep and a real challenge. Make sure to bring your own water because 1 bottle is 50,000r at the beach, and maybe some lunch. We enjoyed the hike a lot! Better not to do this with children.  Also mind the waves! They are big and very strong."
Ellen F,10 contributions,Oct 2018,"We visited Kelingking and took on the trek down the cliff edge to the beautiful beach below. As other reviewers have said you MUST wear appropriate shoes if you are taking this on. We saw many people struggling in flip flops and even saw one girl slip and fall, losing a flip flop through the gap in the fence that saved her. We wore Tevas sandals, sneakers would also be appropriate. If you're in good shape and don't mind a scramble, this should be fine for you. Avoid midday as heat can be unbearable. The worst thing (and my reason for four stars) is that the tides and waves are VERY strong. There are a few flags and a guy with a whistle but not much else to keep you safe. Would highly recommend this trip but we prepared to get dirty and tired! "
Tiny Naksha T,34 contributions,Sep 2018,"If you planing to visit Bali - Indonesia then don’t miss this place. Here are some points to make your plan easier for nusa penida.       1. You wish you can do day trip at Nusa penida or you can stay there also       2. Start your journey early at morning so you will able to catch boat      3. To Nusa Penida they have speed boat service with different timing form Sanur port, buy return ticket it will cost you near about $25/p ( there are many companies with different timing starting from 8:00am)      4. At Nusa penida you can rent bike for $5 or also you can hire 4 wheeler for $20/p         There are so many stunning places are there to explore like kelingking beach, broken island, angle bilabong, crystal bay.In kelinking beach if you wish you can go down also but path is not good at some point broken steps so be careful while getting down .. also make sure you have time because it will take almost 2hr or more to going down n come. "
snehalpatil3091,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2018,"If you are planing to visit Nusa Penida - Kelingking Beach, then follow this route for easiest and cheaper way — 1. Go to Sanur port and buy return ticket for nusa penida ( speed boat usually run in morning ) so be there as early as possible (try to reach 7:00 am ) 2. It will take 45 min to reach nusa penida 3. Try to hire 4 wheeler with driver or bike 4. Must visit kelingking beach , broken island , angle bilabong, crystal bay ( this all places is possible to cover in a day )   If you have time then you can go down in kelingking beach but road is very stiff and broken and it will take 1 hr to go down, so manage your time before you go down .. Top view of island is just breathtaking.. most beautiful view i ever seen .. if you are planing to visit Indonesia then dont miss this place .. !!"
CharlotteKirsch,"Reading, UK",Oct 2018,"The main viewpoint is incredible. There is a 5k entrance fee per person to get in to see the view. Once in there are bars, restaurants and shops if you want to stock up on any items. The viewpoint is so beautiful, but expect to wait in a queue for ‘the’ photo!If you plan to walk down to the beach then don’t wear flip flops and have sturdy shoes. The pathway isn’t very good!"
kayman99,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2018,T REX is only about 8 k's in a straight line from the port but it took close to an hour and a half to get there. The roads are the worst I have been on. Painful actually. A four wheel drive would struggle to get there. But once you do it is a beautiful beach as all the photos suggest. We went from there to Angels Billabong and the road was just as bad. Once again the beaches were amazing but if you don't want to sit in a hot car getting bumped around for hours I would avoid it.
meikadalton,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2018,"We stopped by and despite being surrounded by hordes of tourists, Kelingking is a stunning place to see. We didn't attempt the walk down based on the advice of our driver and after reading these reviews, I'm glad we didn't. Lovely spot for a photo opportunity. "
Soniaalp,"Reims, France",Oct 2018,Gorgeous view......But unfortunetely very touristic !! However this is a place to see when you are at Nusa Penida. 
Dawannes,"Hoogstraten, Belgium",May 2018,"This is a stone T. rex, when on the right spot, you can walk to the beach down there, but it’s scary "
sermar99,"Oakland Park, FL",Sep 2018,"It is not easy to get there, but the views are out of this planet.  Scotters, driving on a very bad roads, but if you are careful, you will make it.  Amazing view. Beach, ocean, mountains, and blue sky.  IF you go to Indonesia, do not miss this one."
osky1900,"San Juan, Puerto Rico",Oct 2018,"The views from the top of the cliff are amazing, the colour of the sea looks as if someone have filter it.But before you start to think about climbing down to the beach I'd like you to know that I did it and being on shape and exercising twice per week I'm not sure i'd repeat the tour Going down is dangerous because of the narrow and very rampped path which is ""secured"" very poorly with ropes and bamboo canes, in most of the steps you advance 3 meters down at least. It is most climbing than walking.But the main problem comes when you are at the beach and you have to climb up...it is exhausting. Bring sneakers and water with you. And becareful with the sea water. It is not a beach to have a quiet bath, the waves and strong water streams could make it impossible."
Explore820122,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2018,Located on the southern island of Nusa Penida from above it will look like a beautiful southern sea.the beauty of nature here will make us forget how hot the weather is here
Dream820525,7 contributions,Sep 2018,"Beautiful views, nature is just amazing. In case you want to go down, be sure to wear sneakers as the path is really narrow and rough. It probably takes you one hour or so to go all the way down to the beach. We only went half the way because we didn't have time and we had only flip flops with us."
Hannah G,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Sep 2018,"So worth the trip! Our driver took us on a tour of Angels Billabong, Broken Beach, Kelingking and Crystal Bay and it was a perfect day out. Roads are bumpy though so expect this. Our tour cost 650,000 total and we hired the driver from our hotel (Arsa Santhi)."
Jackson Lo,"New York City, NY",Sep 2018,"The journey here by road was rough, but in the end the breathtaking view cancels that all out. This is definitely a once in a lifetime experience."
Gimhani Kavindya Baduge,"London, UK",Aug 2018,Most beautiful spot to take pictures in bali.. after accidents happened recently they have put a stick fence... which makes it bit safe... however the place is so scenic and anyone visiting Bali should never miss this one.
Nusa Penida Exploration,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Sep 2018,It's very interesting and wonderful place to explore and experience the nature beauty of the Kelingking beach.
lifesabeach108,"South Devon, UK",Sep 2018,Absolutely incredible view a must when in Bali a short boat trip from sanur then lembongan And a very bumpy 1hr drive 
xxNiiaxx,"Wil, Switzerland",Sep 2018,amazing view - amazing landscape.. I'm still in love with this place :-) you could hike to the little beach below and it's absolutely worth it!

I also would not risk swimming in the ocean. could be used for that."
Alaksander,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2018,"The view itself is breathtaking. Take your time to take in the amazing view, bask in the sun and breathe in the sea breeze. Don't forget to look closely into the bay. We spotted 13 Mantas gliding the ocean waves freely.One of the most amazing views in Nusa Penida."
Sjur,"Bergen, Norway",Sep 2018,"A must see in Nusa Penida! The viev is amazing, you clearly see the t-rex head, and you also see manta rays swimming around down there. It's a tough walk down, but if you're up for it, then it's worth it. "
leashyjelly,"London, UK",Sep 2018,"Treacherous 45 minute walk/CLIMB down the cliff face. With nothing but branches and bamboo rails between you and 400m fall! The beach itself is gorgeous, lots of shady places to lounge while it cools down before you conquer the horrific walk back up. but the waves make it not great for swimming.with nothing but a “beach man” equipped with a long stick incase of emergencies i would never recommend end swimming here.Unfortunately while we were on the beach a local boy got swept out to sea and drowned while everyone watched helpless. His body did not resurface for 30 minutes when it was too late. Absolutely tragic so again i stress DO NOT SWIM here. "
articx6,85 contributions,Oct 2017,"The journey is quite tough due to road condition. I almost surrender.... lol, but the view.. wow, spectacular!!!"
Sonya March,63 contributions,Apr 2018,Dinosaur 🦖 cave ever!!! This is my first destination when I was in Bali. You can walked to the beach down there just 1 hrs. Although I went on summertime but is not too hot . Cool breeze and summer fresh air. Superb!!!!
Drizzels,"Leuven, Belgium",Sep 2018,"Yes its true, the road is terrible. But only like max 1km. We went around 11am and there were almost no other vehicles on the road so you can use the whole road and choose the best path. Take your time and it's absolutely doable with a scooter. The view itself is beautiful and worth the drive. It gets crowded really quick so go as early as possible. We left around 12.30pm and all the busses with tourists were getting dropped off. "
Greeshma96777,14 contributions,Sep 2018,"It is the best view one will see while visiting Bali.  Palm for atleast half a day.  Trekking down to the beach takes some toll and one needs to be reasonably fit to trek down to reach the beach. Do carry few Bintangs in the back back,  trek down and enjoy s yourself in the beach"
Am_miri-am_miri,46 contributions,Sep 2018,if you want to get down to the beach - please wear good shoes! Otherwise it can get quite tricky I guess (I watched other people's faces)
AlunHutoyo,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"All the bumpy roads to get here was worth it. If you are not an expert motorbike rider, you better get a car rent and driver. Bring along your hiking shoes/sandals to going down the beach. The view from above was spectacular and the cliff looks like tyrannosaur 😁"
CaiaCam,"Fontana, CA",Aug 2018,"challenging and steep 1 Km hike to the bottom, but worth it. Don't go if you have a fear of heights. And wear sneakers. Don't forget your snorkel.  It costs money to use the toilet, but I think the fee is included with most tours."
Elli,Norway,Feb 2018,"The place is absolutely stunning. The earlier the better, I think in a couple of years it will be too crowdy and touristy.A must see if you are  at nusa penida. The road to it is horrible though. "
Jerre_Stead,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"Kelingking Beach is one of the best beaches on Nusa Penida, you can easily get here by motorbike but be careful as most the roads on the small island can be a little rough. There is a small fee for parking as most scenic places. There are small snack shops and places to buy a beer at the top. The trip down the trail can be a bit much for some people as it is steep and the railings are just old pieces of bamboo tied together so go slow if you're not comfortable. The beach at the bottom is amazing but be careful as the waves can get pretty intense! Most of all have fun and takes pictures of this amazing place!!"
Mohd Edzle,"Sungai Buluh, Malaysia",Sep 2018,If you’re in Bali.. I recommend you to come to this place. For sure you had unbelievable experience here
Joko P,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2018,"so beautiful view from the top, many photo spot, but for some of the best they will charge you Rp.5.000. better you come early, before 9 am, if you not you will see a crowded photo spot and long cueing to go down."
Melissa B,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Jun 2018,"Breath taking views from the top and if you choose to walk down... you're in for an adrenaline rush to say the least! The narrow walkway down is ""fenced"" with bamboo and some parts are damn near vertical that steps have been cut into the rock. Ironically, we walked down in bare feet as jandals (flip flops) felt far too unsafe. Once down at the beach you could go for a swim however we found the powerful swell intimating so only dipped our feet. Back at the top there are places to buy cold drinks (lifesaver! lol) The whole experience of the views and the walk itself was a highlight of our Bali trip."
Stevo,83 contributions,May 2018,"I am not easily impressed. But seeing this had staring with my mouth opened and goosebumps on my skin. The waves down there look like they are moving in slow motion. It was quite an adventure to ride my rented scooter up there through all those curves in the hills. But totally worth it. If Bali is on your list, this should be a point of interest!"
Caleymay,"Seongnam, South Korea",Sep 2018,"This cliff face offers an amazing view point of the beach below. We didn't hike down there as its a LONG walk down and up!! However, definitely visit for the view as its spectacular!!"
Dazhetho,"Newcastle, Australia",Sep 2018,Left Lembongan on boat to do snorkelling and then dropped off at Crystal Bay to make a 1hr drive to see this. Bloody great and amazing.
Manon S,12 contributions,Sep 2018,"The view and the beach are amazing! This is wonderful. Magical view Clear sea, white sand, sun... how to spend a perfect day!"
Evelyn K,Singapore,Sep 2018,"Really marvellous view from the top. On a sunny day, its really what you see in pictures. Crowded. So good luck in trying to get a picture without others in it. Its amazing how a tourism industry is set up because of a pretty sight.. there are many warungs at the site with many stalls set up selling drinks and coconut. "
Tiia T,"Helsinki, Finland",Sep 2018,"We visited Kelinking Beach during the evening, when the sun was setting around 6 PM. The views looked just awesome and T-Rex was cute as hell! It's incredible how nature has created something this beautiful. So if you are in Nusa Penida, you should check this out. If you are afraid of heights, be aware. Although it seems like it's so high you just can't even realize anymore how high it is. We didn't go down the stairs, since there were a lot of people. There were lot of tourists on top of the beack too, but not so many that you couldn't just take in the views and enjoy.There are some scams (at least they feel like scams) on the beach by locals, so be aware. Our guide actually adviced us couple of times to climb ladders into this little wooden thing, where you could take selfies with a better view. So we did althought the wooden thing didn't look so special. When we came down, the local lady was asking us for 5 k per person. It was written with a shaky handwriting on a very little sign next to the ladders. We paid, as it isn't that much, but I just felt fooled. I feel like this kind of ""take a picture here and pay 5/10 k"" are just one big scam. Entrance fees are okay if the proceeds go into the maintenance/property management, but otherwise... Please stop, this is not that appealing to tourists since it lefts you only with a feeling of being fooled."
Mark Joven,"Quezon City, Philippines",Sep 2018,I have to say my favorite spot in Nusa Penida island and worth going especially if you’ll have time going down to the beach. The view from the top is amazing ans I’m pretty sure the experience going down the beach would be amazing. If you’re afraid of heights then try to be brave and strong if you want to have a perfect Instagram shot because by just merely sitting at the cliff is nerve braking. It’s really beautiful and it made me want to come back to Bali ASAP. You should try it and i tell you it’s worth it 
Cioarba H,"Reghin, Romania",Sep 2018,Nusa Penida Island is a place that you have to see beaxuse is very wild. There are not so many buildings and you can see a lot of tropical forest. 
Arlene J,"Jersey City, NJ",Sep 2018,This beach was beautiful! We did not venture down to the bottom but many people did. It is definitely a must see in Bali. Such an amazing view from the top! 
David R,43 contributions,Aug 2018,"I still don't think I've seen something that spectacular anywhere else in the world. It's getting more and more touristic, yes, but because of obvious reasons..."
Nyein Ei Ei L,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",Aug 2018,"It is an highlight of Nusa Penida. It is just wonderful place. I hired a car and I need to pass steep and bumpy road to get this amazing place. But when I get there, I forgot everything and just amazed by this wonder. I really really loved it."
Pinkieferris,76 contributions,Sep 2018,Kelingking Beach was the first stop on my tour of the east coast of this natural wonder of Nusa Penida and the views of Kelingking  beach were spectacular - if you’re brave enough navigate your way down the staircase for about 25 minutes and see the stunning beach up close and personal. Not to be missed if you visit the island! 
sedigheh_kh,Iran,Aug 2018,"Stunning view but crowded, full of tourist and if you want to take a photo you should wait for long .But breath taking view.You have to visit this place as the best part of nusa penidaa."
samareaiya,"Kandy, Sri Lanka",Jul 2018,This is the best out of all remarkable places in Nusa Penida Island. It’s simply out of this world. A must visit place if you are Bali.
Dana P,"Bangkok, Thailand",Aug 2018,"It is where heaven and hell meet. The beach is heavenly and offers a natural shade under what seems to be a cave. Water is a mix of blue and green, huge waves and white sands. However reaching the beach itself is hell, a very difficult road down a big mountain. I think it’s worth it but make sure you have enough time down there. "
NatashaT91,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2018,"We woke up at 6AM specifically so that we could have the place to ourselves, and we are so happy we did. Beautiful views, and easy trek down and up. Spent some time by the beach and marveled at the huge waves. By the time we were nearing the top again (around 9AM) the stairs started to get really busy, which seemed like a nightmare (there's really only room for one person at a time). I think it would have been a totally different experience if we had left later.Also I think there are weird parking (scams?) that make you pay if you arrive later. We found them all over Penida, but they weren't around in the morning."
Samantha M,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2018,"Riding a 2 wheeler motor bike to get to these locations by yourself is very tricky, the roads are so bad!! we had a fall on one of the roads and we happened to be the 4th biker that had a fall on that same stretch, luckily we were not as badly injured as the others so we managed to proceed with caution towards our destination as the roads just kept getting worse in condition - unless you are staying overnight on nusa penida ensure you make it back to the ferry port on time for the last boat atleast (we made it just in time with 2 minutes to spare) - once you arrive nusa penida by boat best hire a local biker and let him ride / hire a car.Kelingking - pay for parking - no entry fee - lot of stamina needed - you have to wonder how those bamboo stick fences were even built by some really really brave hearts!! you have to shuffle through people on your way down as many stop in between contemplating if they should continue further. we stopped half way ourselves and did not make it to the beach as we had to race back to the port to make it in time for our boat! but i am sure it would have been a very private beach as not many go right to the bottom. The view is breathtaking & the experience is exhilarating so expect to be tired at the end of this."
bharti7980,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2018,Just a short half hour drive from Angel billabong.. This place offers stunning views. Also the road is well maintained.  Our driver dropped us at the top to get the views.. However you can also walk down the stairs to reach the bottom Sandy beach.. 
Christian W,"Hamburg, Germany",Feb 2018,"One of many Highlights in Nusa Penida.The way to this scenic view was rough - it took us a lot of skill with our bikes to go there, but it was fun! At the end, we had a great view on the famous T-Rex ;) I was flying my drone to get some great shots (since my girlfriend was too afraid to climb the ""stairs"" down the hill). On good days you can see the Mantas in the Manta Point!!Do it - it's worth the effort!"
Staffan N,"Stockholm, Sweden",Aug 2018,"For sure, this place is nice but be prepared to push your way through a bunch of people. Be careful as there no fence that will stop you to fall 100 meters...Be prepared to stand in line for some minutes to get to the spot where you can take the best picture. Going down to the beach and up will take 2 hours.Seems like this place attracts a lot of Chinese people, so you might want to be prepared for that as well... "
akshaymay2981,"Raipur, India",Aug 2018,"It took me 20 mins to walk bare foot down a steep inclined of rocks with only a woobly bamboo railing as safety . The returned journey took me 50 mins of walking ,as I struggled with exhaustion , Intense heat and dizziness as well as trying to step back up on rocks larger than the legs of mine . "
Miguel Grech,"Island of Malta, Malta",Jul 2018,amazing experience & stunning view.. a paradise on earth.. rly enjoyed watching the mantras swimming  
WanderingAmbitions,"London, UK",Aug 2018,"Absolutely stunning beach and a must see. My poor rating comes down to the rubbish littered around, lines of instagrammers and the stalls which somewhat dampens the experience.To get down to the beach is tough hike, you can see manta rays if you look off the cliff to the left side (when looking at the sea) and the road is bumpy but manageable if on scooter."
duzelpanda,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2018,Your must-visit bucket list at Nusa Penida. This place will be full of tourists in the afternoon so you'd better reach this place in the early morning or late evening to get the best picture. You also need an extra stamina to reach the beach down there.
MikeandSandra7,Melbourne,Aug 2018,Yes to arrive at this destination you will travel on the worst road on Nusa Penida. I ride motorbikes back home and are confident on a scooter but we decided to enjoy the scenery on the way in so we hired a driver. The views from the top are absolutely stunning on a clear day and make for some great photos. If you want to walk down the steps for ‘that photo’ then be prepared to wait in line. This is another place where you want to arrive as early as possible. As we were leaving there was a constant stream of vehicles arriving.When walking back to the car park keep looking out to the ocean as we say around 7 Manta Rays swimming in the clear blue waters below. Also buy some bananas from the local vendors and feed the local monkeys. If you come all the way to Nusa Penida you need to come here.
Domrand,78 contributions,Aug 2018,"This place is absolutely beautiful the water is so blue and the view is breathtaking just be aware if you’re going to hike down to the beach it’s more of a Rock climb than I hike, wear suitable footwear and bring some water! There is a little stall at the bottom that sells drinks but there soooo expensive! (50k for a bottle of water) And be careful in the waves as they are extremely powerful"
TravelAngler725,"Seoul, South Korea",Aug 2018,"Kelingking is most famous for looking like the shape of a t rex, but once you've gone down to the beach, you will remember this hike for the grueling, yet rewarding, experience it truly is. A few disclaimers. Do not hike using slippers. You are better off going barefoot, which is what I did, or using some serious hinking shoes. Check the bamboo before you pull yourself up. It is not all sturdy. Above all go slowly, be in good physical condition and you will be fine. If you aren't up to the journey you can enjoy the spectacular views. WhenI went, there was a school of large fish easily visible from the cliff. If you do make the journey, reward yourself with a refreshing soak in the ocean (and powerful waves that come with it!)"
Melissa R,26 contributions,Feb 2018,"The way down to the beach was closed when we went, but some ignored the sign and went down anyways. It's really steep and there are no real stairs or anything. We just went for the picture and that's all you can really do there. It's pretty, but becoming cliche. "
Heine K,"Trondheim, Norway",Aug 2018,"Getting down is not recommended if you're not in shape or afraid of heights. Even if you are, take care and make sure your footing is good.The trip down is an experience in itself, but so worth it. Most beautiful beach I've been to."
MaggieStar,"Malmö, Sweden",Aug 2018,"The road there is terrible, pls be careful. Go slowly, no rush. The view is amazing. The walk down and up the beach is really hard and difficult. Up is like crawling or rockclimbing. 45min each way. Pls wear sneakers for your own safety. The Beach is like paradise, but strong current and Waves. Def worth a visit!"
I3eren,"Stuttgart, Germany",Aug 2018,"That is the best beach on Nusa Penida, a real paradise, but you should be careful when going down. For us it was no problem, because we had trailrunning shoes, but i think its only a matter of time until someone with flip flops will slip and might get hurt. There always is a kind of „fence“ made of sticks, bound together with ropes, that is really solid. So you can do it, but be careful!"
Nerina P,"Santorini, Greece",Aug 2018,"Best place to see. Amazing view! Paradise! Trip to the beach is about1.30 min down and up. Stairs are preaty steep, we didn't go down. A must see! "
ljprocter,"Royal Tunbridge Wells, UK",Jul 2018,It is quite a hike to down to the breathtaking white sand beach at the bottom of the TRex shaped cliff formation but it is important to note that the view from above is just as spectacular. Top Tip: try and find your own little viewpoint not where the crowd is.
langelino,"Stormville, NY",Jul 2018,"Got there first thing in the morning, was not crowded yet, but I can see it getting packed.  If you want to go down to the beach you need very good shoes, and probably an hour to get down, not easy."
Dinushka U,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Jun 2018,"If you visit Bali, this is must visit place. Beautiful view and once you climb down, you will see the beautiful beach with clear water. "
Thomas B,5 contributions,Aug 2018,We came early (9 am) and avoidet the crowds on our way down which was very nice considering the narrow and at times pretty vertical hike. Bring practical shoes and bags - and be aware of the tides.So beautiful!
David O,"Yerevan, Armenia",Aug 2018,We had a long way to the Kelingking beach and we were tired but the view was amazing and the beach itself was great. Must see place for me.
chad w,"Helena, MT",May 2018,The view from top overlooking Kelingking  was great.  The travel via scooter getting to this location was a adventure with good roads and bad roads..the last 15 minutes were worst(dirt road and very bumpy and poor) getting to this location:  This is becoming popular place to see so there was quite a few tour groups and vehicles when you get close to this location.   The hike to Beach below was extreme and I thought to myself after I got halfway down this is going to get easier now.  Ha Ha.  It was more intense (I thought if you fall you will die steep with only bamboo strapped railing next to path down) It got much hotter on lower half as well in afternoon.     (Hint bring water and good shoes)   The beach on bottom was amazing with perfect sand and perfect water.  The hike out was not as bad as hike in since its easier to climb then descend since you can use your hands.  It was worth the hike but I would not do this again since it was difficult and I climb to top of mountains where I live a lot.
jrox1,"Hartford, CT",Jul 2018,"We visited Kelingking Beach with Discover Nusa Penida's Manta Mix Tour - it is truly a must-see.  We did not hike down to the beach, as we wanted to see other sites in our afternoon tour, but the view from the top is beautiful.  We could see mantas swimming in the bay from the cliff!"
Tonykhoa,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Jul 2018,"OMG, so nice and so beautiful. I do not know why, it's so beautiful. Really just know it is very beautiful, and wonderful. You have to live here once in your life. to see, to see the real beauty of it"
becky1007,"Stockholm, Sweden",Jul 2018,"We visited Kelingking when the weather was really bad, and our hotel & guide told us to not go down to the beach under any circumstances. Worth baring in mind when planning your trip.We ventured down the stairs a little way, but is probably not suitable for families with young children, as we struggled with climbing down and back up. They aren't properly built stairs, its dug out into the cliff face, with bamboo as handrails thats not secure in some places, and very VERY steep.The views from the top are amazing though, though the waves were bad it was a clear day and we could see for miles! Also worth baring in mind how youre getting to Kelingking, as the roads are the worst! After speaking to other travellers they recommended getting a car there instead of riding the scooters there, and we're glad we listened! The road was broken in quite a few places, and some places it was just gravel!Beautiful place though, would recommend "
456ollis,4 contributions,Jul 2018,"Advice, pack sneakers! Great view, hazardous journey. Don't go here wearing flip flops. Also, have a backpack and water. "
Thiago F,"Heathcote, Australia",Jul 2018,"The Place is stunning, amazing view, beautiful nature, the colours are spectacular!  Definitely you need to visit this spot, but get ready to adventure, go down to the beach is not an easy task, you have to go down through a narrow path of stairs built from sticks and mud, and sometimes theres is traffic on your way down, because of the crescent number of tourists visiting the place!!"
Fabienne A,32 contributions,Jul 2018,Must see on Nusa Penida! Very impressiv! Next to the most hotspots on Nusa Penida. Would recommend to go by car due to the difficult streets.
e-hewitt1,"Laholm, Sweden",Jun 2018,The ocean was every shade of blue and turquoise possible. It was so lovely but the climb was sweaty but definitely worth it.
Matt D,"Modave, Belgium",Jul 2018,"Lovely place, very nice pictures there. But go further than that and take your time to visit the South of the island too. It's worth it and you will see more than the 2 touristic places everyone goes to."
sunridge8,"Palmwoods, Australia",Jul 2018,"The view is spectacular but the road out to here is horrendous. We hired a driver and felt very sorry for anyone who attempted it on a scooter. Also if you can go early you will be rewarded with lighter crowds. We didn't attempt the stairs down to the divine beach, but if you are brave enough to face the 'stairs' then you would love the beach area."
Trav,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,"Kelingking beach is just something you have to see to believe, it is amazing. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the manta rays swimming around at the beach below. A few things to note:The road out to Kelingking is rough, if you decide to do it on a scooter you should be careful as there are a lot of bumps, rocks, soft sand and taxis to contend with. I have heard that the taxi/tour van ride out is quite rough also but if you aren't confident on a scooter then I suggest taking a tour or taxi.This is the number one attraction on Nusa Penida so it gets very busy, if you stay on the island I recommend going early before the boats bring in day tourists.The best view is from the top, but you can hike down to the beach but be warned that it is not an easy one, I recommend wearing sneakers/runners for extra grip and just for feet protection.Areas of the hike down are super steep and quite difficult to negotiate so take your time. Plenty of people do this hike so there are sections where you will have to stop and wait to let people pass you. Be considerate of others and lend them a hand when it's safe to do so. This is a cliffs side you are climbing down which has little shade and sometimes no wind so it gets very hot. Once you make it down to the beach, there is one person who is selling some drinks and snacks but don't expect to have a wide variety and you will pay slightly more then you would normally. It would be wise to take some water and snacks with you. The beach is not necessarily a swim friendly beach, no life guards patrol the beach, the waves can be quite big and come from different directions. If you aren't a strong swimmer I highly advise you don't go in very deep. I swam out into the water and got to swim with some rays which was awesome. It was hard to get in and out safely and I am a strong swimmer.This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so if you do decide to do it. Be safe, take your time and take your rubbish with you. "
WinduRadityo,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"I went to Nusa Penida recently, and my tour guide bring me to this spot on the first time. I only take a few pictures from above, it's so beautiful. We can see a clear sea-view and you can look mantaray from above.The landscape just like a view from Jurrasic World the movie. The small island  so iconic.  I don't explore too much in this area. "
peeacee,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jul 2018,"Get your butt out there, do the tiring hike down and back up. Just wow. The views are AMAZING. Parking around the corner is free but parking on site is 5000 or 10000 IDR for motorbike. If anything, I feel like the money should go towards the maintenance of the walkway down. THe local people deserve to be paid for that incredible work :)"
chris m,7 contributions,Jun 2018,"Quite a walk down a narrow trail, but well worth the beautiful beach.  Go snorkeling with the Nusa Penida Tour group.  They are the best!"
YadnyaBali,"Ungasan, Indonesia",Oct 2017,For those who manage to climb 400 meters down will find extraordinary experience. Very secluded and amazing cliffs surrounding. Beware of the waves not recommended for swimming for beginners
amy j,"Shah Alam, Malaysia",Jun 2018,"I love the view! Every bit of it. It’s just too many tourist. And to get there is a bit complicated. I don’t really suggest you guys to go there by scooter. The road is not as what you expected. If you want to hike down the beach, make sure you wear a suitable shoes. The duration is about 2 hours. Maybe 1 hour if you’re a hiker. "
52mahesha,16 contributions,Jul 2018,Very nice place .. beautiful view .. lovely place.. u need to walk down the stair to get to the beach for half hour.. but overall very good view .. good place take some photo for memories..
Wasim Shaikh,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2017,"It is the most breathtaking view of sea beach and mountain. The path to beach is very dangerous, if you are expert in trekking you should not miss the opportunity of going down the hill to enjoy the beach with crystal clear sand and water all for only yourself. You can see the stingray fish in this place. Most attractive spot in Nusa Penida. Hotels and restaurants are coming up, pack your meals if you intend to spend the day in Kelingking beach. "
Johan Kinoshita,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"The Place is very picturesque with the T-Rex shaped rocks. You can go down the hill and play the beach, it’s pretty steep but really good beach! The water is crystal clear and there is abundant manta! Great place to go afternoon and watch sunset. Entry fee per car 10k"
MariaVania,Sydney,Jun 2018,"Climbing down and up the cliff is not for the faint hearted so be warned, bring water, sunscreen and a hat. The beach however is stunning!"
Paul M,"Cape Town, South Africa",Jul 2018,A real sight to behold. The litter all around is an absolute disgrace. A real sad reflection on the visitors! The local authority should increase the meagre surcharge for touring vehicles to enter and use this to train staff to manage the area and enforce anti littering with stringent fines with the added benefit of creating jobs for local villagers 
SANDRA K,8 contributions,Jun 2018,Its really amazing..to go there you need transportation..its a bit difficult to get there.better when you arrived in nusa penida rent a car or bike.
caseylim1990,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2018,This place is just amazing!!! The cliffs and the sea. Went over on a scooter and the road condition was good. Only regret was we didn't have enough time to hike down the cliff to get to the beach. Will definitely be back and head down to the beach for a dip!
yugraj s,8 contributions,Jun 2018,"Astonishing view of not just the T rex pount but also of few of the cliffs on the opposite side, on eof them being banah cliff in the sea. It has a wonderful beach down there but with some dangerous waves, and the way down is quite adventurous , i wouldn’t say too dangerous because its not a long way down or up, its steep but a lot of old people were able to go through it, but yes beach and the view is magnificent but comes with some really dangerous waves. "
Magnus Jensen,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Jul 2018,"We were two danish guys going to Kelingking Beach. We had heard great stuff about the tourist attraction, but got quite surprised anyway. First of all, the trip down the hill was steeper and more difficult than we expected. However, we managed to get down, which is the most challenging way, in 30 min. and it was totally worth it. The beach is beautiful and the water crystal clear. Moreover, it has to be said that it took us 12 min. to get up again. So if you consider going to Kelingking Beach, we will definitely recommend it even though it requires that you are not afraid of getting sweaty. "
cent629,"Dallas, TX",Jun 2018,"The most incredible views from the top, on the way down and on the beach. Went down with my 12 year old son and 15 year old daughter. Almost vertical decent in some places but there is a lot of bamboo structure to hold on to the whole way. About 20 mins down and probably a bit frightening for most in some places. The beach is incredible and secluded. The way up is much more strenuous but not as worrysome. If you can handle it, its well worth the journey."
GolakaNath,"Mumbai, India",Jun 2018,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here. From Kelingking cliff we drove to Crystal Bay to see the sunset."
Khadija K,34 contributions,Jun 2018,The journey to get to Kelingking beach is very rough. Do not take a bike you will have a difficult time. If you have a toddler this journey may get tricky. However once you reach the view is amazing. Beautiful rock formation and the colour of the sea is breathtaking. It’s difficult and dangerous to go down to the beach and we were happy seeing the view from the top.
checkit048,"Kyoto Prefecture, Japan",Jun 2018,"景色の凄さに圧倒されました青い海、青い空、切り立った崖と緑。全てが一体になっており、感動しましたI was impressed with the nature here. The blue osean, blue sky and high cliff, all was able to feel. I can't write the word to here.I recommend you visit here.見に行って良かったです観光客も多く、写真撮影を待っている間に景色を堪能できました(待ち時間 5分位)下まで降りることもできますが、自己責任とのこと売店、トイレも駐車場にありました"
Desmoon K,2 contributions,May 2018,"if you really want to have unforgettable experience, try the motorcycle when you are on the Nusa Penida island. the challenge is the road condition, you need some skills on some spots to balance your ride on some rocky, dusty road. along the riding, you can enjoy the viewit will take an hour from the harbor. don't afraid of getting lost, you can use GPS. it is suggested for a day trip, to start from Kelingking Beach then go to other spots and make Crystal Bay as the last spot before turning to the harbor. the last speed boat will be at 5 PM. and yes start early in the morning by taking first speed boat schedule from Sanur Beach. The Sanur beach will be very crowded, be there 30 minutes prior the departure as you will need sometimes to find the meeting point between the crowd. Kelingking Beach will give you amazing view! you can go down the beach but will take some efforts. easy to go down there but really challenging when going up. for the famous spot to take the kelingking beach that you usually see on Instagram, if it's in peak season, probably you will get in line for taking pictures as so many people want to take picture."
Ana P,"Luxor, Egypt",Jun 2018,Kelingking Beach has an amazing view!! But they never tell that you will need almost 1 hour in a terrible pathway to reach it by car. So if you have a young child... I would not recommend it! 
chiarabarrasso,"Paris, France",Jun 2018,"Kelingking beach is clearly one of the most beautiful place I have ever seen! The view on the beach is breathtaking! You can even see the Manta raies swimming in the crystal water! Also you can go down to the beach, a beautiful beach with white sand! It will take you 30 min but it worths it!"
FoodVenturer,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2018,"We went here on the first day of our visit in Nusa Penida this Jun and it was the most surreal experience. The place was crawling with tourists but it didn’t bother us because the view was breathtaking. We wanted to go down the beach but it was pretty far away and we didn’t wear the appropriate shoes (I only had sandals on). If you wish to go down to the beautiful beach below, make sure you wear sport shoes to be safe. Going down would be not that difficult (as long as you’re careful) but getting up would be an ultra long and tiresome journey, so make sure you have enough water and energy when you come here.I really hope to go down on my next visit!"
OrestePaven,"Cluj-Napoca, Romania",Jun 2018,"The beach is fantastic, even though we had not been down and we regret it. Definetly a must in Nusa Penida. There is full of people but you can find the space for yourself."
Zeeshan D,"New Delhi, India",Jun 2018,"We left our hotel at 730 am to beat the tour traffic and boy were we right! Took us an hour since it also rained a bit on the way. The Trex can be viewed from the view point which is right at the parking spot. But if you’re physically fit and adventurous, take the hike down the scary wood plank stairway to the beach!It was the most wonderful experience after a gruelling 30 minute hike down to see how empty and untouched the beach was. Pure natural beauty at its finest. You can go for a dip but the tide was strong. There is also surprisingly, a vendor who comes down around 845 am with snacks and drinks that you can buy from. Overall- PENIDA was made worth the money and effort solely because of this natural wonder"
Fatin,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Jun 2018,One of my favorite view! Amazing view from the beach and top. Be careful going up and down. If you are not fit dont worry. Just hold all this woods around you. Very big wave! Few tourist trying to swim but this big wave can pull you back into the water! Its worth it and you should try it one time in your life!! 
bunartowu,3 contributions,Jun 2018,"The view from the hilltop is nice and all. But the fun begins when u descend the hills to the beach below. It is tiring and hard, but totally worth it! Make sure u bring enough water with you to descend and to climb back up! And don't wear slippers because I have seen many slippers snapped along the way."
Cecilie C,"Valby, Denmark",Jun 2018,We enjoyed the view and took the trek down halfway. We also saw mantas swimming around at the bottom. Highly recommend it. Luckily most of the rude tourists dont go that far down the trek and you get some quite time ;) 
Zdeněk K,19 contributions,Jun 2018,"Just wow, thing place has one of the best views, which I enjoyed as much as I can. Beautiful art of nature!"
Van T,"Helsinki, Finland",Jun 2018,"This is a must-see when you're on Nusa Penida. I love how easy it was to get to this place. The roads were much better than the ones to Broken Beach. With a small parking price for my scooter (5000 Rupiah), I could enter the area. The view from the top was spectacular. But I enjoyed even more the stairs down the ""T-rex's back"" to the beach. Some people may find it quite challenging but to me it was really fun. "
asriniruth,Indonesia,Jun 2018,"This is so beautiful and amazing view, and definitely the must-see place when you visit Nusa Penida.So majestic and breathtaking view. Love it!"
enru s,3 contributions,Apr 2018,"It's like 1,5 to 2 hours from the Nusa Penidas's ferry harbor, to reach there you also have to go through 1 hour of bumpy roads, not quite a suitable destination if you bring a baby.From above it's an epic view.There's a hidden beach below but going down is rather extreme, just be careful not to slip"
Varun Saxena,"Bengaluru, India",Jun 2018,The view is beautiful from the top but its a treacherous hike down to the beach. Not for the faint-hearted. But worth going even if you see it from the top.
temitravel,"Quebec City, Canada",Jun 2018,Pictures don't do this place justice. Hike down to the beach. Stay the night in Nusa Peneda and come early or near sunset to avoid the crowds of people posing for instagram selfies.
Rirukunir,"Tangerang, Indonesia",May 2018,"It's really amazing when you reach this place. We just like see heaven and paradise. The shape of cliff like a T-Rex which is very interesting. Blue ocean is the view in front of the cliff, very clear and clean beach. 😍😍😍Actually we can go down for swimming activity or just taking photo in the beach instead of on top of the cliff, but it needs around 1 hour by walking down. Since I'm in a rush of hour to go other places, maybe next time I'll do it.Overall, it takes around 30 min from Nusa Penida port to Kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do off-road. So, I'd suggest that a pregnant woman to do not join this trip due to safety reason. Hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. 🙏🏻Besides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited. According to my local guide, there's only 1 star hotel near the Nusa Penida port. The others are only available for bungalows and homestay."
ongko_budihartanto,15 contributions,Jun 2018,It's a very extra ordinary place for us. The view was so amazing not only to take the extra ordinary pictures but also the extra ordinary experience. Because you will get both the views of beach from very high cliff and also the views of the very beautiful beach down the cliffs.
Rituraj B,16 contributions,Jun 2018,Amazing view but it was too much crowded. One of the beaches you can visit while you are staying in Lembongan or Penida. 
mitageorge,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2018,"This my first time went to this iconic beach. And this is one of my wishlist in penida,unfortunately due to time limitation i didn't go to reach the sand because it really need a big effort. But they said it worth to get the beach,next trip i have to reach the sand!! 😃😃😃"
Алекс М,"Nha Trang, Vietnam",Jun 2018,Better and closer than Atuh beach. Ferry service is terrible and spoiled all emotions of visiting. If you already at Nusa Penida it must be visited. But I do not advice go Nusa Penida at all
dean c,"Eaton, Australia",Jun 2018,"Hhmmm this ones hard, if ur super fit go for it , if not then move on... Wat u have to do is a long drive off the main island road to start with, then u turn left onto the “goat road” and very steep only try this on a scooter if u Know how to ride... after a cpl of kms of bumpy steep track u get to a bit where even the locals tell u Park here it’s too dangerous to take scooter past this point ... we’ll after all that ur about  half way there, then U have to slip an slide down more steep hills just to get to the Stairs, then the fun starts   There’s hundreds of stairs to get down to the Half way point ..... but if u succeed in making it this far u will be rewarded with an oasis of a Freshwater swimming hole that is Fantastic frickin awesome!!!!!! And the after chillin in the rock billabong and u still have more energy u can continue down more steps to the beach But don’t surprised if there isn’t any beach cause the tide comes in very quickly .... Now the reeeal  fun bit starts all over again, u thought coming down 100’s of steps was fun .... try going back up , then the slippery path, then back on the scooter for uphill goat track adventure ..... But if u finally make it back out alive, I guarantee u the only thing Ull  remember is that bloody awesome Freshwater swimming hole and cliffs around it .... Good luck 😉.  Ull need it "
DSN68,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,a bit scary to go down but it is amazing to make it. Definitely recommend to come. Need to improve some security for tourists
Megan E,29 contributions,Jun 2018,Had been looking forward to going to this location for over 8 months as all of my favorite travel bloggers have been here. I wasn’t expecting the waters to be as blue as in pictures figuring they had all been filtered. I am telling you it looks even better in real life. The water is so so blue and the cliffs are beautiful! We hiked all the way down to the bottom and it was tough but worth it. Bring water though because coming back up was tough. Such an amazing spot on this island. 
aurelie S,12 contributions,Jun 2018,"Going to Kelinking beach is quite an experience. First the road to get there is in really bad condition. So if you are not comfortable with a motor bike, choose a trip with a driver.And if you decide to take the stairs down to the beach, be careful the descent is not easy. You better pack light, and be prepare for a steep climb back.But the view is stunning from the top and once on the beach, you feel like you are in a little paradise."
Thea M,25 contributions,Jun 2018,"Kelingking Beach has an incredible view! It's a  must see in Nusa Penida. You'll need to take a boat ride of around 45 mins from Sanur to Nusa Penida. From there, it's about 1.5 hour drive to kelingking beach. It is an extremely bumpy ride so I recommend you to take medicine if you have motion sickness. The beach is about 1-1.5 hour hike and is very steep."
PK Das,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,"The beauty of this place is simply heaven on earth. Extremely beautiful & scenic. Unfortunately the access to the beach down is not comfortable at all. This is the one place one should visit Nusa Penida & also try to reach the beach down.Time for the Government to seriously think about building the access to the beach, may be an Elevator with fee would be a good option."
Kelli M,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Jun 2018,Kelingking Beach is stunning. Turquoise waters and white sand. From the top you can see the whole beach. We weren’t game to try the walk down to the beach but there were a few people who did. It is not for the faint of heart some people needed to be rescued while we were there. Definitely add this to your list when visiting Nusa Penida
Thom P,"Bovenkarspel, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"The views here are gorgeous, kind of looks like a T-rex with some imagination. Make sure you get here early because you don’t wanna be stuck climbing due to all the other tourist taking countless selfies. Don’t stop halfway down, continue on to the harder part and get down to the beach. I advies you to wear shoes cause the climb is kind of steap but really worth it"
Jennifer SF,"San Francisco, CA",Jun 2018,"Long scooter ride there, but definitely worth the trek. If you are taking a scooter there alone, be sure to get back on the road before sunset because the roads are narrow, curvy, sandy in parts, with many potholes - be extremely cautious! Lots of cool spots to take snaps and the extra 20idr to go up the lookout pts are totally worth it and helps the local community. Highly advise spending a whole afternoon here so you can make your way up and down to the secluded beach at the bottom - absolutely magnificent!! "
tbrunt,"Allen, TX",May 2018,Worth going to but got busy with the tourists even during shoulder season! Obviously attracting more folks now with the Instagram fame of the shoreline. Some folks were hiking down to the beach but the sea was too rough to get into once down there. 
Mariel D,"Macau, China",Jun 2018,"I’m just going to tell you this: THE WAY TO GET ANYWHERE IN NUSA PENIDA IS HELL! I’m not talking about the views or the beach, i’m talking about the road to get there. It’s really BAD. So yes the place is amazing but the most of the time you are in your car or your moto to get any of the places in the island (at least 45 min to get from one point to another) so when you arrived you will probably feel pretty bad. I went yesterday with my husband and my 2 year old daughter and we are all in pain...my neck, my arms even 1 foot is hurt because all the horrible movements in the car because of the rocks in the way. "
Giacomo,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",May 2018,This place is  must go in Nusa Penida. Such amazing drone shots and scenic photos can be taken there. The only problem is the amount of people who all want to take the same picture. There are little places to have something to eat and drink and for the more adventurous you can follow the steep steps that take you to the main beach on the ground. I had vertigo so couldn’t do it but again.... wow! 
Marcusnyi,"Mandalay, Myanmar",Apr 2018,"It is not only good for a breath taking view but for an adventure.it can be said a kind of adventure.only if we are fit enough,we will get the full satisfaction offered by the place. Most people enjoy having their photos taken as there is no place like this we can get our bestie"
m_baxby,7 contributions,Jun 2018,"This is one place where photos don’t do the place justice. The view from the top is incredible. The climb down to the beach was tougher than expected (probably tougher going down than coming back up, as you can use the fencing to pull yourself up the steps). The beach has the most perfect soft white sand, and the waves are breathtaking - not safe for swimming, but great to watch! An amazing place."
Travel4Life1112,51 contributions,May 2018,"This is a must see in Nusa Penida. I think it is worth the trip just to see this.I did the stairs down to the bottom to the beach, its quite a trek. You really need to wear shoes and be in good shape and not scared of heights. It takes about 45 minutes down and a bit longer up. It is supposed to be ""stairs"" but as you go further down it becomes more like climbing. I strongly recommend making the climb super worth it once you get to the bottom. It is very hot and you are in the beating open sun so drink water and maybe and hat or sunscreen."
Luke B,12 contributions,May 2018,One of the most amazing coastlines you can witness. The views are amazing as far as the eyses can see. The colours of the water and the sands against the towering cliff faces is breathtaking. One of the many spectacular views on the paradise Island. Careful of the photo snapping tourists near the cliffs edge. Can get very busy.
ymLee1991,Malaysia,May 2018,It's a long way down climbing to the bottom to reach the beach. Stairs made of rocky woods and stones. Blue ocean and white sandy beach. Definitely worth the 30mins climb down and probably an hour to climb up. Preferably to reach around 4-5pm when it isn't so hot and can enjoy the sunset
alam n,4 contributions,Dec 2017,"Just like a pinkie promise, the land does also appear to take the form of a Kelingking or pinkie finger. However, it is the comparison to the T-Rex that has caused this location to become so popular."
Inez S,7 contributions,May 2018,such a wonderful beauty from above. i was scared to go down at first because it looked really hard. it was pretty steep but i kept goingjust one step at a time. but because it's really steep it is also really fast to get down/up. the beach was worth it. also i recommend going up when the sun is not too hot so you're not as tired.
coolsabharwals,"Mumbai, India",May 2018,extremely bad road... just do kellingking beach on nusa penida and nothing else.. bad infrastructure
Beauy,"Two Rocks, Australia",May 2018,"The beach here is immaculate ! One of the best swims in Bali , there is a decent walk trail down to the beach where the water is fresh and the white sand is awesome , a must see at Penida 👌"
Brian L,"Gothenburg, Sweden",Apr 2018,"This place cant be described in words. The view is simply stunning and out of this world. If youre fit for the long walk down to the beach I strongly recommend, but be carefull of the strong waves. Not the best roads and a quite a bumpy ride. "
Sebastian S,"Mexico City, Mexico",May 2018,"The beach has a great view from the top but there is a lot of people and, for me, you won't be able to appreciate all the beauty that kelingking has to offer. If you want, and can, you can go down the beach and relax for 1 or 2 hours. It is important to mention that the path is really steep and you have to wear sneakers. I would say that it is no suitable for kids. Once you are in the beach, you can enjoy a privileged view with only a couple of people. "
Revol S,11 contributions,Feb 2018,This was the place I was looking forward since the beginning of the trip. I was amazed by the view this place had to offer. The trek down to the beach was amazing as it had rained just before we reached here so the path as wet and slippery making it more interesting  the water is as blue as it could be and the sand so fine. One of the spot you should miss if you visit NusaPenida island. 
vish 2 travel,"New Delhi, India",Mar 2018,"If you happen to plan Bali , then don't miss to include this place in your itinerary .Hands down , it's going to be the best highlight of your Bali trip , it's actually misspelt .It should have been the 'Killing beach' 😀We did it along with billabong & broken bridge , and what a delight it was to do all 3 together .Plan a little before you go . the views are pure and ptistine to say the least but the unbelievable part us at the beach , which will take 30+mins of trekking down .The trek is slightly primitive, to say the least (Google before you make up your mind ) . I saw atleast 2 dozen of people doing it   .You may like to view the splendour of the place from the tip of the cliff itself, no sweats if you can't go down . Connectivity to the place  is poor , if you want to be kind and day that it's non-existing .The way the cliff is arched out it is so very selfie friendly , and there are eating spots, which are just fine and serve some best fresh juice and bananas , you can manage to have here .However , you cannot and should not to this place with kids under 8.Happy Bali to you !"
AliMahisefat,"Tehran, Iran",May 2018,"You must see! It’s  sooo dreamy!!clear ocean with magnatic colors! Unbelievable! There were 3 beaches in our tour which were all so beautiful. But among all, Kelingking is the best! For the next time, I will definitely choose Kelingking to stay the whole day. Because of islans’s gravel roads, you will be moved to left and right strongly which might makes you sick and vomiting. Make sure to bring a big beach towel and beach tent because the chairs and tents get occupied quickly. Also water shoes are so useful since there are so many shells on coast."
Miekekarregat,"Volendam, The Netherlands",May 2018,"Gotta love love love this view. Very much worth the bumpy ride (when your not a hero on a scooter, hire a car with driver). Don’t expect to be here by yourself but enough space to make good pics.Few people climb down to the beach so for pics without other people in it just go a couple of meters down. The way to the beach is a challenge, expect more than half an hour walking very steep and sometimes challenging paths. Bring enough water!There are several warungs at the place so a combination with lunch is possible. "
Jesper C,"Kempten, Germany",May 2018,"We went down the steps to the beach, it’s a steep way were your climbing a bit, I was wearing thongs, I wouldn’t recommend that at all.The way down takes about 45-60 min. It’s worth it wenn you get to the beach.We went for a swim at the beach, but it’s not for everyone, really strong current and big waves.Really a shame that people throw there plastic bottles on the track just because there aren’t a rubbish bin. We collected minimum 20 water bottles and toke them to the bin at the top."
Stefano Bz,"Bressanone, Italy",May 2018,"If you are in Nusa Penida you have to go and see this amazing place. It is even better as the thousand pictures that you can see! We didn’t walk down to the beach as we planed to see Billabong and Brocken beach after and did not have enough time, but it has to be beautiful down there!! "
didisand,"Sofia, Bulgaria",May 2018,"If you come to Nusa Penida you cannot skip Kelinking beach since it is one of the biggest sightseeings on the island. The road has parts that were okay but some of them were very bumpy, with a lot of holes in them and the last 10 minutes are all sand and stones with holes. My boyfriend and I were traveling with a rented motorcycle and this was the 5th day of us driving (never had before) and we managed just fine but keep in mind that it is nit easy at all. You can hire a local driver but the experience is not the same at all. The view point on the cliff is overcrowded with a lot of tourists. You wait in line to make photos. The views are breathtaking though, you have to see them live (just what you would put as a desktop wallpaper)! If you are hungry, you can visit one of the warungs (local restaurants) there. The parking fee is 5 000 Rp/motorbike. There is a steep path down the beach but if you plan to go there go as early as you can since the road is long and the path to the beach is hard and with no shadow. Don’t recommend to watch the sunset here - the road as I said is in very bad condition and dangerous in the day not to say at night."
Smad2306,"Newport, UK",May 2018,"Beautiful beach, and views especially sunset, there is a hike down to the beach but be careful it's quite dangerous. Not for little ones"
Cameron M,"Mobile, AL",Apr 2018,"Overall, it is a pain in the butt for a modest pay-off. The infrastructure on Nusa Penida is over-run with tourists. 8 of 10 vehicles that are beating the roads into a bombed-out wasteland are tourist vans, vying to keep two wheels on the pavement and hopefully two wheels on the shoulder. The convoy often comes to a stop and even backs up to create a little room for an oncoming convoy of tourist vans. Much of the road to Kelingking Broken is completely destroyed by tourist van traffic, leaving the locals in a horrible position. The vies is spectacular, but it's barely worth the nausea-inducing kidney-battering ride to get there. The scenery along the way is only a modest consolation for the tough ride because there’s so much garbage. Garbage EVERYWHERE. The token trash bins overflow and the wind scatters what little rubbish that folks bother to try to dispose of. The rainy season had passed, so at least the trash you see in the ravines will stay put until the end of the year."
asdarunasd,"Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India",May 2018,"This place has recently been scrolling in social media and yes it is worth the visit just for the view. Its located in nusa penida which is 40 min boat ride from the main coast of bali. Nusa penida is a small island with very small roads and i would recommend to book with a tour guide if you dont know much about the place. If you are an adventure seeker you can rent out a motorbike and explore the island urself. One of the best view is the view from top of Kelingking beach, you can also hike down the cliff where you can experience the white sandy beach ( hiking up will be hardwork). Over all worth a visit"
jennyKincumber,kincumber,Apr 2018,It is a beautiful view from the top. But it is a long way down to the beach. The path is steep and dangerous so didn't do it.
lemsu,"Istanbul, Turkey",May 2018,"We went to Nusa Penida island by ferry approximately in  1 hour, when we reached the island tour guide pick up us and we went kelingking beach in 45 minutes ,the roads are so bad but when you see the perfect view you can forget all suffers. We liked this place very much. If you come to Bali you should visit this place one time in your life "
tuyet n,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Apr 2018,Beautiful Keling Beach. Should go down the the stair if you have time. This is lunch stop for most of the tour.
nFatrin,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"it was really beautiful here. The view from the TOP is amazing !!!!To go down there is crazy path but possible. It was really amazing experienceTiring, hot but fun !! Such a workout in the middle of hot day. Beach down there is clean and beautiful.I admire so much those local ladies who go down there to sell drink. Unbelieveable. They made it like it's an easy thing to do. If u re adventurous enough go for it. "
Elia S,11 contributions,Apr 2018,"Spectacular view, creamy sandy beach and turqoise water. Trip to go there is preferred in early morning the road partly challenging.nice place for instagram pics."
Violeta Z,"Monterrey, Mexico",Apr 2018,"From the port you can rent a motorbike for 70 rupias and bike to all the attractions in the island. I did not how to use a scooter, this day I learned. It was super fun saves a lot of money. The road has a lot of holes but if you drive cautiously you will get there. A lot of different photospots "
emmy91,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,We took a half day tour across the island in Nusa Penida to visit these places and this was the last stop.. If you’re lucky you get to spot dolphins too! 
Warung NG,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Apr 2018,Wanna be here all the times. Amazing view and the atmosphere here just truly fantastic. The beach also clean.
Roy,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"Very nice place, the beach, clift and its wave make me think about going there again. Easy to find drink and food there, since there are many stall around❤️"
Ranjit Laxman,"Thalassery, India",Apr 2018,Many people had visited Bali earlier with whom I checked before going to Bali. But none of them mentioned anything about this place. Nusa Penida is an island just 45 mins by a speed boat from Sanur harbour. If you book through an agent they will arrange everything and there is a driver at the island waiting for you by the time the boat reaches the island. Kelingking Beach is an hours drive and the crowd is just catching up now. This breathtaking view is unexplainable. One has to experience it as when you stand at that cliff which is a bit dangerous as there is no safety rails except a bamboo fencing that too not very safe. carry your camera always when you go to such places and there are lots of photo ops. There is a way you can climb down but again too risky and dangerous.
rseanh,"Cardiff, UK",Apr 2018,"Most beautiful sight I have ever set my eyes on, it’s a must do! Walking down to the beach on the other hand is a massive job, so tiring and physical! You have to watch every step, take plenty of food and water! The beach itself is great, but waves are unbelievable strong so be careful. "
Rios-Little,"Dakar, Senegal",Mar 2018,This is a must place to visit if you are in Nusa Penida. The view is spectacular. We all kids and adults enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend you add to your list. We went in the middle of the day and so it was terribly hot. It's probably better to go for sunrise or sunset. 
Ilaria C,"London, UK",Apr 2018,this place is absolutely amazing! there are sone dangerous stairs which bring you down to the beach but the view is great even from the top of the hill. they suggest you not go downstairs but people told me that it’s a great experience. We couldn’t go because it was late and it was getting dark. Sunset is spectacular from there. The road to get there is a disaster so be careful and take your time. It’s worth to go though! 
rishi b,122 contributions,Apr 2018,"To reach the top of the hill from where you can see the Kelingking beach, you have to rent a scooter and ride 14 kms / 30-45 mins. The view from top is completely worth the effort. Also, while you are at Nusa Penida, you should check out Billabong Beach."
SteMar247,"Maidstone, UK",Apr 2018,"This island has many impressive views and this is one of them. I would have loved to have had time to go down to the beach and explore, but our itinerary wouldn't allow that. "
rohit p,"Chandigarh, India",Dec 2017,"The view from is top is just spectecular, although you have to walk down to go to the beach which should take around half and hour and it's not very safe either as the board reads ""go down at your own risk"" as the path down the hill was a bit broken when we went there"
Nicolai B,"Altdorf bei Nurnberg, Germany",Apr 2018,What a view!! It is amazing. If you want you can go done stairs. It takes maybe 40 minutes to go done and spend some time at this nice white sand beach. I will come back!! Must have seen at Nusa Penida 
luxurybackpacking,"London, UK",Mar 2018,Honestly pictures of Kelingking Beach do not do it justice! No matter how many times you visit it still is incredible! Make sure to head there in the afternoon when crowds are a lot quieter and much  of the tour groups have gone.
TheLittleTraveller,"Chania Town, Greece",Apr 2018,Don't leave the island without see that beautiful beach.Its really dangerous to get down there and some parts are like climbing but if u stay up without go down is beautiful again!! U can go after the angel beach it's 20 min from there .the road is pretty bad and if you don't know how to drive good a scooter then find a driver to drive you there with a car.when you return there is a shortcut road 40' that is good .If you want to go only to that beach you have to drive from that road 
Mario B,48 contributions,Apr 2018,From the top (starting point) is probably best view point on island! There are lot of small cottages with food & drinks at the top so you can buy what you need. Bring enought water because climbing down & up cam be heawy for unprepared persons. Recomend snickers and not fliplops (despite you can see lot turists walking with them:). At the bottom one of the beast beaches I ever saw! Don't swim far - dangerous waves! Don't missed this place when you are in Nusa Penida!
Traveller123,"London, UK",Feb 2018,"My self and a friend traveled to this spot by motorbike which we rented at the port for around $5 AUD. The roads are in terrible conditions at some points so I wouldn't recommend going this way unless you experienced riding. We reached Kelingking took a couple photos and without hesitation made our way down towards the beach. Let's just say going down was the easy part, The mountain is extremely steep with only some bamboo tied together with some rope to 'stop' you from falling off the edge. It is also extremely hot so take a lot of water, but don't pack too much as the climb back up the mountain can become extremely difficult if you have a lot to carry. Once you do get down to the bottom you can not enter the water, as it is dangerously rough, the waves are huge and crash right on the shore with that much power that even standing meters away you are almost swept off your feet. We were also lucky enough to be able to purchase some water and beers down the bottom as well. We made the silly mistake of drinking a beer before the climb back up which we both regretted as the climb is so hard and with a beer in your belly you do not feel good. The climb back up was exhausting, and we almost passed out from the heat a couple of times because there is absolutely no relief from the sun and we started the climb back up at 12:30 - 1:00 pm. I wouldn't say I am unfit but we both really struggled. We timed the climb up and it took us about 30 mins - although it felt a lot longer!All in all - its an experience like none other! Would I do it again HELL NO. But I would tell anyone who is up for it to give it a go! My body ached for the next 3 days."
A Raz,"Birmingham, UK",Apr 2018,"I've been to Bali numerous times and visited many of its beaches but Kelingking Beach is particularly outstanding. The view from the cliff is just amazing and (if you're fit enough to descend to the beach and climb back up) the beach itself is very rewarding. Yes! It's quite an effort to go down to the beach, but that what makes it worth the effort. The sand, the wave, everything is so perfect.If you wanna go down to the beach, my recommendation is to go there early in the morning. Travel light. Going down to the beach is quite dangerous.. use practical and comfortable sandals. While down there.. just enjoy the beach for a couple of hours.. You could also bring bento to have lunch down there. After you gain back your energy then climb back up. Climbing back up is actually a lot easier than going down, but it takes more energy.This place is very recommended and I would defly go back there again!PS: It takes around 20-40 minutes to descend and 10-20 minutes to climb up, depending on your level of fitness."
Andresguia,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"The place is beautiful but to reach the white sandy beach below you must descend dangerous steps. The typical photo here is sitting on the edge of the cliff, be careful! There is a tree called the tree of love nearby where people used to make photos too."
Wei92,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,"The view here is very beautiful and nice. My girlfriend and I enjoyed ourselves very much, especially with the stunning view. Will definitely recommend anyone visiting Bali to pay a visit to Nusa Penida and Kelingking Beach"
Denisa S,"Prague, Czech Republic",Apr 2018,"Definitely the must see of Nusa Penida...Very beautiful view.. Even it’s not easy to get down to the beach, offers a white sand and clear water. "
JubastiOnTour,"Munich, Germany",Apr 2018,"Kelingking beach is beautiful and offers an amazing view and is definitely the must-see of Nusa Penida. However, while the streets are better than many other streets on Nusa Penida, the place is still hard to reach by scooter and not recommended for beginners. The entrance was 5k per scooter. As in most cases, you have to share this beautiful place with lots of tourists, especially selfie-addicted instagrammers looking for the perfect picture (at least in the afternoon at around 3pm). Still, we would definitely visit this place again to enjoy the view!"
Stella Marie A,15 contributions,Mar 2018,"The view is really awesome! It could be seen from above that the beach is crystal and inviting. However, at past half a century old, going to the beach and trekking for about an hour (and a half) will literally take my breath away.Going around the island of Nusa Penida requires a good pair of comfortable shoes, preferably hiking ones.  The rolling hills however small would not make comfortable trekking in slippers.  Food was available although the choices were not varied.  Remember to hydrate yourself, sun could be harsh up there on the hills. Also, apply and re-apply sunblock."
janiblank,"Aachen, Germany",Mar 2018,"The view and the nature at Kelinging are absolutely amazing but the place is pretty crowded and everyone tries to take the best photos, selfies and drone shots which is pretty annoying.."
KHigson,"Leyland, UK",Dec 2017,"Arrived here via moped on the horrendous roads but worth every massive bump along the way. Spectacular views the rock formation, which looks like a dinosaurs head. The sea is clear blue, with white sands. There are various spots you can view it from and have your photo taken. On a personal note I suffer badly from a fear of heights so unlike most wasn't keen on getting too close to the edge due to the very steep drop. There are 'steps' made from bamboo and tree roots that lead down the steep ascent to the beach but there is a sign suggesting it is dangerous so not to go down. I certainly wouldn't attempt this in flipflops or if like me you have a fear of heights. I tried to go a short way down (after some encouragement) for a photo but couldn't make it as I was too worked up but many others found it fine to reach the photo point. I only saw 1-2 people who went all the way down to the beach. It looks amazing but not for the faint hearted by any means.There are a few shops and restaurants around at teh top which are nice to sit in and enjoy the view. Stunning location, a definate for instergrammers, but just have your wits about you."
ilikemanggis,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2018,"One of my bucket list was done and checked after visited this beautiful beach. White sands mix with deep blue and turquoise water definitely a perfect combination. When you visit Nusa Penida, please don't forget to visit this beautiful spot!"
PearlySim,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"A lovely seascape and awesomely breathtaking place to take photos to post onto your instagram.  If not on a guided tour, try taking the very steep stairs down to the beach (at your own risk)."
Adham411,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2018,make sure you have enough time to go down and up againswimming there is something you don't want to miss
Brian L,"Chandler, AZ",Mar 2018,"Kelingking Beach looks great in pictures and that is what brings people to see it.HOWEVER!You have to take a ferry from Sanur to Nusa Penida.  Then from the pier you need to take a 1 hour car ride over some of the worst roads imaginable.Once you arrive, you want to start taking pictures but to get really great pictures you MUST take the trail.  The trail has rocky, slippery, steps, broken bamboo for hand rails, and it is extremely steep.  There are about 7 - 8 warning signs stating you are on your own.I stopped half way to take my pictures while my friend went all the way down to the beach.  She mentioned it is very treacherous getting to the beach as the steps are now in the mountainside.Keep in mind this is just going down and now you have to return the same way back up.If you really want to do this be in great shape and don’t plan anything the following day as you will be sore. "
karinkaspar,24 contributions,Mar 2018,"Very popular place in Nusa Penida, so thing about timing. We went there early in the morning (around seven), so we’ve been there almost alone, just us and another couple.At the beginning you see a sign: “Do not go down on the beach. Road is broken.” Well, we went there anyway, is quite easy, if you have not a flipflop shoes. You have to be careful, of course, but then... it is just amazing. Big waves, so do not sedím far away, strong klima. And thing about timing for a way back as well; we’ve been there quite a long time, so on the road back was quite busy climbing and more important - with very strong sun. Early in the morning it us the best, not just because of you are alone there, but also because of more comfortable way back without strong sun. "
Venkat,Singapore,Mar 2018,"The view from the top of the mountain was breathtaking, it’s dangerous to go down to the beach, the path to beach was not maintained."
Mandy K,30 contributions,Mar 2018,"Terrible roads to get there but the views are absolutely amazing. Worth the effort though. I climbed down to the beach. Don't try unless you are fit and strong. Very dangerous, slippery, steep and unstable bamboo rails but it was one of the best things I have ever done. When I went there were no waves so swimming was beautiful in crystal clear blue water. Sand beautiful and white. Water, soft drink and Bintang available at the beach. Many tourists at the top viewpoint but only five on the beach. Manta rays were able to be seen from the top view points. Incredible place to visit. "
melanieamelia2,"Trier, Germany",Mar 2018,"The true landscape is awesome. Complete facilities from toilets to snack canteens. My suggestion to try to go down, it would be a wonderful experience on your journey, because not all who want to go down. A must visit this place."
Bradley C,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"A must visit point. However, there are two many tourists nowadays. Didn't get the chance to go down the beach but heard it's pretty nice(also tough to get down though) but would like to give it a try next time."
Uphiet K,"Pasuruan, Indonesia",May 2017,"Bumpy roads but worthy reward. I'm in love with this place, so beautiful. Hidden place and still not so crowded. If you go to Bali, go to Nusa Penida to get calmer and peaceful place like this one"
luislellis,"Rio de Janeiro, RJ",Mar 2018,"What a view!!! This beach is so beautiful, the landscape is gorgeous. To reach the beach you have to go down from a stair. Kind of slippery but ok to go. Worth it."
Voguely Vivien,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Oct 2017,"Worth the (rather rocky) journey to Kelingking Beach. Apparently it will take years before they can upgrade the gravel roads to tar ones. While it is possible to rent mopeds to get around simply anywhere in Nusa Penida, personally I won't recommend them! I've seen tourists trying to manoeuvre their way along these uneven roads and it is cringe-worthy. I suggest either renting vehicles with driver (500k+ for one day) or ojek aka moped riders (70k for one day) to show you around. I did both and the latter was quite an experience! Can't feel my thighs after the 1 hour ride along bumpy, gravel roads to Atuh Beach hahaha"
Jason E,165 contributions,Feb 2018,"It’s one of the most beautiful vista in the Bali and the Nusa islands but 99% of you will only look at it from up top of the cliff.  It takes a long time to get there and the path down was congested and full of other tourists.   With that being said, it makes for some of the best highlights when we show people our trip.  In a nut shell, it’s beyond beautiful but it didn’t make me emotionally attached to an experience there. "
Rafaella Pessoa,"Sao Paulo, SP",Feb 2018,The view from the top is just amazing. You can do a trail to access the beach. That trial is quite hard and takes around one hour. You can do it on flip flops but it might be way easier on tennis. The beach is not the best for swimming as there are many waves but the views along the way and the blue water compensate the effort to get there!
Izani A,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"It's worth to come and enjoy the view here. but if you manage to be here by grouping, 4 pax is just nice for 7 seaters car, so just rent a car with driver rather than ride motorcycle, since the 8KM road from jetty to the kelingking's beach is not well maintained."
Rohliana L,19 contributions,Feb 2018,"Nusa Penida should be on your list when you are traveling to bali, if this is your first time and you are traveling alone better book a group tour the price is worth it. They offer many package. You can choose with snorkeling package or just to see the west of nusa penida such a kelingking beach broken beach and angel billabong."
RaghavAhuja,"Bengaluru, India",Mar 2018,One of the best places on our Bali trip was this. This has an amazing view of the beach down below. Try going down if it’s possible. It’s a must see place
Feinspitz,"Vienna, Austria",Mar 2018,So the view really is amazing. It is definitely worth renting a scooter (around 3$ a day) and driving there. The road is not always perfect but the way is managable even for more unexperienced drivers (like my self; 2nd time ever on a scooter)The Beach? Totally different story. The way down is difficult (some may say quite dangerous) the way up is straight up a full workout. I have never been sweatier before I think. What you get when you do this to yourself is a dirty beach tons of jellyfish on the Beach and in the water and local People trying to sell you snacks and water which you will eventually actualy need.I would Not recommend you to Go down when your are Not in a good shape or if you expect the beach of your dreams.
MasMarjana,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,"I have been in so many place in Bali, and in my opinion this is the best spot. The view from the top was simply breathtaking. But I didn’t want to walk down due to safety consideration and time consume. People called Kelingking Beach it’s mean Little Finger or Pinkie Beach. But in my opinion the cliffs isn’t like little finger but look like Tyrannosaurus Rex.Kelingking Beach was a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island.The road to reach this place was unfavourable. Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most"
Amy T,"Brooklyn, NY",Mar 2018,"I had been wanting to visit Nusa Penida after seeing the beautiful pictures everywhere and realizing it was just 30 minutes from Bali where I was going on vacation this past week. The reviews are accurate - this isn't an easy place to get to, and the climb is not easy either - but the view is worth it. I have never seen a place like this in my life and it IS breathtaking. We booked a tour which included a fast boat from Sanur beach to Nusa Penida and then a driver picked us up and drove us there. We could have rented motorbikes or just a taxi, but we weren't sure and were limited on time so we just got a tour guide. The fast boat was about 45 minutes, and once we arrived our tour guide immediately picked us up and started driving up Nusa Penida to the beach, which was about a 45 minute drive through long, winding, and needless to say bumpy roads. Once we arrived the views were incredible and it wasn't too touristy which was great. We decided to start the trek down, and about halfway we stopped to turn back around. To be completely honest, my legs still hurt 3 days later from the hike (and I didn't even go all the way). The hike down is not paved and has rocks and some wood to help guide you, but it's definitely scary and treacherous. I do regret not going all the way down, so if you have time - I would recommend trying it if you are fit and in shape. For me, it was about 90 degrees and I was absolutely exhausted, so I was scared about going all the way down and turned around even though I wish I hadn't. I would visit this place as a once in a lifetime experience if you are in Bali. "
Sari I,16 contributions,Feb 2018,"It’s the most beautiful nature I’ve seen so far in Bali , it’s hard to get too the place , but totally worth it ! "
RuddyDusk,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2018,This is the 3rd time i went down to the beach and it always worth it every drop of my sweat. Amazing view.
Cha,Philippines,Dec 2017,"Simply wow! I wish I could swim in those cool, blue waters. Fresh wind and white sand. I absolutely loved it!"
Ingrid F,7 contributions,Feb 2018,Wow this beach was incredible but the hike back up was mental! Worth it once in a lifetime but not sure I'd do it again!
Abie,"Queensland, Australia",Sep 2017,The most beautiful spot in Nusa Penida i reckon. So majestic and breathtaking to view! Getting a photo taken at the spot without the fence here though looks a bit dangerous and is a bit of a joke as you had to fall in line as if going to the toilet. The path down the ravine to the beach was closed when we went there and did not look at all safe but a fair few were willing to risk it for instagram. HahaThe place was a bit of a drive but relatively easy to get to with a map and a few directions from locals. Going back was confusing on a motorbike.We got to sample the local mie goreng as well which was surpringly offered at a very affordable price compared to the rest of the tourist spots and Bali. Lovely experience. Will definitely go back!
Ayush Krishnan C,19 contributions,Dec 2017,"This - in my opinion - is the epitome of beauty in Bali. The view is absolutely stunning. Although we didn't have time, I would have liked to trek all the way down to the bottom beach. If you do, I would highly recommend. This is a must visit in Bali - add it straight away to your itinerary."
Aashish T,3 contributions,Jan 2018,Blue water and golden sands - that summarizes it all. Such a calm and beautiful place! Thanks to #BaliCheapestTour for making my trip hasslefree and simple.
Konstantinus_Bayu,20 contributions,Jan 2018,"Kelingking beach is one of the must visit spot when you are at Nusa Penida. Located at the south side of the island, it will take around 1,5 hours from the Toya Pakeh harbor due to damaged road conditions in some areas to the location.But all the suffering on the journey will be paid once you arrive at the Kelingking Beach. Emerald colored ocean, white sandy beach and cool breeze will welcome you there."
Nina N,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Feb 2018,"We did not realise how strenuous the hike down to the beach is, the way down is quite tough going with just bamboo tied together on either side to stop you from falling, I was still a bit sick with the flu at the time and only made it down to the halfway point before becoming dizzy. The climb up was even more hard going and we passed a couple of people on the way up taking a break and dying of thirst that asked us for some water, I would definitely recommend not going in the afternoon, we went at about 3pm and the sun beats down on the walk with no escape from it which made it hard going and I became extremely sunburnt from the hike. I definitely want to come back and try the hike again with a bit more preparation next time."
Ika C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,I wasn’t aware that the road was really bad on the west side of Nusa Penida island. Our car was shaken hard to reach Kelingking beach. Using motor cycle was not recommended . 
Irwan2003,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,Great view.... But to reach the beach you must down with the very long stairs... But it's worthed... You will found the great beach with great sand
thb68boy,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"When we arrived on this beach, I feel so amazing that we have some kind of beach like this. One of the things from the myth there is that they have a love tree and while you climb and sit there, your love wish will come true, although I don't believe it but some friends climbed and took a photo too hehe. Too bad that we cannot swim on this beautiful beach because of the high tide, but still you can enjoy the beach."
Prathamesh Sawant,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2018,"The view is simply breathtaking. This place was never a part of my itinerary, but I met a Malaysian dude during white water rafting and he showed me some of the pics from the island. Then and there I decided i'll visit this place.The T-Rex shaped mountain, blue azure waters everything is just simply amazing. If one is willing to hike a little they can even go down to the sandy beach at this place. However, since we were on a tight schedule we did not go all the way down. Also just 100-200 meters from this place there is another viewpoint which gives you a very different perspective of this place. From that place, the entire mountain feels like an elephant with his trunk and the mountain besides seems like a crocodile."
Tom A,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Jan 2018,I lost few times before reach to this beach. Worth few hours bike riding and the view was breathtakingly beautiful! Next time will plan properly to visit and spend a night in the island is a must!
sharealkoh,6 contributions,Jan 2018,This was our last stop and we had to catch the 330pm ferry and it was already 240pm! The drive back was about 40mins. The drive was really bumpy but it's totally worth it! Next trip we're definitely staying and making it down to the beach! 
Devansh A,"Hyderabad, India",Feb 2018,My main tip is I you have time spend a few hours here cause you can hike down to the beach and chill. So better get good shoes and a carry on with swim wear and stuff i saw many broken slippers down and it would be a painful hike up.  It should take atleast an hour to reach down to the beach and the climb up is tough but totally worth it. We only regret not having much time to enjoy this place we ran down and up again. 
Tanni Williams,Hoedspruit,Jan 2018,"A must visit whilst on this island! Just be weary of the steps leading down to the beach, but what you will find is absolutely worth it... wouldn’t recommend doing it in flip flops.."
Kopal G,"Mumbai, India",Jan 2018,"The view from the top is amazing, but the climb down the cliff is worth every bit once you see the bluest waters there can be. The last section of the climb is almost vertical and it's better to remove slippers of you're wearing them to have better footing. The sea waves are strong. We did a somersault in the water when we were hit by two back to back waves. Every sand grain is white. And the water is the perfect turquoise blue!! Remember to carry some water down for the climb back up. Also remember to climb down light, without any bag.The climb back up requires one to pull them self up with all four limbs. The beach is virgin. They have made a path to teach the beach using wooden sticks, logs and stones. In places it does get tricky. But it's doable!Would definitely recommend this awesome experience to those who are looking for adventure, fun and excitement! P.s. not for those with a fear of heights."
SaurovNandy,"Bengaluru, India",Jul 2017,Kelingking beach is one of the most stunning sights that I have ever seen.We reached there by noon and luckily there were not many tourists.If you have the time then do walk down to the beach from Karang dawa view point. The steps are uneven and the climb can be a bit treacherous but surely you won't regret it.At least climb down till the half way point for your best photo op.
Gabcared,"Suzhou, China",Jan 2018,"Very nice views, beautiful beach. Quite hard to get there, especially in rainy season, but even if you don't go down it worth it."
MorwennaJones,"Cambridge, UK",Jan 2018,"We visited Kelingking in January, the off season and most quiet time of year for tourism, expecting to get there and find it largely empty.  After negotiating the treacherous roads by scooter (and I mean treacherous- we witnessed a bad accident only the day after), we arrived to find about 30/40 other tourists there, which is a lot given the limited amount of cliff space.  Lots had arrived in the people-carriers from resorts, which make it easy to navigate the dangerous roads and get to all of the places on the island that, otherwise, are hard to reach.  The beach is utterly stunning and completely beautiful, but be prepared to find it crowded, especially if you visit in the off-season.  There's also a very dangerous ledge that tourists were dangling off for photos!  Also, when we visited, there was a sign next to the path down to the beach warning against going down.  We ummed and ahhed about whether to risk it, but fortunately chose not to, and after doing another walk down the cliffs, I'm so glad we chose not to!  The cliff trails here are very steep, dangerous and frequently involve putting your whole body weight on bamboo strapped to the cliff, so for god's sake, if there's a sign there saying that the path is broken, don't ignore it!"
Nusa Penida Exploration,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Kelingking beach is top tourist destination in Nusa Penida island. It's a hidden Paradise in the island. It's a famous place to do the activity of the tracking and also well-known as a place to enjoy the wonderful sunset.
niranjan a,12 contributions,Jan 2018,I can only say is this place is a mush visit place. The view is breath taking.You need to book a tour to nusa penida to see this place. Once ur in bali go for some local tour to visit this place.Must visit i would say.
Bagus Perbawa,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Had an amazing visit at Kelingking beach. The weather was pretty hot and the view was quite breathtaking, the waves looks great from above and the turquoise water was visible. Unfortunately I did not wear proper shoes and my slippers was unfit for trrekking down to the beach.Other travellers said the swell was around 1-2 meters high and was not that hard to swim. The secluded beach would have been a perfect spot to just relax, sunbake and dipping but do bring some water when you go down, its quite a hike back up.Additional advice - take some photos at the wooden bamboo boat on top of the hill (it's a bit worn out - be careful) or take some amazing shot in the lonely tree. Food and drinks are quite reasonable, bought Nasi Goreng for 30K and coke (can) for 15K."
756rickyl,"Bandung, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Nusa Penida an island off the southeast coast of Bali. Not many people know about this surprisingly beautiful island that contain so many beautiful, natural spots. Recently, more and more people are starting to discover and explore this wonderful island. There are about a dozen separate locations/spots within the island such as: Angel's Billabong, Pantai Atuh, Crystal Bay, etc, etc ... with the most famous one, arguably, is Pantai Kelingking (Kelingking Beach). Well, for people who have social media and love to post pictures on the net, this island is the definitely the one for you."
leberl,"Denver, CO",Jan 2018,"The view from the top is absolutely incredible! There is a 5,000 IDR entrance fee. You can hike down to the bottom and get to the beach. Be aware the hike is very sketchy in places. You hike along the rim with massive drop offs to either side of you. There are some bamboo fences but they aren't very steady. Wear proper hiking shoes (no flip flops or sandals). I do not recommend going by yourself. The hike down took me about 30 minutes but I hike on a regular basis. If you are able to brave the hike down, you'll be rewarded with an empty or near-empty beach! Keep an eye on the tide and weather as you do not want to get stuck down at the bottom."
Albi A,3 contributions,Oct 2017,"We can say is that this place is magnificent,the sceneries from the top is really spectacular.And hike down to the beach,you can spend a day sunbathing and relaxing in one of the most beautiful and remote beaches I've ever come across."
Ramona N,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Oct 2017,"This Instagram famous coastal cliffscape will not disappoint. This is definetely one of those landscapes that make you feel so small! When we reached there we forgot about the awful roads leading here. At times we were just driving over small rocks! Me and my husband took a short trek down but didn’t venture onto the beach. The path looked a little bit rough and after our crazy drive, we were to tired to do it. I mean reaching the beach I could do that, but then  hike back up: No, thank you!"
Locomotive Hotel & Spa,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"Wooow..!!! no words can described how amazing this place.. the most favorite tourists destination with breathtaking view in this island.. Travelled with friends from Netherland / Suriname and they were soo extremely very excited to see this kind of view..It’s looks like a dinosaur, they said. Hmm no no.. i said, for me it’s more looks like the finger of GOD that pointing to Paradise Bali Island 😍🙏🏻"
Going here and there,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"All i can say is that this place is magnificent, the view from the top is to die for. We did manage to descend to the beach from the very very steep stairs, took us around 50 minutes down and 1 hour up. The beach at the bottom is the best beach ever in Bali i would say, the high wave, the blue water and the cliff surrounding will make you forget about the steepest stairs.. definitely recommended to walk down those stair, however if you’re not very well i wouldn’t recommend you to go down. :)"
JackRush,"Sheffield, UK",Jan 2018,"A great place to go to view a slice of paradise. If you are able to take the hike down to the beach, you can spend a day sunbathing and relaxing in one of the most beautiful and remote beaches I’ve ever come across.It is possible to stand at the top of the cliff and look down at the beach, or you can scale the cliff yourself to get to it. We are 2 fairly fit 28 year olds and it took us about 25-30 mins to walk down and 20 mins to climb back up. Wear sensible shoes (I went in flip flops and decided it was easier in bare feet!) An absolute must see if you’re on the island "
Jason S,"Bengaluru, India",Jan 2018,This is the best place we visited in our tour of Nusa Penida - worth every moment we spent here. Though we didn't climb down but the pictures were amazing from top.
worldiscoverer,World,Dec 2017,A drive on bad roads lead to this lovely landscape where you have to jostle with people attempting to get the perfect instagram pictures. Some people trek down to the beach when it is clearly marked not to do so. We met and spoke to a few who really regretted going down and anyway its just another beach down there...we have been to enough around the world not to waste time and effort trekking up and down a risky path.Enjoy the view and don't miss the 'Pohon Cinta' - Love Tree.
beatrixbudhiadi,Bali,Jan 2018,Nusa Penida has so many amazing views making it hard to pick a favorite. But when the cliffs form in the shape of a Tyrannosaurus Rex at Kelingking Secret Point Beach it is bound to be a crowd favorite.Take the boat from SanurIDR75.000 For Local IDR150.000 For ForeignerYou can rent a motorbike at IDR100.000 per day or Hire a driver with car at IDR700.000 per day.You can visit three up to four objects if you want to have one day trip. Have local food to try approximately IDR200.000 for two persons depends on the restaurant and what kind of food you take.
JabbaQld,QLD,Jan 2018,"Attempted the descent, got 3/4 the way down and had a meltdown, so had to abort and ascend back up the mountain. Scary AF and would not recommend unless you are a mountain goat. "
Bel T,"Broome, Australia",Oct 2017,"Definitely worth a visit and also the roads to there are actually quite good and not as bumps as others. We did have a local follow us down to try and make a few dollars off us, but we just ignored him. "
OliverG591,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,One of the highlights of Nusa Penida for sure. The drive there is about 45 min but worth while. Views from top down to the pristine beach are fabulous. We did not make the way down as the treck is quiet adventures and not really safe for kids. That was the only downside...the beach is not really accessible for us. Many little Warungs around for drinks and basic food. 
fabiensf,"Island of Malta, Malta",Nov 2017,"I consider myself to be quite well travelled, and it takes a lot for a beach to impress me, yet i found this spot to be truly breathtaking!  I suggest walking around the cliff to get some different perspectives of the bay."
sthpacificlover,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"After reading the reviews im dumbfounded. Yes its a beautiful little beach - yeah i get that, but seriously there are thousands of better beaches in indonesia, that you dont have to ride for an hour on roads, where some parts are completely washed out then trek 400m down a dangerous cliff on a goat track that has disaster waiting to happen written all over it Ive lived and travelled indonesia for a few years now and was a little dissapointed in this one. Particularly with the large crowds, each paying the 5000rp to park.... the proceeds of which obviously dont go to road or track maintenance"
Novita s,"Sanur, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"View was amazing...weather is so good. Still nature and virgin. Love it.The road need so much repair. If you travel with kids, please becareful, pay a lot of attention to your kids."
Anastasya Gladys,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"Im 1000000% sure that NUSA PENIDA is more beautiful than Bali. This island is seriously AMAZING! Every corner of the island is providing u an indescribable view. The air is soooo much different than Bali, its like u get lost in some kind of jungle. I can tell u that this island is going to be the next Bali or even more."
riri273,Indonesia,Dec 2017,"Have no idea what to say when the first time I got here. And when our driver asked us to get down. I do not think that much, I said YES! I have to go down. Can't wait to touch that white-soft-sand. And when I started to went down, that's not as easy as I imagined. The fact is it's hard to get down. And I went down barefoot! since I use the unsuitable sandals. Better you go with sports shoes or mountain slippers. But that's all worth the view! that was so amazing beach I ever visit."
Meg0603,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2017,"Kelingking Beach is amazing. It has been on my bucket list to visit for a while now and the challenging hike down to the beach was well worth it.Most people stayed at the viewing platforms at the top or walked down about 500m to get the beautiful classic shot of the cliffs and water. If you are fit or even just love a challenge I would highly reccomend taking the walk down to the beach, it's an adventure in itself. There are parts of the walk where it is quite steep, almost like rock climbing but they have rocks and bamboo to grab on to and that only accounts for a small portion of the walk.It was a beautiful beach with clear waters. You can swim in the water there (we did) just make sure you know how to swim, there is a bit of a strong undertow and dumpy waves but you can time your entry and exit with the waves.Sadly there is a lot of rubbish that gets washed up on to the beach so if you are planning on making a trip down to the beach I recommend doing your bit and taking a bag of rubbish back up with you rather than just being frustrated with the site."
Grand_Dion,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2017,This is where he says he's like a dinosaur's head and I can finally come here. The beach is no less good with the places I've visited in Nusa Penida. If you want to get close to the rocks down the stairs are wooden but very dangerous if not careful. Strongly discouraged if not dare better just enjoy this beach from the top course.
Rizki Putra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,"If you have time to spend in Bali, please pay a visit to Nusa Penida. This island is just amazingly stunning. It has multiple beaches with jaw-dropping views, totally worth to visit. One of the great options is Kelingking Beach, or the locals used to call it as Karang Dewa. It is only 45 minutes from the Nusa Penida pier by a motorbike. You can easily rent a motorbike, or hire a cab there. Totally easy.The view was completely amazing, as you can see from many pictures here. However, do not go down to the beach if you are not feeling well. It was noon (around 1 am), when I decided to go down to the beach. Actually, the locals put a warning there to not go down because the track was very steep (yeah, 90-degree cliff) it was just like a wall-climbing without any safety rope, and without any safety guards. Going down is totally at your own risk. Also, consider the time to go down and back up. When I went down it was 1 pm and it was extremely hot and even my sunblock couldn’t prevent me from sunburn. The beach itself was actually very nice, and you can swim and enjoy the view for hours. Don’t forget to bring drinks and foods because there is no food stall down there. But please, I repeat, please bring back your trash up there. If you could, please also bring some other trash there. Unfortunately, there were so many trash on the beach. It was sad to find those trash in such paradise. Overall, the place is totally worth to visit. Take some pictures, enjoy the sun, smell the breeze, and drink some coconut. If you have enough energy and believe you can go down, please do so and enjoy paradise down there."
piksla,"Los Altos, CA",Dec 2017,"This place is spectacularly beautiful-- one of the prettiest I have ever seen.  They call it T.  Rex beach since it looks like a dinosaur.  The beach itself looks so inviting and tempts one to climb down to the beach.  Beware though- if you aren't in great shape, the hike is super tough.  Not only is the railing fragile and the slope steep, but there aren't ""steps"" most of the way-- just a path.  It is super hot on the path so make sure to wear a hat and bring plenty of water. I felt like I got heat stroke by not doing so.  Both the descent and ascent take a lot of time so budget accordingly."
Anna H,81 contributions,Oct 2017,"What a view! Stunning viewpoint looking down at the beach with the crashing waves and cliffs below. We didn't have time to go down to the beach itself- the track down doesn't look good for those with flip-flops only or a fear of heights! Absolute must-see if staying on Nusa Lembongan or Penida! NB much better road than that to Angel's billabong/broken beach, small entrance fee for parking."
Zhesen Tong,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2017,"I dont think I need to upload any pictures for this beautiful beach; probably this was one of the most beautiful beach I've ever been. Just go checking out yourself. It is definitely worth the trip. Climbing down the cliff was just amazing experience I've ever had; it may look very dangerous, it turns out okay as long as you watch your step and always be careful. Do bring enough water as there're some tourists asked us for water due to dehydration; Water --- very important. Otherwise, enjoy the view along the trek."
yoga p,"Nusa Penida, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"i went with three friends from spain , i went here by two motor bike , when we arived my friends very intrested and than they ask me to go down , oh my god that is very high cliff , i just imagine my self fall down and land on the coral , i must be die . they still ask me to go down , okay i follow you , i was go down very slowly , look at down very scary , the stairs just made from thin wood , around 30 minute i was arived at the beach wow that was nice clearly sand with big wave, amazing but we cant swim there because the wave to wild"
Gayan M,Male,Nov 2017,There is no word if I say experienced the blue virgin beach from the tallest cliff in Asia. ! This is the best place I have sever visit and no word to say it’s amazing. If you visit to this place there are so many small restaurant you can have a snack and meals too. I came to this place when I was in Nusa Lembongan and this place bit far from Nusa Penida harbor. You must get car or van to visit this place otherwise it’s difficult for riding motor bikes.i wish I could come this place again and it’s amazing. 
macasaetchris,"Makati, Philippines",Nov 2017,Good: 1. Stunning view! Must see in Penida!2. Easily accessible - Better roads going here than other tourist spots in Penida.Bad: 1. Can get crowded - So better go here early morning! 2. Commercialized area - Lots of huts selling food and water   
rosafjeldsoe,"Copenhagen, Denmark",Aug 2017,"This was by far the most beautiful beach I have ever been to in my life! It felt more like a green screen in front of me, rather than reality. The sand is perfectly soft. I would recommend taking the trail down to the beach and spend a good hour taking nice photos. The hike looks a bit unsafe but it is pretty sturdy, just wear appropriate trainers (do not go bear foot or wear flip flips), it only takes about 30 minutes down and 20 minutes back up (and avoid going when there is heavy rain, because if you slip on this hike you're as good as dead). The place has become super popular on social media and tourists are quickly starting to know where this secret gem is. At the top of the trail, there are a lot of tourists (with they annoying selfie sticks) blocking the whole view and they will not move for you to get a good photo, so I suggest ignore this area and make it down to the beach like the proper travellers. Also be thoughtful not to throw rubbish into this beautiful nature as Indonesia seems to be very careless with their trash, just be thoughtful and throw your trash into a bin."
Nick G,180 contributions,Sep 2017,"Definitely the number one! Not a lot of things look better in real life than on picture, this one is A LOT better seeing it with your own eyes.Make sure to take the trip down to the beach. It's part of the experience!"
Hably W,19 contributions,Nov 2017,"Beautifull.... One of the best views I've seen in my life! There is many ""cafe""  where you can buy drinks and  foods.Fix the road please.. "
Ethel F,141 contributions,Nov 2017,"I'm stunned! One of the best views I've seen in my life. Though going down will challenge you, it will be worth it. Just wear comfortable shoes since it's so steep.I don't care about my sunburn! Just go there and enjoy. 😉"
elliot197,Indonesia,Oct 2017,"We went to Nusa Penida for two days, and we had visited this place, really nice view with some rocks around, good place to visit when you're on this island."
AdrianaM,"Castletown, UK",Nov 2017,"View there was breathtaking... there is lots of places where you can buy drinks, even food. You can walk down to the beach but you have to be fit, it’s not easy and you have to take trainers with you as well as water. You can’t swim though as water is rough. "
innenurul,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Kelingking Beach is one of the most beautiful beach in Nusa Penida. The view is soo amazing.. From above we can see the blue sea and the famous part of the Island. The best part is crystal sandy beach down below where you can float on the clear sea water. To go down requires more effort and longer time. And its is impossible if you are going with a half day private tour. Another beautiful spot is at the ""neck"" of the island. Taking photo from above is also a bit scary.. But worth doing it..;) This is the best part of Nusa Penida Island."
junodj,"Salatiga, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Like another famous beach in nusa penida, u need an extra effort to reach this place. When i visited last week, the fence was broken so we can not go down to the beach, even some tourists (especially foreigners) still try to stepped down. It’s very dangerous.But u can still enjoy the best panoramic of Kelingking beach from above. Some people also name it T-Rex bay, because the shape of cliff is look like T-Rex head :D"
Susanti H,"Jambi, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"This is the most beautiful place i have ever visited. The scenery is so amazing. This place is very soothing. On the way, I did not expect the beauty of this scene to be extraordinary, really paid off. And I think in my travels, this place is a place that makes me want to linger enjoy its beauty. I wish i could stay there."
Stanzin G,"Leh, India",Nov 2017,"Kelingking beach is one of the best thing in nusa penida.. it's takes your breath away by seeing the view from the top.. but if you want to enjoy the beach , you have to be ready for the steep foot path which leads all the down to the beach.. must visit place.."
Irma M,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"I didn't know that the other side of Bali has this stunning view! It was all started with my boredom of how crowded, loud and slam-bang Bali is! I was always wanted to visit Nusa Penida and it did not disappoint!Kelingking beach was my first destination because of its famous T-rex-shaped cliff. The view from the cliff was breathtaking, I was speechless! Climbing down to enjoy the secluded beach was one of my greatest experience! However, the trail is a bit scary. So, if you guys want to climb down, please wear a good/appropriate pair of shoes. No sandals of flipflops! And be careful!"
Adi S,10 contributions,Oct 2017,Wanna know what paradise looks like . This is what u need to quench ur lust for best shade of blue coloured ocean contrasting with cliffs in green . And a beautiful beach but you have to be cautious on ur way down . But once u reach there u can have the entire beach to urself as the trail is really difficult and hardly few people attempt going down there 
Kayelene P,25 contributions,Oct 2017,"What an experience! I knew i had to go down that beach the moment I saw the photos online. Unfortunately, Im not into hiking and most specially rock climbing!!!But ok, for the love of the beach I thought, maybe it's not as bad as it looks like. WRONG. It's totally dangerous and very very risky! Going down was already a big challenge but rock climbing w/out any harness and only bamboo poles to hold onto while balancing yourself up??i know right..It's definitely a ONCE in a lifetime experience, coz i have no plans of doing that ever again hahaha😂PS:The waves there are actually scary strong and high it's almost impossible to swim anyway LOL so pls think a hundred times carefully before going down!"
SunnyFilm,"Helsinki, Finland",Oct 2017,"One of the prettiest places in Bali, I agree, but try to settle for the views from the cliff. The climb down was one of the scariest things I've done. Daredevils should at least bring a good pair of shoes, flipflops were a mistake. "
Wahyu A,1 contribution,Oct 2017,One of the most beautifull place i've ever seen. Unless access to go there isn't good. But i rate 5stars for this place 🇮🇩🤘
apatasaurus,"Kiama, Australia",Sep 2017,Fantastic views and the best photos ever!  This was a great place to take in the spectacular scenery. 
Joanna P,5 contributions,Oct 2017,"Title says everything. The whole island is mesmerizing, very few tourists, please clean up your after yourself and let it be forever beautiful :) ..."
Iswanto A,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"This is the most beautiful place I've visited in Bali. Try hike down to the beach, it's quite challenging but worth it. Be careful of the waves though."
Corn,"Stockholm, Sweden",Oct 2017,My thought went straight for the movie The beach. You will have to risk your life to climb down to the beach though. 
Fauzi Prawira,"Berau, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Great view from top of Kelingking Beach, and also beach view so beautifull and enjoy to chill. seen gradation blue water of sea."
snowflower227,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Aug 2017,"This is the most beautiful and the most dangerous beach I've ever seen in my life. The road to go there isn't in good condition but once you arrive, you won't regret. It takes around 10 mins to go down and 10 more mins to climb up, when you are at the beach, you'll feel like you escape from the real life, very soft and white sand, but the waves are so strong that you have to be careful, but chasing and running away from the waves is kind of great experience."
Jadorha,Malta,Sep 2017,You can not go to Nusa penida and not visit this amazing place. Breath thanking views you can also go a very long way down to the beach there is a quite uneasy stairs way down which is not too bad .. way up another story but if in shape enough it is totally worth it 
evanz91,"London, UK",Oct 2017,"From the viewpoint at the top of the cliffs you look down at what can only be described as a paradise beach. Be aware, the moped ride here can be dangerous! The roads/dirt tracks are not maintained and it can be very easy to fall. Also if you plan on walking along the path for a closer look you will defiantly need some trainers.  "
Nguyen080,"Ha Giang, Vietnam",Oct 2017,"Truly beautiful beach with awesome views of the cliffs of the hills and white sand beach. Maybe just need to struggle to get to this place, because road in Nusa penida not too good. But it is very compulsory to come here if travel in the Nusa Penida island."
Diaz P,96 contributions,May 2017,"If you visit to Bali, dont forget to visit Nusa Penida and this beach. Along with other places in Nusa Penida, you can find the genuine views of the sea and beach. I am agree with other reviewers, I am worry these places will be commercialized soon. If you visit to Kelingking Beach, you can see the blue ocean and of course the cliff. Please be careful if you walk to down side. No more words than say its a great holiday"
Tma,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2017,This is a must see on your visit! Amazing view and you can walk down to the beach if you brace the steep broken path.
Ardi P,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Sep 2017,I just want to stay this is amazing. Nice place in nusa penida. With white sands and blue oceans 👌👌
rohand999,"Pune, India",Sep 2017,this cannot get anything less than full stars. Just see the photos posted by travelers and you would know why. Go now before it gets commercialized.
VLASH13,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Though the way to the place is quite bumpy and looong, when you get there, it was all worth it.Too bad I went there after having too much fun in Bali Island, so when I got there, I was all tired from the nights at the club ^.^""I didn't go to the beach which waaay down there, but now that I'm home, I regretted it. I'll definitely will go again next time."
elsemiekedeunk,"Utrecht, The Netherlands",Sep 2017,"Although they say it's dangerous, the hike to the beach is very nice when you've good shoes. Highly recommended to go down, but be careful though! "
alexfilip95,"Grosseto, Italy",Sep 2017,"The best beach of Bali and islands around, situated in Nusa Penida island , 1 hour far from bali by fast boat, it s one of the best beaches i've ever seen and i've seen many in my life, it was incredible, first day we were there with guide and as long as we loved it so much we comed again nxt day and gone down to the beach , it s a little bit dangerous but it will be worth it once on the beach , definitely a must if u have enough time in Bali!"
James F,5 contributions,Sep 2017,Remember to take a few bottles of water!  Take your time if you are going to climb down to the beach!  It is not for the faint of heart but is absolutely worth the climb.  Enjoyed a couple of coconuts after the climb out to help with rehydration!
Tienti R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Breathtaking view, and I regret that I didn't go down to the beaches below. It's crowded but it's worthy of your time and effort. Peoples start to build facilities like toilet, local shop for you taking a rest in the hot temperature, enjoying the scene while drinking coconut."
agostonpeti,"Budapest, Hungary",Sep 2017,This place is the most amazing place i have ever visited. Fortunately we arrived earlier than most of the tourist did. We were alone on the beach. Cannot describe. You have to see. 30 mins trekking down (shoes highly recommended) 20 mins up. You can rest at the beach. 
Paul M,United Kingdom,Aug 2017,"We came here very early in the morning to beat the crowds! We had the whole place to ourselves and even climbed down the precarious path to the beach. The roads leading to this place are very dodgy so be cautious, if you're inexperienced on a scooter be careful!! We stayed here for a couple of hours and by the time we climbed back to the top from the beach people were arriving  and would definitely of changed our experience for the worse so make the effort in coming here early! We took lots of pictures and nobody was in any of them!The beach isn't safe to swim in either as the waves are to crazy!"
Jesslyn W,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"not far from Pasih Uug there is another beach in Nusa Penida called Kelingking Beach. Because of the shape that resembles the finger Kelingking (little fingger), we can go down to swim or just play water. the water is very clear and white sand, if we are lucky we can see Manta Ray fish even in large quantities. Will never regret visiting this place"
Nadiaandita,"Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Kelingking Beach have beautiful scenery, but you have to climb a long way to go down until 1 hour and very hot. nothing to do in there just taking photos"
ireneario,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"Very beautiful scenery from above to the blue turquoise sea, got a great fotos of this beach, need a short deep dawn hill to get best spot for foto but it worth it 👍🏾"
Evelien K,5 contributions,Sep 2017,You have to climb a long way down so put on good shoes and don't go in the middle of the day (too hot)
Globe T,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2017,Lovely view point and excellent spot for photography. Lovely place to visit when in PENIDA island. Good
Pappmelinda,"San Mateo, CA",Aug 2017,"Breathtaking view! We saw huge manta rays swimming below, they must have been at least 6-8ft across. I wish we had more time and hiked down to the beach below. "
Dan R,"Busan, South Korea",Aug 2017,"Beautiful views from the top! The stairs looked a little dangerous to walk down, although many people were doing so, if you plan on doing it, I'd definitely bring proper shoes, as I slipped at the top in flip flops. The colour of the water looks just like the photos."
laorajj,"Brussels, Belgium",Aug 2017,"Once you arrive to Kelingking Beach you will see one of the most beautiful landscapes of the island! You can also go down, I tried but I didn't feel so comfortable so I came back. My boyfriend went down and he said that it is a little bit difficult but could be manageable. The beach is very beautiful, we could even see mantas from the top on the sea!"
MissPixieLix,Sydney Australia,Aug 2017,"This place looks like a postcard. You can if you like walk or hike right down to the bottom, but we were told it's not the easiest place to get to. We were happy to take pics from the top. Beautiful "
zeeyogy,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2017,"A hidden treasure, quite easy to get there by bike/car (remember to bring small change for parking fees).  Aerial view of the beach is just a minute walk from the parking area itself; getting down to the beach is a 45 minute trek. Not advisable for the those who are unfit. Untouched beach, a perfect place to get a tan, relax and unwind."
NidhiRana,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,One of the best beaches I have ever seen. Water is so blue & sand is so white. You have to trek down to reach this beautiful beach but it is totally worth it.
Vijay_Leo,"Bengaluru, India",Aug 2017,"Hidden beach which literally 'appears' in front of you... view is breathtaking, with numerous shades of blue all around, school of fishes in the vicinity, with an occasional Manta Ray... walk down to the beach is tiring, but worth the effort... a true hidden treasure... Must Visit"
Danqu,"Frankfurt, Germany",Aug 2017,"You can just enjoy the view fro the top or go down to the beach if you have good shoes, are ready to do some climbing and steep descent and are in good fisical form. "
Grace B,"Penguin, Australia",Aug 2017,"In our flip flops and dresses we got the this beach expecting just a nice swim.... little did we know we were about the hike down the scariest hike of our lives. Holding on for dear life on the floppy bamboo fencing, and gripping on the rocking sandy path. We spoke to many people on the way about it they said it was definitely an adventure. They were right. It was the most memorable adventure of Nusa Penida. It took about an hour for a group of 7 girls to get down. Once reaching the bottom the sizes of the waves become huge to you and you realise that all the hard effort you put into getting down can not be rewarded with a swim, but just a dipping of the feet. Many girls getting knocked over by the force of the waves. After a nice relaxing lie down and looking up and around what you just conquered it's time to head back up. Going barefoot up and down was what we did. And I must say with a little help from upper body strength going up was a lot easier. I'll never forget that afternoon and the views are incredible!!"
linachen,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"This place is owesome. The white of the sand and the fierce of the wave are incredible even you have to get down from the high hill (above +/-1.9km from up stair) But your effort will pay off when you get down to the hill. Using the right shoes will help you easier to reach the beach. Trust me, you have to reach the beach when you @Pantai Kelingking, Nusa Penida or you will be regret :)"
Waleed F,"Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,The beach down the hill is amazing if you have the fitness to go down and come back to the top again after finishing.
Corwin I,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Aug 2017,"The view from above is amazing, but after the climb it's even better! Don't mistake the claims down, it's hard! But worth it! "
Ronit Dalvi,"Ostend, Belgium",Jul 2017,"This beach is also called t-rex point as the cliff resembles the shape of a t-rex,  it's a beautiful place to visit, you can get to the beach from the t-rex point, it's a short hike, wearing good shoes comes in handy.This is one of the best place on the nusa penida island.Must visit."
Jennifer S,"Berlin, Germany",Aug 2017,"It is a really nice place. After a bumpy ride you have to pay 5k for parking and then you find the view. It is really crowded and people are making really dangerous ""stunts"" just for the ""best"" selfie. I always though it's a rumour that people are putting there selfs in dangerous situations for the perfect selfie but there you go…Other than that it is a really nice place 👍P.S make sure you have enough petrol in your scooter "
suviatyw,"Pekanbaru, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Amazing view, this place was a bit far, drive need 2 hour. But  view was very very beautifull .... worth it, with long jorney and the road go there was very bad and small. Difficult to past between 2 car."
Kevin L,101 contributions,Aug 2017,This is the most eye-opening place that I've ever visited in bali.The landscape and lovely blue coloured sea and sky makes the bumpy motor-bike ride there worthwhile.
Lina chandra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,Beautiful view from the top and so many people will queue to take the photos at the edge facing the beach down under but be careful as you may fall down ! Some accidents happened before when people doing selfie. You may go down to Kelingking beach but the steps is dangerous and steepy. I dont recommend unless you are so fit and adventurous.You can take pictures at the dead tree and the bamboo boat paying only 5K per person.The coconut is rather expensive they charge you 25-30K for one. At this moment there is no restaurant so bring your own lunch box as the island has no many restaurants and less choice. But they do sell cup noodles.
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,Nusa Penida is such a beautiful island with one spot more beautiful than the other. Kelingling beach was breathtaking but we didn't have time to walk down the staircase and the top bit was filled with tourists. Hopefully next time we will get to walk down for better views. 
Lokaris,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"Kelingking is awesome, every step descending offers different view. We didn't manage to reach the beach as sunset is approaching and am awared that it takes a whole lot of stamina and flexibility to reach the beach, which I don't have that time.Thanks to the people who did great job attaching the handle and steps that made it safe to reach the beach. Sunset was stunning.  "
Lawrensha,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2017,"One of Best spot on Nusa Penida you must visit. The beach is like a little finger (or kelingking in Indonesia Languange). Beware of you take selfies, thr fences are very small. There's a staircase to walk down to the beach. Our guide told us it'll take about 35-40 minutes each way. I wished we had more time but it was a daytrip and we wanted to see other places so we didnt Go ahead down to the beach."
Carlotripad,11 contributions,Jul 2017,"This place has a magnificent view. The road to get there is not too bad, but once you approach the cliff, make sure to have good shoes for climbing down to the beach. Totally worth it!"
Eshita17,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Feb 2017,"its the best I have ever seen , best in my Bali visit too !Our tour guide recommended it , absolutely mind blowing view of the Sea ...never seen someplace so picture perfect and beautiful !!!"
clairecremeens,"San Marcos, TX",Jul 2017,"Simply wow. This was by far the most beautiful beach I've ever seen...but I had to earn my access to it. The stairs and handrails are strong enough to hang onto, but you'll be taking some big steps down. Going back up is an actual climb. But to get to one of the most beautiful white sand beaches and bluest water, it was worth it entirely!"
Ruth T,82 contributions,Jul 2017,"This is one of the best view in Nusa Penida! The stunning cliffs and clearly pearly greenish blue waves will overwhelm you. Yes, we can climb down the cliff to its beach. For me it's worth one try because the beach is just the same look with the ones from other parts of world. But hey, it's a really nice holiday photoshoot down there. Be careful on your way down and up, it's really steep. The government and locals have installed wooden (bamboo?) to help you gripping along the way, but still we all need to concentrate when going down and up. I think it will be best if we visit Kelingking around 8-10 o'clock in the morning. First, it won't be very hot (walking down and up the cliff won't be comfort at the noon. It burns). Secondly, maybe the crowd has not arrived so we are more free exploring and taking picture. The road leading to the beach has now been improved. It's only some bumpy road, but mostly it's smooth.You must visit this place when you are in Bali! Enjoy :)Ps: bring water"
Dirk G,26 contributions,Jul 2017,Such a amazing view! You can also descent to the beach but the stairsvare pretty crazy...and you will not be able to swimmat all becausenof very strong current
NafeeTA,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2017,"You need to trek through a steep but safe path to get down to the beach, somewhat tiring, but totally worth the trek. One of the must visits in Bali"
Ayu wulandari,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"we start our journey with this marvelous beach And it hit us! We saw the hill track from upside and thaught it will be not that 'hardcore' but after 5 min down, yes we fell the rock. They still don't have proper stair to step, instead they have temporary made by wood handle and stair. We really train our muscles here, running breath, and tears (for my sister lol). It was mostly like wall climbing without any safe as the hill is really steep. You have to prepare your physic and mental before you down because once you did no one ever can lift you up and down even a helicopter. Lol. But every those drama are really worth it! The beach is aweeeeesome. Ps : i suggest you to climb down and feel the water. It's really worth it.And please wear your shoes rather than flip flops :D"
Josefine J,"Linköping, Sweden",Jul 2017,"Amazing experience! We climbed down and took a bath at the beach, it was wonderful! The climb though was very hard and steep, so not recommended for the old or badly trained people 😁"
Sanchita G,26 contributions,Jul 2017,Colour of the water is surreal. Avoid rainy days if possible.No pictures can do justice to the actual view. A must visit. If you are travelling without kids (unlike us) do trek down
barryjap,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Jul 2017,I wished we had more time but it was a daytrip and we wanted to see other places so we didnt Go ahead! down to the beach itself. I recommend highly to speare some time and Go ahead! down to the beach. We saw a manta from all the way up plaing near the beach....how cool is that?
Greg Massacra,"Galway, Ireland",Jul 2017,Another point of trip on Nusa Penida you must see. Unfortunately we didn't go down to the bottom as we wre already after all day walking but view from the top is spectacular. Colour of water and sand is so beautiful. And all rocks around it. Ahhhh... :-)
marcel l,28 contributions,Jun 2017,"Even the view from above is amazing. Great place for panorama pictures. Way to the beach is easy to find, parking for 2000Rp.If you wanna climb down to the beach you should bring solid shoes.  It is a bit hard to do it in thongs /flip flops.Once your are down at the beach... it is fantastic.Nice sand... good waves and less people.Keep the beach clean and take your rubbish with you. "
IUlv,"Oslo, Norway",Jul 2017,"Beautiful view and a highlight in Nusa Penida. The hike down to the beach was a bit scary, but I'm happy we did it. It was well worth it and a good workout. "
pohling_foo,"George Town, Malaysia",Jun 2017,The t-Rex head. Beautiful spot for pictures! There's a staircase to walk down to the beach. Our guide told us it'll take about 35-40 minutes each way. 
blue_ring001,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"We chartered a speed boat out of Sanur Semawang beach and travelled for 45 minutes to Crystal Bay. This is one of the popular dive site to look for mola mola or sun fish. But this was not a dive trip so we jumped to the white sandy beach and a car already waited for us. The driving time to kelingking beach took about an hour because the road condition was not perfect. Once we arrived, the spectacular view made you forget all the bumpy and slow drive. The view from above the cliff was just amazing, perfect for picture taking. We could walk down 100 meter to the beach but decided not to because I was not sure we can climb back up. The best approach would be to walk down the cliff and leave by boat from the beach below."
mollfrog,"Newcastle, Australia",Jun 2017,"Kelingking Beach is about 30 mins from Crystal Beach by scooter. The middle part of the journey is quite bumpy due to the notoriously pothole-filled roads, which get better closer to the destination. Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat). I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled). Both the descent and ascent are quite laborious, and the pocari sweat back up top was welcomed gladly. This experience was unbelievable. I would do it again in a heartbeat. "
Darmanto S,"Malang, Indonesia",Jun 2017,"Hidden beach below 350m cliff. Not prepare to walk down, but still worth to see from the top. Very beautiful nature"
socrwill,"Redding, CA",Jun 2017,This is the most dangerously beautiful place I have ever seen or been. Climbing down 2000 feet of raw cliff via slippery spots with a small bamboo rail and rope is no small task for a guy afraid of heights. Having a 20' wave take your feet out from under you is also very humbling. Being alone with the most beautiful woman on the most spectacular beach in Bali is bucket list priceless!
Max C,"Palm Beach, FL",Jun 2017,Need to be in decent shape to do this. We went to the bottom. It was not an easy hike. It was short but very tough coming from the bottom. Practically wall climbing - using more of your arms then legs at first. Incredible sights from every point during the hike. Beach at the bottom is the most beautiful beach I've ever been on. 
harry_mdj,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2017,"The beach is actually a narrow white sand beach between cliffs like Atuh Beach. The differences from Atuh are the beach is hardly to be accessed (the nature stairs tens meters down to the beach is slippery and very narrow and steep.The Kelingking secret point has a very beautiful panoramic view to the cliffs and the beach bellow.Some say it's kind of Navagio Beach, Greece."
Chrys,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2017,"This place has a unique rock formation, other than Broken Beach. It was named Kelingking Beach and it may refer to the indonesian word for ""thumb"" but idk it does not look like a thumb for me lol. The view is spectacular and I would really love to go to the beach down there but I don't have the guts to do it so I just stay on the top of the cliff and adore the view."
Frostburne,"Bandung, Indonesia",May 2017,"Visited the place for day trip from Sanur.  This place is 30 min away from the port. The road is a bit bumpy so watch out.  But the view is well worthed.  The beach is like a little finger (or kelingking in Bahasa).  Beware of you take selfies,  thr fences are very small. "
maleeam23,"Bozeman, MT",May 2017,GORGEOUS!!! Views from here are incredible!! If you get there early enough you can hike down to the beach which would be AWESOME but it would be quite a trek. We went on a tour with Discover Nusa Penida which I would highly recommend! Must see highlight of our trip!!
196A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2017,Beautiful cliff and horizon view. Located less than an hour by car from Angel's Billabong / Broken Beach. You can enjoy the view from above or you can go down to the beach with a note; you have to be in good condition. It requires a great stamina to go steep 500-700ft down and climb back. At some point your knee will be in front of your belly while climbing up the steep stairs (if it can be called so). The path also not really safe since there was no fence/net/bar good enough to prevent accident.
