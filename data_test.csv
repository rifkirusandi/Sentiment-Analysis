As you reach the beach at the end of Jl Pantai Batau Bolong, you will find bars, cafes and restaurants serving hungry tourists and surfers. There are also surf boards for hire. The main mode of transport to get here is by scooter which can be hired almost anywhere or taxi. It is also a great spot to watch the sun set or just pop on one of the sun lounges set up by locals with their little shacks that sell beers and soft drinks and food. The lounges are free if you purchase a beverage with them.

17-Jan,Canggu Beach is a black sand volcanic beach which makes it look a little unattractive for us Australians used to white sand and sparkling blue seas. However I found it a really good place to hang out and have conversations with fellow travellers at various bars that line the sand. These range from wildly expensive (Western priced) complete with swimming pools and lovely lounging furniture through to cheap little warnings which offer bean bags under beach umbrellas. There was a bit of surf when I was there and its possible to hire boards. I am a little reluctant to swim in south Bali ocean because of poor  sewage and a big population but lots of people were taking the plunge. It was boisterous sea so be careful if you are a weak swimmer - lots of sandbanks and turbulence.

I could not imagine going anywhere else now!! It was the perfect place if you're a young professional looking for a bit of night life without the party scene.  Everywhere felt new, clean, and the perfect mix of boho/Balinese culture.  We stayed in an Air BnB right off the main drive but in a fairly quiet space and it was PERFECT.  Walking distance to the beach, Love Anchor, Crate Cafe, and any restaurant or happy hour you could desire.  We moved locations half way through our trip to another city and actually took a taxi back to Canggu on our last day because we just couldn't get enough!

On this occasion, I had guests staying with me at my Villa and I had assured them this should be ticked off their bucket list!   As always, several ""Beer boys"" descended upon us and I ordered 3 chilled beers, as we were ushered to some rather old and grubby looking laybacks.   As they were uncomfortable on our backs, we requested chairs.  Anyway, the beer was chilled to perfection.  As the beers were delivered I was advised that it would cost each of us IDR to sit on these chairs, about which I was most embarrassed in front of my friends.  I paid the bill when we left and added IDR for the uncomfortable laybacks, making it perfectly clear that such demands are damaging the image of 66 Beach and people will go elsewhere for their beers.On top of that, Taxi's were asking IDR100,000 to transfer back to Seminyak because of 66 being 1-way!

I hired a sun lounge, to relax but every few minutes a peddler came. They do not care for your peace & quiet. Even when you say no, the lady peddlers grab your feet and say “foot massage ?” Several times despite you declining. No personal boundaries. You have to be rude to get them to leave. So for 2 hours I hired a lounge and had no break from them. I don’t think they understand how many of them come at you. It’s too much !!! Even when you go to the beach cafes at double six they are allowed in the restaurant while your eating .....to hassle you to buy. Even when your about to take a mouthful of food they come right up. I was trying to be polite ,but it was just too much for me to enjoy my time there.  The food is very average, but the sunsets are lovely. The ocean isn’t always clean and some plastic and packaging floated past as I swam. There are many surf schools at double six beach but no designated area for them so wherever you swim be prepared for learner surfers to come crashing toward you. Ha ha .

Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn.

I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs.

The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!! Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror. We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time.

Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.

There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions.
