Oct 2012,"We spent a day at Echo Beach, a short drive from Canggu, and an hour and a half from Ubud, where we were staying. The beach is not Bali's prettiest, nor its cleanest, but it does have decent surf for beginner to intermediate surfers, and is laid back enough to be enjoyable for a day trip. We had our 3 children, ages 7, 7, and 10, with us. They took a 2-hour lesson with the Canggu Surf School, which was well worth the money ($60 p.p. for 2 hours). The beach has a single alley with a few shops, and a handful of restaurants, so don't visit expecting the full-on, Bali tourist experience. In my opinion, this is a GOOD thing! The people who come here seem to be more relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak, and the lack of in-your-face commercialism is refreshing. I suspect the area was nicer a few years ago, before rampant development got underway. Right now, there's an enormous hotel going up, as well as a large number of apartments, and it detracts from the overall ""undiscovered"" vibe of the place. Probably has another year or so before it succumbs to the unzoned, unplanned development chaos that has subsumed a lot of Bali. Two unexpected high points: (1) The Echo Beach cafe, nearest to the temple, has a sensational BBQ every night. Worth staying past dark for! (2) If you like motorcycle/surf culture, the Deus Ex Machina Temple of Enthusiasm is just down the road.",spent day echo short drive canggu hour half ubud stay bali pretty cleanest decent surf beginner intermediate surfer lay back enough enjoyable day trip 3 child age 7 7 10 u take 2hour lesson canggu surf school well worth money 60 pp 2 hour single alley shop handful restaurant dont visit expect fullon bali tourist experience opinion good thing people come seem relaxed kuta seminyak lack inyourface commercialism refresh suspect area nicer year ago rampant development get underway right now theres enormous hotel go well large number apartment detract overall undiscovered vibe place probably another year succumbs unzoned unplanned development chaos subsume lot bali two unexpected high point 1 echo cafe near temple sensational bbq every night worth stay past dark 2 motorcyclesurf culture deus ex machina temple enthusiasm road,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9442}",0.9442,positive

Not too crowded, plenty of beach chairs to rent (50K IDR for two), inexpensively priced cold beers and drinks, and occasionally two vendors selling chicken satay and roasted corn on the cob (15K for satay, 10K for corn). Lots of beginning surfers, taking their 10 min lesson and then heading for the water with their instructors. We had Putu (sp?) who was fantastic with the kids. Dragged them out to sea, launched them on selected waves, and let them go. They were able to stand up, each of them, several times, and came back declaring that they loved surfing. Not all instructors were as hard working and diligent as he, so ask for him if you can. He's usually in the last surf hut on the left of the little strip of huts to the right of the temple (his is closest to the temple). Standard rate is 350K for 2 hours. The number and quality of waves is great for beginners, and the water is pretty shallow for those who just want to play. But there are plenty of waves that can be a bit strong, so maybe not so great for very small children.

Jun 2014,Nice to take a walk when it's not to hot. Canggu beach is mainly a surf beach without much (sun-)bathing accomodation. There is often a lot of thrash on the beach left there by the tides and feeded by the rivers of Bali and Java. Despite the overpopulation and 9 million visitors a year there is no proper thrash collection on Bali. The Balinese even avoid often the paid service there is and throw their thrash in the rivers. It ends up in the sea and the tide brings it to the beach including used pampers and worse. Just dumping in the sea also goes for the sewage. The whole island with millions of people doing there thing right into the sea. The consequences are that survers are confronted with ear infections and worse. The surfers are by the way the only people who can go safely into the sea. Bathing is risky because of the treacherous currents which take every year several people who drown. But it's a nice beach to walk.,nice take walk hot canggu mainly surf without much sunbathing accomodation often lot thrash leave tide feed river bali java despite overpopulation 9 million visitor year proper thrash collection bali balinese even avoid often pay service throw thrash river end sea tide brings include used pampers worse dump sea go sewage whole island million people thing right sea consequence survers confront ear infection bad surfer way people go safely sea bath risky treacherous current take every year several people drown nice walk,"{'neg': 0.214, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.8555}",-0.8555,negative

Nov 2015,"The first time I went to Canggu was in June 2014. It was then still relatively quiet beach (I visited Batu Bolong), especially if you compare with Kuta. I fell in love with Canggu and longed to get back. Now, being back a couple of times I start to see more clearly and I have adjusted my opinion about Canggu.Canggu is used to be covered by abundance rice fields and limitless coconut trees at her beaches, the saying goes. But now it is becoming, pitifully, more and more like her oldest sisters, Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Here and there you can see pieces of rice fields, but villa's at various styles and sizes are becoming the dominant landscape. Surfers come for all over the world to use this place as their playground. Cafe's and Bar, all made to fit the western styles, are in abundance. I do not get this. If you are on holiday in exotic country, why on earth you want to have croissant with bacon for breakfast, mozzarella salad for lunch and spare ribs for dinner? Try nasi bungkus instead at local waroeng for ‚Ç¨ 0.4 ( Rp. 5.000). Try kopi tubruk (Balinese coffee) instead of espresso. And ask for a bike for transportation, instead of a motorcycle. Perhaps by doing this there is a vain hope that the damage is a little less than worst.The mass tourism, wherein I, myself, also participate, has contributed to the loss of more and more rice fields or to put it more critically, the loss of Balinese' authenticity and its nature.  How ironic the fate of Balinese. Thousand of years ago they run away from the influence of Islam by sailing from Java to be able to preserve its culture, only to be now slowly destroyed by mass tourism.

Mar 2019,"Nice place to stay if you wanna watch the sunset, people go here to surf too. We stayed at a beach front restaurant so we could watch the sunset without the hassle of where to stay.One downside is going and leaving here. There is a local conflict between Grab/GoJek/BlueBird and local taxis here. It is kinda traumatizing since we already booked a grab, and we were already inside the car when a guy in a motorcycle followed us and forced us to go down. Apparently, grab is not allowed in that area. It was scary since it‚Äôs in the middle of the night, we were forced to walk to our hotel, and the streets are already dark. No cars/scooters were passing. The guy in a motorcycle was harassing the grab and kept shouting (we dont know the language coz they spoke indonesian).We are tourists so we dont know where to get a taxi (since there are no taxi around) so Grab is the most convenient way, yet somehow, some of the locals cant understand that. Also, if you choose the option to ride them, it is freaking expensive compared to taxi and grab considering the distance is only 1-2km away. They will charge you for as much as 150k. None of us also know how to drive a scooter so we cant rent one (most of the tourist here rent a scooter to go to places since it‚Äôs a lot cheaper, cars could be really expensive here)To the local government of Bali, please fix this.
