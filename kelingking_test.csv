Jun 2017,"Kelingking Beach is about 30 mins from Crystal Beach by scooter. The middle part of the journey is quite bumpy due to the notoriously pothole-filled roads, which get better closer to the destination. Upon arrival, you'll be asked to pay a 5000rph parking fee.There is a warung up the top that sells food, and closer to the cliff is a stall that sells water and electrolyte drinks (pocari sweat). I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled). Both the descent and ascent are quite laborious, and the pocari sweat back up top was welcomed gladly. This experience was unbelievable. I would do it again in a heartbeat.

Sep 2019,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope. The least they can do is adequately inform tourists, who rock up in flipflops and carrying helmets, or in dresses for their Instagram photoshoot. Both hands are needed to literally climb up many stretches of the path, and nice clothes will end up dirty and torn.

Apr 2018,"Overall, it is a pain in the butt for a modest pay-off. The infrastructure on Nusa Penida is over-run with tourists. 8 of 10 vehicles that are beating the roads into a bombed-out wasteland are tourist vans, vying to keep two wheels on the pavement and hopefully two wheels on the shoulder. The convoy often comes to a stop and even backs up to create a little room for an oncoming convoy of tourist vans. Much of the road to Kelingking Broken is completely destroyed by tourist van traffic, leaving the locals in a horrible position. The vies is spectacular, but it's barely worth the nausea-inducing kidney-battering ride to get there. The scenery along the way is only a modest consolation for the tough ride because there‚Äôs so much garbage. Garbage EVERYWHERE.

The hike to Beach below was extreme and I thought to myself after I got halfway down this is going to get easier now.  Ha Ha.

(Hint bring water and good shoes)   The beach on bottom was amazing with perfect sand and perfect water.  The hike out was not as bad as hike in since its easier to climb then descend since you can use your hands.

From the top you can see amazing views of the beach and you can even spot manta ray fish, we could see at least 4. Then we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so we can swim in beautiful turquoise sea and play in the white soft sand. However, there was almost no stairs, it was more similar to climbing a rocky mountain, it was very steep, long, and challenging. Wearing a shoe for this hike is a must. The first half of the broken stairs was fine but the other half was definitely harder, no stairs, only broken rocks to step on. I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs. After finally reaching the bottom, it was all still beautiful, but the sea was also rough, high waves and strong tide, so it was hard to relax in the sea. In the beach there was only one small place selling some drinks and snacks. Overall, it was definitely very beautiful, the view and scene was amazing.

Apr 2018,"I've been to Bali numerous times and visited many of its beaches but Kelingking Beach is particularly outstanding. The view from the cliff is just amazing and (if you're fit enough to descend to the beach and climb back up) the beach itself is very rewarding. Yes! It's quite an effort to go down to the beach, but that what makes it worth the effort. The sand, the wave, everything is so perfect.If you wanna go down to the beach, my recommendation is to go there early in the morning. Travel light. Going down to the beach is quite dangerous.. use practical and comfortable sandals. While down there.. just enjoy the beach for a couple of hours.. You could also bring bento to have lunch down there. After you gain back your energy then climb back up.

Jul 2017,"This is one of the best view in Nusa Penida! The stunning cliffs and clearly pearly greenish blue waves will overwhelm you. Yes, we can climb down the cliff to its beach. For me it's worth one try because the beach is just the same look with the ones from other parts of world. But hey, it's a really nice holiday photoshoot down there. Be careful on your way down and up, it's really steep. The government and locals have installed wooden (bamboo?) to help you gripping along the way, but still we all need to concentrate when going down and up. I think it will be best if we visit Kelingking around 8-10 o'clock in the morning. First, it won't be very hot (walking down and up the cliff won't be comfort at the noon. It burns). Secondly, maybe the crowd has not arrived so we are more free exploring and taking picture. The road leading to the beach has now been improved.
