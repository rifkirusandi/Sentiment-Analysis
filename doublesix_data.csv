ChrisThomasTravels,"Ossining, NY",Dec 2019,"One of the most popular beaches in Bali, Double Six Beach attracts crowds of tourists from nearby Kuta, Legian and Seminyak. The waves are mild here - perfect for first time surfers. Plenty of sunchairs to sit on, umbrellas to sit under, and coolers full of beers to sip."
Chelsea B,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2019,The beach was quite busy and as a consequence you'll find lots of people touting things from sunglasses to boat tours but the beach itself was nice and cleaner than some we'd come across.
Finds_posts,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2019,"a very touristy place. lots of restaurants, gift shops and the water isn't that really clear like in Maldives or Ibiza. foods are very cheap in here"
Udita,3 contributions,May 2019,Cleaner than seminayk or kuta beach .There are other better beaches in bali than this. Good beach clubs to enjoy closeby like cucoon beach club
Marjut0303,"Vantaa, Finland",Nov 2019,"Nice double six beach in Seminyak Bali, worth visiting! Also comfortable sun beds on the beach and the sunsets are amazing colourful! There are some cosy restaurants where to eat; food was excellent!"
Kev,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Aug 2019,"Very nice beach to take a stroll. Although you get HOUNDED by people trying to sell you things. You don't get left alone for too long, which gets annoying. "
Peter R,"Liverpool, UK",Dec 2019,"Good beach, nice and clean,  good surf if you like that sort of thing.  I walked from Double Six down to Kuta beach and then returned north to Seminyak beach. A lovely afternoon barefoot walk."
vanessasmith75,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2019,Nice spot to hang out with friends. We can see also sunset which is amazing. Beside that there are many options of restaurants we can choose along the beach. 
2TravellingGeordies,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Dec 2019,Wrote a previous review up our stay in Seminyak and visiting the beaches here in Bali.Found Double 6 beach filled with plastics from high to low water. Nothing in the way of locals picking up the rubbish ranging from plastic bottle tops to plastic bags and old rope. How much damage is all this rubbish doing to marine life and not to mention the tourists entering these waters... the rubbish is not from tourism but from the rivers that flood once rain has fallen. Once you look beyond the rubbish I wonder how much none seen pollutants are in there!!!?.
Chris S,3 contributions,Dec 2019,"Great for surfing but not for swimming as the sea is too rough. Evenings are great as the bars & restaurants along the beach prepare for the amazing sunsets with lanterns, candles, comfy bean bag chairs & live music which all contributes to a memorable time"
kimseouhyoon,"Seoul, South Korea",Dec 2019,"The location is very close from city , you can enjoy the beach and buy coconut water during waiting the beautiful sunset"
stephenpysc,"Shanghai, China",Oct 2019,"This is the section of the beach in Bali that is relaxed and has everything you need from water sports, to surfing, to chair and drinks. Great for sunset.!"
Dumbamakeche,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2019,Good beach to spend our time while waiting for the golden hour (sunset) so many restaurant around here and local deli (Bakso gerobak biru) is delicious and affordable. 
Cameliapark,2 contributions,Aug 2019,"It was my second time in Bali, still beautiful as always and this beach is the most beautiful here. Definitely will visit this beach every time i come to bali."
smithtan,12 contributions,Dec 2019,Really recommended. One of the best place to get the magical sunset where many bar surriunding to entertain you.
Amanda & Moha,13 contributions,Oct 2019,"Had so much fun at double six last time i was there im going again in the next few days. There will be a break in the rain and I'm there. Very impressed with the food but you cant beat the atmosphere with lanterns under coloured umbrellas. Have to mention the double apple shisha and the bands. The lovely happy staff and the waves crashing, its an awesome sunset."
GlobetrotterJ16,"Seoul, South Korea",Mar 2019,"Double Six is a wide beach area between Seminyak and Kuta. A few hotels are next to it but it is one of the more underdeveloped areas of Bali. When we were there the beach was quite dirty, it was shocking to be honest, according to some reviews it has improved a lot it seems. We strolled along the beach all the way from Seminyak to Kuta and it is a fantastic beach walk, and once the sun starts to set even more picturesque."
widya artika,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2019,"We really took a great time here to enjoy the sunset. The service was good and comfortable, we didn't even realise the time here as we talked and enjoyed the view."
Nikz1390,"Jaipur, India",Nov 2019,Good place to relax with various shacks and places to sit . Most restaurants have sitting area and evening live music on beach at restaurants 
Swanand Oak,3 contributions,Nov 2019,"A lot of cafes, bars and restaurants with variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options. Prompt service by staff."
The World is My Oyster,"Orlando, FL",Nov 2019,Really couldn't get enough on how incredibly amazing the sunset was. The beach got real crowded with hundreds of colorful bean bags and umbrellas. The live music was also so cool and created an amazing atmosphere. An absolute must do while in Bali!
Indira N,3 contributions,Oct 2019,"Lovely beach club right by the beach, great music, food and ambiance, a definite hit! I had an awesome time everytime I came, which was often."
KevMac1960,"Stanford-Le-Hope, UK",Nov 2019,Nice enough beach which appeared to be pretty popular with surfers. Unfortunately it seemed a bit grubby to me and the hawkers were a bit of a pain. It was all ok but I imagine their nicer places to spend a day on the sand. I may not be a good reviewer for this place as I’m not really a beach person ha ha
Tissai,"Brno, Czech Republic",Nov 2019,"Nice Beach, not suitable for swimming, but great for surfing. Many bars with live music in evening to watch the sunset."
MaryBolo,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2019,We loved it here! The atmosphere was amazing and the sunset was out of the world! Definitely a must visit when visiting Bali💕
N2N,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2019,"Wonderful beach to holiday, great place to watch sunset with a drink, food and music, good for families and couple."
mutiaraputrilestari,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,"Double Six Beach is one of the never ending happening spot in Bali! What makes it become everyone's favourite is because it's strategic location for a sunset catcher, not too far away from Kuta Beach but way cleaner, nice sand and has a lot of fancy beach bars and restos to chill out. We can find a lot of domestic and foreign tourists here have fun by soaking up the sun, playing by the beach or surfing."
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Sep 2019,"Were there last year, and really was not impressed with the beach itself, it seemed scraggy and dirty and were some dogs Doo doo really didn’t want to do more than a paddle, this year I still felt slightly uncomfortable walking through so we decided to carry on walking up the beach and we found some proper bars and seats and it felt as if we had gone to another part of the island, it was so clean and tidy and we could sit down on bean bags and we ended up going there the rest of the 10 days to the spot on the beach and I really started enjoying it and felt a lot better and continued to go into the Chiringuito Restaurant & Bar – Highly recommended and definitely going back again- Thank you"
Maureen M,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2019,Fine groomed sand and lovely warm waters. Take the locals knowledge on board on deciding best time of day to go surfing.  They are accurate within an hour.  Look out for rips and undertows which are endorsed by red flags alond beach.  It is otherwise a very nice safe beach.Plenty of cafes and surf board hire places along the beach. We paid 50000IDR (about 5 AUD) per hour for surfboard hire. Reallly good sate sticks cooked over coal   at Capil Cafe.Plenty of shopping opportunities in and around Double six beach.
Jean1823,"Nagoya, Japan",Oct 2019,"great view of the sunset.. many vendors too, even at the bar they will approach you ;( but not as congested as Kuta. We walked by the beach from Kuta, and from Kuta beach to Double Six Beach the waves are nonstop so it’s good for surfing but not swimming."
Kate N,"Largs Bay, Australia",Oct 2019,Get down and see Carlos for a beach chair. Gorgeous beach. Lots of fun in the surf. Watch out for the rips. Make sure you swim between the flags. Gorgeous sunset. K-Resto has good meals. 
Russ Lacuata,"Long Beach, CA",Oct 2019,"Great spot to view the sunset. Clean and not too crowded. Plenty of space to move around, or too place ball. Family friendly. "
BJM,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Oct 2019,Well it is still not as clean as it could be...but much much better than it has been...we all need to help keep any beach clean and enjoyable for all. The surf school was a good place for the kids to have a go at surfing...the instructors were quite patient...it was a fun time
Malferg,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2019,"It's a nice, clean and not overcrowded beach. It's quite wide and dotted with umbrella's and lounges for rent and lots of Beach Clubs and Bars . There are a heaps of Traders flogging their wares. If you're like me and dont go to Kuta this is the place to watch the sunset."
Ellenia R,"Bandung, Indonesia",Oct 2019,I came to this beach for watch the sunset and the view it's really amazing. I can't describe with words but it really beautiful
Louise H,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2019,"Spent the day here, beautiful resort and staff very friendly. Loved the restaurant,  fresh and delicious food. Highly recommend!"
myers9720,"Oceanside, CA",Sep 2019,My husband and I really enjoyed this beach. It’s very reasonable to rent lounge chairs and an umbrella. They give surf lessons here and it’s fun to watch everyone. Lots  of restaurants on the beach with okay food. The beach is very clean.
Lynnelle S,Perth,Sep 2019,"Whilst we love this area for sunset drinks at our favourite beach bar, we feel the area in general is looking very run down. There was the work dome to build the big wall along the beach front but the road area and empty restaurants falling into ruin looks terrible. The corner of Arjuna and Blue Ocean beach road is an accident waiting to happen with rubble falling from the sidewalk onto the road and then the corner where the Sin Ken Ken is and Trattoria were are filthy and falling apart.The bougainvillea growing from the Sin Ken Ken is downright dangerous to walker by traffic.It appears somebody is paying staff to secure the property but no maintenance is being done and it is a ruin."
Hawks2008,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"Good beach - not nearly as crowded as the Legian beach to the south. Good lounges, expect to pay 100k Rupia for two. Lovely swimming"
Erica,33 contributions,Aug 2019,"The sunset is so beautiful , you can play on the beach with your friends and see a beautiful sunset , the beach is so clean!"
Vicki,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2019,A beautiful spot to watch the surf & the sun going down on a bean bag with beer or cocktail in hand . Soo relaxing & the best sunsets you will ever see  
KelsSydney_Australia,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2019,"Great spot for cocktails and watching the sun set. Great vibe for families, couples and all visitors to Bali. There are many bars to choose from and there are always locals flying their huge kites. Highly recommended "
stephen m,"Heywood, UK",Sep 2019,"lovely beach about 20 mins drive from Rama Residence but will take much longer to get back due to traffic, taxis very cheap if you use Bluebird but be careful with private hire they will ask for much more, so haggle.The beach is a surfers paradise and not for swimmers but still nice to visit. The beach hawkers will try to sell to you but all very pleasant.Also very safe to leave things  whilst away from sunbeds"
FFF22,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2019,"Sitting on beanbags watching the sunset with friends, Mojito & Satay while listening to some awesome music, choose your preference, lay back and enjoy!"
Tania C,28 contributions,Sep 2019,"This is a great beach and u can hire a great lounger and umbrella for only 100,000 rupi. The water is warm and the sand warm and smooth . It is perfect with a good book EXCEPT the hawkers wanting to sell u everything from food, artwork and sun glasses"
608trudyl,67 contributions,Sep 2019,"Quite a crowded place, though sand is not white but greyish instead, is still clean and fine.  Lots of surfers and tourist there.  Saw quite a few dogs there and they were really happy playing around.  Amount of tourists there sometimes makes you wait for a good photo shot, especially during sunset when the colour is so beautiful.  Plenty of bars and restaurants on beach.  Shallow waters and not much shells or sharp stones, so not a problem to stroll along the beach without footwear."
Neil G,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Aug 2019,It is getting harder to get to now with one way street but if you are staying in a hotel nearby then it is easily accessible by foot good beach to lay around on except if the wind is from the ocean side as then it get sandy and dirty quickly
Javi,"Tucson, AZ",Nov 2018,"Good food and nice view, especially for the sunset. They also have bands that play songs upon request at times."
bluehive,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2019,"The biggest beach I have ever seen. Just beautiful with flat shallow water. It's full of people and equally good for surfing and swimming. Safe for kids, and had got many sun tables. You can easily relax and unwind. Water is mud colored unlike Malesti beach that had movie like blue water. Overall a must visit beach in Seminyak. "
Katy D,45 contributions,Sep 2019,Very touristy and busy with lots of sellers asking for trade. Good place for some surf lessons. Lots of restaurants to choose from. Nice place to sit with a Bintang and watch the sun go down
shanbabyshan,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2019,This beach was about a 5 mins walk from our Villa De Liza! Clean beach with a fair bit of pretty decent beach bars! 
iayzit2,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2019,You can just cross the road which is not very wide and you are on the beach. Hotel exclusive beach site section is well looked after by the staff.
donmalcolm,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2019,"What better place to enjoy the sun, than from on a lounger under an umbrella on a magnificent white sandy beach.Surfers, sunbathers and people coming in going, mostly young and fit, a place to enjoy"
g_beresford,"Sorrento, Australia",Aug 2019,It is so nice to just lay on one the beach lounges watching the surf 🏄‍♀️ having a Bintang & etching the people going by. This is what Bali is all about!.
laidbackterritorian,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,"Definitely the place to chill, listen to some live music on a beanbag drinking a cold bintang / cocktail watching the sunset over the ocean...even buy a watch for $10 if you like 😂 sums up #balilife"
Robyn D,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"Lots of places to eat along the shore, went to breakfast twice there (blue 9 beach restaurant, which was on the double six beach). Rented three body boards for the day, the prices weren’t too bad! Able to rent a seat and umbrella as well. Waves were good, though a small riptide was found while out there. Be careful. Otherwise very safe to be in. Sand was rather hot in the sun, burnt my feet. I recommend this beach."
Bec Gildare,"South Perth, Australia",Aug 2019,"My first visit to Bali and chose this resort based on location and price.  Great value for money.  Friendly, clean and everything you need closeby."
m sena,3 contributions,Aug 2019,"plain beach with plain sea, nothing special at there. too much people, not comfort for chilling at all"
Roger-North,"Altrincham, UK",Aug 2019,"A beautiful beach well-served by lively restaurants and beach bars, with huge bean-bags to sit amongst the crowds of beach and sea lovers. Very popular amongst surfers and not bad for others wanting a bit of a swim and splash within the high-crowned waves. The beach is extremely clean. However, you have to jump-over two open-sewage streams coming out to sea from the land. This is not difficult in the drier seasons. Don't let your children play in this stream - surely the stench should ring an alarm bell amongst parents, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Well-worth a visit and can easily spend a good few hours soaking up the atmosphere and admiring the views passing through,"
Himanshu Jain,"Jaipur, India",May 2019,"Good time to visit at sunset, you can see very beautiful view of sunset, and beach is assailable very easily, you can't swim there."
Lyndamey,"Indented Head, Australia",Jul 2019,"Great place to watch sunset, with a drink, food and music. Suitable for families and couples. Love watching the stars and the planes coming into the airport."
Peppermaisy,"Ocean Grove, Australia",Jul 2019,"The colourful bean bags and umbrellas at sunset make this a wonderful beach to holiday near. However be careful swimming here, a young man  a tourist on his honeymoon)  drowned at this beach the week I was here. There are rips and the surf can get rough.  It’s a great beach to walk each morning and definitely the place to be for sunset ."
S p,5 contributions,Jul 2019,"I'm writing this to warn other travellers, this beach is extremely dangerous as it has very strong currents. It has killed many travellers including the death of my cousin only a few days ago while he was vacationing with his family. He was a very strong swimmer and had good athletic ability, but the rip tide was too strong and carried him away. I hope this message gets to as many people as possible, it's difficult to tell when the ocean current will come, so please be careful when swimming in this beach. You can do a search on the many swimmers deaths in this beach and you can find out what a rip tide current is. Thank you"
blackeldo,"Kiama, Australia",Jun 2019,"A NEW NAME AND APPEARANCE FOR AN OLD SPOT….­I first visited in the early 80s – stayed here in 2015 – and checked it out annually since.A NEW NAME - this 500m section of the 9km KUTA to CANGGU beach strip has only been referred to as DOUBLE SIX BEACH these past few years.Prior, it was simply that section where LEGIAN BCH changes to SEMINYAK BCH – abt 3km from the KUTA end. Makes sense: the huge DOUBLE SIX RESORT was not opened until AUG. ‘14.A NEW APPEARANCE – I used to cycle KUTA-CANGGU beach in the 80s. Back then, the busy hotel strip would start to peter out in LEGIAN – by the time I got to the D6 area there was nothing much in back of the beach – just the occasional resort accessed by tracks down from JL LEGIAN inland. How things have changed – continuous resorts now extend past D6 to north of SEMINYAK.So D6 BEACH has changed, but what is it like? Well it’s one of the more popular stretches of sand along this busy strip - because of GOOD ACCESS (Jalan  Arjuna hits the beach here from inland LEGIAN/STH SEMINYAK which have dozens of resorts covering all budgets - and the FABULOUS BEACH CLUBS with their on-sand soft cushions and little tables mentioned in many other reviews. The place is certainly attractive, with lotsa sunlounges for rent and those multi-coloured umbrellas. South of the beach clubs are a host of those local guys selling beer – buy from them and you get the plastic chair and table, usually an umbrella and are their friend for life. They often rent sunlounges, surfboards etcMY RATING Normally I would rate D6 Beach ABOVE AVERAGE but for one demerit – the open drain that runs below JL ARJUNA exits across the beach: dry season sees just a trickle but wet season can be a torrent.TIPS – wet season is not the best time to visit the whole extended beach – lotsa rubbish and storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).- those beach clubs: at least 3 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw the northern-most with at least 1000 people on the sand! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value but too many people for me – I went back to the beer guys.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems mid-range to high end. Dozens of places covering all budgets within a 10 min stroll inland via JL ARJUNA.- JL ARJUNA and others similarly have dozens of restaurants from sub-budget up. Wandering food halwkers on the sand can provide some inexpensive yummy stuff as does the guy doing roasted corn foot of ARJUNA.- no shortage of RETAIL THERAPY on ARJUNA and along JL LEGIAN 800M inland (latter has some of BALI’s better boutiques and furniture/art)- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.SUM UP – definitely worth a visit but overall no better than half a dozen other locations along the long extended beach"
Domlea,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2019,The beach and water was the cleanest I've ever seen. The beach is always full of life. It's easy to get a drink or a boogie board.
Peter A,"Somerville, Australia",Jul 2019,"Had dinner and drinks here while watching the sunset. Restaurant was on the beach and the food was delicious.  There are many to choose from. The view was exceptional watching the waves roll in and the sunset was beautiful.  We had the occasional seller walk past but gave them a smile and a no thanks so all was good. A great spot to relax, eat, drink and watch the world put on an amazing display. "
Kimmeikle1990,11 contributions,Jul 2019,Great to just chill out on the beach. Bargain your way to a good deal for a day bed and watch out for the lovely ladies selling items and wanting to braid your hair and rub your feet.
nomadic_heart7,"Bongaigaon, India",Jul 2019,"Apart from offering panoramic ocean and beach views, the vibes are pretty good in this beach.You can drink,chill,lazy around ,swim,surf and eat cheap local foods and spent the whole day without care.Must visit for a day to spend."
Michelle C,"Shanghai, China",Jul 2019,I would say it was a nice beach with plenty of options re. Beds and restaurants... some areas were not the most clean but largely in good condition.... felt safe as a solo sunbather... 
422iana,"Dunedin, New Zealand",Jul 2019,The usual as you get there you get asked if you need anything. Nice beach with a lot of surfers in the water.
richathome1,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2019,"A beautiful spot to kick back and relax. Hire a beach chair and umbrella by day then as the sunsets out come the beanbag sofas, cocktails and live music.Probably not the beach for a swim though, surfing is the option here."
The Stoddard,"Sonoma, CA",Jul 2019,"The beach super nice.... there is local food called “bakso gerobak biru” it is indonesian meatball soup with noodles and cabbage... it is delicious.. Eat it with the drink of ‘teh botol’ very good combination! Beach, bakso, teh botol... perfect 👌"
georgec5257,"Auckland, New Zealand",Jun 2019,"There are many, many beach bars where you can enjoy drinks and watch a great sunset. Best times are between 5.00pm and 8.00pm."
Sdhawan61,Noida,Jun 2019,"Was staying very close to 66 beach and went there couple of times. This is more for relaxing and have time for urself. There are many shacks and you can relax on one of these and grab some food, drinks. Good to go there in the evening around 430 5 PM and stay till 730- 8 PM "
Nikita S,6 contributions,Jul 2019,This beach has good waves for surfing. You can find instructors and equipment on the beach for decent price. I paid 200k idr for 2h lesson. Not very suitable for small children as the water is not calm.
catherine w,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Fantastic beach . Bali has really cleaned up its act and its beaches . From sunrise to sunset , the beach is there to be enjoyed . Lots of morning walkers , joggers , swimmers and surfers . During the day you can hire one or two sun lounges and umbrellas for a fee of around $10 for the day . Lots of hawkers but a firm no goes a long way if you dont want to be bothered , then again you may want to barter for a sarong , jewellery , statue , painting , kite , etc as its all fun on the beach . Drinks at sunset on the beach is always a fantastic experience and Sundays is especially crowded with Indonesian families and groups going to the beach to relax or have fun , maybe a game of soccer or a swim , or just a walk along the waters edge . A horse ride at sunrise or sunset is a good thing to do and even if you have never been on a horse before the very experienced stable guys are there to help you and walk a long side your horse so you have no worries of your horse galloping away . There are lots of beach bars from plastic seats on the beach to restaurants with bean bags , lanterns at night and entertainment from sunset . There really is something for everyone."
Dannie S,"Fremantle, Australia",Jun 2019,Beautiful place for casual drinks and eats. Love the lit up beach warungs and beanbags. Only downside is the people walking the beach selling items.
arzaqzidan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2019,This is definitely one of the must visit place during your stay in bali. It has a great view and calming wave. Great food and drinks (if you choose the right place). A bit crowded but it's the right amount of crowded. And you must see the sunset on this beach it's mesmerizing.
999marianne,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2019,Good beach to spend time at - rent an umbrella and sunbed from one of the locals (approx IDR 50k for 3 hours); many places for lunch close by and good swimming. The tide is strong  so would advise you to be careful if you're not a strong swimmer. Beach was super clean during my visit. Surfing lessons (and boards) available from local instructors.
Andrea G,"Leeds, UK",Jun 2019,Long beach with many beach bars of varying character and style. Perfect for walks and watching the sunset. When we visited it was very windy so the big waves did not make it possible for anyone to swim. However lots of interesting things to see and do
HugoColle,"Evergem, Belgium",May 2019,"A lovely beach but ofcourse watch out in the sea, theres a strong current and big waves. Ideal to surf thats for sure and alot of places offers you lessons for beginners. The sunset is wonderful, not really crowdy. There is live music in the evening at each bar or restaurant. "
Saurabh Mittal,"Ghaziabad, India",Jun 2019,"Very vibrant yet not very loud. Lots of eating options with comfy beds on the beach. Had a wonderful evening with live bands playing, great food and ever soothing sea breeze!!"
isabelleB120188,6 contributions,Jun 2019,Nice beach next to Kuta and before Canggu area. Definitely for sunsets. I like to watch the waves during daytime from beach bar.
Jolita,7 contributions,May 2019,"It is nice, clean and not overcrowded beach.You can rent sunbeds and umbrellas, have food at local caffee or just grab some drinks.You can swim , do surfing-you can take lessons and rent equipment on beach.We really had great time there.The sunset is amazing there."
tonyholmes61,"Forster, Australia",Jun 2019,Sunsets here are always the best Drinking cold Bintang at Froggies bar siting with great staff & the beach girls watching another great sunset Swim in the warm waters & watching a beautiful sunset is the best
rmalde88,"London, UK",Jun 2019,Lovely clean beach with soft sand. Clear water and big waves. Perfect for children/families. Very lovely in the evening with food restaurants live music and bean bags for people to sit and enjoy.
MLandM,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2019,"Most days are half a matter of shore break, not much more. The better days are one and a half metres of clean barrels about 40m off shore, clean and tidy and stretching for two hundred metres or so. The surf (not the beach) reminds me of Noosa barrels. Consistent and smooth.Pretty safe, not much rip, usually a south to north current. Sandy bottom, not rocky or dangerous. A good spot for beginners. Plenty of food and refreshments on the beach, also hire spots for boards, sun beds, etc. The on-beach pubs are good fun with live bands every night. A good place to chill. Fun will be had."
sparky268,"Childers, Australia",May 2019,"Great morning walk area and watch the locals setting up for the day, or go late in the day and join the huge crowds to watch the sunset. Lots of vendors and restaurants to choose from. Really colourful part of the beach, especially around the bars.Good for a chill evening out."
Rich,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2019,"Great to watch the sunset with a massive Mango Daiquiri, but be careful, they make em strong, have no more than 3 or you wont make it off the beach! Good food, pizza's a good choice. All the guys working there really friendly, and some good music played live, good spot"
Janet N,54 contributions,May 2019,"its just something everyone who travels to this part of bali needs to experience at least once. Join the throng of people that flock here to enjoy the sunset. If you're like me and dont go to Kuta this is the place to people watch, wander along the beach in the mornings, enjoy a sunset drink at La Plancha."
David Roy P,"Batemans Bay, Australia",May 2019,"Double Six Beach is a part of the Beach that starts at the Airport and curves along the coast for Miles , It is part of Seminyak and quite different to the Kuta Beach , It is quite wide and dotted with Umbrella's and Lounges and a number of Beach Clubs and Bars . There are a number of Traders selling their Wares , a Surf School and an area for Swimming between the Flags . The sand is not what I would call ""White"" but is quite fine & reasonably Clean (Unlike Kuta ) . The Water was quite warm and is quite clean . Also , certainly not crowded , plenty of room for all ."
bruce b,"Pommard, France",May 2019,one of the very best beach strips on the bali coast for evening sunsets and multi entertainment options
Cynthia,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2019,"The Beach was a place where you can see sunrise and sunset view, flying kite there is a good choice ! Relaxing in the beach with your coconut drink is a perfect moment !"
Ryan,"San Diego, CA",May 2019,"I’m from Cali so if I was comparing beaches, Seminyak feels like Huntington Beach or those in Santa Barbara but a bit warmer. Water color is the same, a dark green/blue. I was hoping for tortoise blue with white sandy beaches but it was still nice! The chairs with umbrellas is a must in the afternoon otherwise you’ll only last a short amount of time. Pay roughly 100-150k rupiah for the whole day for a pair. If it’s peak season with most filled, it’ll probably be more. "
Erwin,"Ede, The Netherlands",May 2019,"During the day it's pretty quiet on this beach. For surfing, it would be wiser to go to Kuta beach. The waves there are overal better than here. When the sun sets, the bars on this beach start live music. Good for a chill evening out."
Aaqarsh Aiyyar,"Chennai (Madras), India",Mar 2019,The sand and the waters were clean. The beach is popular for water sports. I relaxed in an evening in this beach and it was a good experience.
putrisabatina,"Bandung, Jawa Barat, Indonesia",May 2019,"I like it pretty clean, tourists are great, bikinis are everywhere (it makes you not afraid to wear it!), some dogs walking, barking, playing around, make the beach so lovely."
rellie56,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2019,a lot more needs to be done in regard to rubbish the bars clean there own area but not waters edge used nappies general rubbish still litter beach
Ruth Q,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,"Lots of cafes, bars, surf schools and music along this stretch of beach. Water and sand were clean. Beaches were well patrolled with plenty of life guards."
Frank G,"West Pennant Hills, Australia",Apr 2019,Walked along this beach once - refused to go back. The beach and the water are full of every type of rubbish you can think of - from plastics and bottles to sewerage waste.  I have no idea how the lifesavers actually swim in it - I consider it an extreme health hazard..
NIC D,France,May 2019,"nice clean beach , easy access, you can have a surf lesson or just rent un umbrella  with deck chair ; you can bathe in the sea ,difficult to swim becaufe of the waves ,but great fun!"
Edgar,35 contributions,May 2019,"Nice flat beach for swimming, great vibe. Lots of beach bars and restaurants to choose from. Surf schools around to learn surfing. Live music at sunset at almost all bars, great sunsets but it gets kinda crowded before sunset. All in all a safe beach with lots of options around."
Jason M,8 contributions,May 2019,"Becomes repetitive after a bit but nice, a Floridian here so not mind blowing in any way but nice. Especially when considering its in addition to the surrounding night life partying and day life cultural exploration."
Rajeebg,"Pune, India",May 2019,"Titled Double Six as its majorly privately owned. Beach is partly owed up on space by quite a few of the Nearby hotels to entertain their own guests, looks beautiful in most seasons, despite the heat. Clean n Tidy !!"
Terry Mccarty,4 contributions,May 2019,"We went there for dinner and were not dissapointed even some people said its dirty, no it was very clean and we truly enjoyed our time on Double six beach Seminyak."
Natasha Elizabeth,"Halls Creek, Australia",Apr 2019,We spent a week here and enjoyed every day.  My partner surfed while I lay on the beach chairs.  The people are so lovely and it was so relaxing. Great restaurants and ice cold Bintang!
JannieLiu1985,5 contributions,May 2019,"Nice to chill here. Evening time we spent in La Planca cafe,cool music and nice vibe. If you want to swim its not the best option."
WilsonWarner89,"Arvada, CO",Apr 2019,"My wife and i love spending time outdoors here, but it gets really hot really fast, so you need to make sure that you find some shade where you can stash your stuff and relax after your trips into the water. We both loved trying to surf for the first time!"
Cuneyt O,2 contributions,Dec 2018,"We stayed at double six hotel and spent the day time on the beach in front. Very relaxing location. Sea has lot of waves, not for swimming like Mediterranean but good for surfers."
Kartika D,"Kuta, Indonesia",Apr 2019,"On the Double Six beach, Seminyak Bali.This afternoon I sat alone, enjoying a bowl of meatballs and a bottle of Radler.Looking from a distance the surfers are playing with the waves.I want to be like them, when it's bored, it can release the burden on the sea.Thank you God for this beautiful sea, your sunset, I can enjoy it."
JenTravels123,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2018,"Amazing staff, food, cocktails. Love this place. Clean and modern. Back soon for another dose of Coccoon."
Eduardo De La Calle,8 contributions,Apr 2019,"For your fist time in Bali I hope you will never come to his place, is not really bad but the vibes are quite doggy..."
buddyrogers32,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2019,This beach is easily accessible In the morning light waves break on a regular pattern - mostly clean water and beach is cleaned each morning Occasionally ocean water can be littered with rubbish if a storm has taken place previous evening and ends up washing waste into ocean which is not ideal 
Alvilde P,World,Apr 2019,The beach is clean. The only clean beach i have been to in Bali. Nice bars. Good food. Good for party. 
topps,12 contributions,Mar 2019,"We stayed at the double six hotel, so it was easy to walk over to the lovely clean beach, they have their own beach area with deckchairs, towels etc, easy to go for a swim and not worry about your belongings, the beach is cleaned each morning, so a lovely walk after breakfast..along the beach. a great place."
TaherAlbaghliJulian,"Kuwait City, Kuwait",Mar 2019,I stayed 4 days in Double Six hotel and I used to visit Double Six Beach after the breakfast when I was there.It clean beach  and it great place to surf or learing surf. Thebad thing about this beach it is not good for swimming  because high waves.
dmacThurgoona,"Benalla, Australia",Mar 2019,"We spent 14 days near to Double Six Beach, and it was a beautiful clean beach , with many restaurants and shopping nearby."
Alan R,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Mar 2019,"Early morning the re can be some good fun waves to be had here before the wind picks up. There are always plenty of beach chairs and easy to get a cold drink. The sunsets here are amazing, and there are so many choices to find a table, a bean bag and enjoy the good food and drinks"
Martha B,7 contributions,Mar 2019,"We love that beach for sunsets. You should try to come by 6 PM, find nice cafe with live music band and enjoy sunset time with your lovely ones."
badgranma,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2019,"We made a quick visit this visit as the weather wasn't on our side.  The beach was great, but the water was a little dirty.  We don't swim, but felt it wasn't worth putting our feet in this time."
Dan,5 contributions,Mar 2019,There are less vendors at this part of the beach you will pay a little more for you sunbeds but its well worth it if you dont want to be hassled. 
vicki y,32 contributions,Mar 2019,Situated between Ubud and Sukawati this place was a pleasant surprise. The setting is very romantic and just beautiful. The service was great and the food even better. Enjoyed this place very much.It is also vary close to Bali zoo.Have a great day. 😁
leanneandtony,"Cairns, Australia",Mar 2019,Is is just another Bali beach. It is fine for a swim and relax under an umbrella.The beach gets cleaned of rubbish every morning and it is patrolled with lifesavers.The hawkers are there but not as bad as kuta. U can hire to sunlounges and an umbrella for 100000 for the day. Beers are cheap 26000 and there are surf schools and board hire.It’s fine for a typical Bali beach.
Jean L,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2019,You will be approached for beach chair/umbrella rentals. Rates are for the whole day. Feel free to agree on a price depending on how long you'll be spending there. It can get hot so it's better to go earlier in the day or later in the evening. Surf  lessons are available and boards can be rented as well!
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Mar 2019,Probably the best best in Bali for something to do.Plenty of beachside bars and restaurants that offer up seating and tables.Great place to chill with your favourite beverage whilst watching the sunset.Always a heap of activity happening here.
bellaelisabet,20 contributions,Mar 2019,Its really nice beach to spent time with husband and kid...we love laying on sand while looks kid playing in the sea
boycie13,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2019,I really like this beach it such a nice place and has everything bars along a stretch lots of places to get sun loungers. Surf board hire places with the guys doing lessons and usually selling an assortment of drinks and all I’ve had contact with a really friendly. Lots of life guards. My only small annoyance is the amount of people walking up and down selling an assortment of crap whilst it’s fun at first can become a bit annoying when you just want to chill and be left alone. But still a cracking place
Hans v,"Goes, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"I.would have prefeered 3,5 stars: sitting here enjoying a cold beer watching the sunset definitely 4 maybe even more stars, the plastic and other rubbish 2 - 2,5 stars. The fact that over the past years more and more effort is being made to clean up swings the score."
Bas F,"Roosendaal, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,It is so nice to be at this beach. The sea offers you nice wa  bes and good swimming.  Lots of bars and restaurants. At sunset you have a very nice sight to watch the sun going under.
Lynette F,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2018,"Great spot to visit and soak up the ambience that is unique to Bali. Friendly service, usually we split a large Bintang bottle of beer which generally costs around $5 but here, like many other tourist bars, only small Bintangs are served, for about $4 each. Still good value, and still good beer, plus good service completes the hat trick."
Jess W,"Ballarat, Australia",Feb 2019,"We chose to meet a minimum spend and sit in an alcove area to the right, after a pre booked party left we moved to the round almost floating area which was as good as it looks in the photos. The food was delicious and drinks menu wide ranging. We would return. "
Robert O,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2019,"Double six is between Legian and Seminyak beaches. The road behind the beach is open for motorized traffic which means convenient access for people who want to take it easy. There are many restaurants and bars with (loud) live Western style music right on the beach, offering luxury seating and cold beer. At the end of the afternoon it can get crowded as people come to see the sunset. Moreover it is not as hot as during the day.This beach is not a place for peace and quiet seekers."
Alexlostinparadise,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2019,"instead of going to alot of pricey beachclubs, double 6 beach offers a cheap but hipster solution to catching a good sunset with the many cheap beach bars. theres a famous bakso place there which everyone says its good but i havent tried it"
ronan233,33 contributions,Feb 2019,Go there at 5-6 when it’s little cool you can seat and drink . Very nice beach. Enjoy the sunset .Not overcrowded . 
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Jan 2019,"I arrived at double six beach and to my surprise , nothing had changed since my last visit except more plastic. The whole section of beaches from the airport up the coast all have that same horrible trademark - polluted dirty beaches. Shame."
borborbet,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2019,Nice area of the beach with lots of different options for banana lounges and bar options. Much cleaner area than other parts of the beach in Seminyak
Mike G,26 contributions,Jan 2019,"Went for a morning run on double six beach - endless plastic! So sad. As lovely as the Balinese are, they need to take this plastic problem seriously. Is much worse than the pic shows. "
Eldin Sal E,"Paris, France",Dec 2018,Not for swimming ...but many activities ..can have dinner on the beach in the evening ...with many choices .prices ok
teachsyd95,5 contributions,Jan 2019,The water was warm and definitely felt tropical. The issue was the garbage wrapping around your ankles and neck when swimming. Definitely wouldn't recommend opening your mouth underwater.
Jamie F,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Jan 2019,"Spectacular sunsets, cheap (although not always quality) drinks and some tunes of most of the popular covers.Beanbags are great, hagglers can be a touch annoying interrupting conversation but the sunset makes it all worth it.Not a good beach for inexperienced swimmers, vicious shorebreak and often a nasty rip or two- be careful!But the sunset is special and this is a Bali must do"
Mic_Duran,"Manila, Philippines",Jan 2019,"Spend couple hours here with some of my balinese friend such a good idea. Lucky for us, because we still got sunset even rainy season in Indonesia. But it was sunny when we were there."
Pri,2 contributions,Dec 2018,"Beach was not crowded when we went during December 2018. However, the shower facilities after beach activities were not good. There was an old lady who can't speak English for the shower. We faced  lots of problems in having shower there. She can't explain things well."
haqsta,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2019,"Coming from Oz, where we have so many glorious and clean beaches, many f Bali's beaches don't shine by comparison. Also compared to the clean beaches at Nusa Dua Seminyak falls short. At least the sand is raked every daya nd there is a real community vibe at sunset with many walkers with their dogs (yes as pets!!). The beach bars are not as glam as further up the beach with the immediate options feeling a bit dirty"
wayne j,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2019,"Looked forward to our walk down Double Six for the first time in ten years but after less than 10 minutes, decided to give it up because of the rubbish and pollution! So sad! What makes it worse, a couple of fires on the sand lit by the locals trying to dispose of what they can! Please visitors to Double Six...say no to plastic bags, straws and disposable cups. Only buy if you can just one BIG water bottle not 5 or six little ones each day and make sure you dont add to the problem!    "
Detritus,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,The beach itself was really good. But it was very crowded.  We easily managed to get beers and chairs set up for us and then just sat back and enjoyed ourselves.There are so many places to eat along the side of the roads and we did try one of them.Getting there took a while due to traffic.
thelonious22,Seongnam,Dec 2018,Double Six Beach few kilometers south was more of the same but with more restaurants and hotels along it offering comfortable seating for payment.  Plenty of surfing instructors were available for those who were brave enough to take a dip in the filthy looking water.
laila,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2018,"There's a lot of rubbish in the water and along the beach unfortunately. You also get approached a lot to purchase street items, for massages and temporary tattoos. Not very relaxing and probably wouldn't go back in the future."
Fckdabck,8 contributions,Jan 2019,"Horrible... Plastic bags and trash everywhere on the beach, am I in Mumbai?The locals do not look after their beach and the results show. Very disappointing. Go further north for better beaches."
E9837BUjohnl,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Dec 2018,Amazing on the beach. drinks are perfect and the view is spectacular as well as the food. Great service 
Rory James DOYLE,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2018,TA well rated Double Six Beach has plastic rubbish everywhere. Unbelieveable for a location that depends on tourism. Must be more regular rubbish collection and maintenance.
mav68,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2018,"I stayed at one of the new boutique hotel in Seminyak, obviously hit to the beach is one of the 'must do'. I was very disappointed with the condition of the beach. If it is a 3rd world countries with no international brand presence, I can probably able to accept as I have been to other rural beach area within Indonesia, the 'green effort',  'waste management' and 'CSR' are almost unheard.This is Bali, it appears in the touristy world map.It seems no one bothers, but it does bothers me as a tourist. I have been to Bali easily 25 times in my life, this is the worst I have seen in Bali beaches.Shame to the authority as no good effort has been put in!Shame to the local establishment. Are they not conscious of it at all?Shame to the tourist, if any of tourist has contributed to this mess!Shame to the local, as I has seen many of them are the culprit of litteringShame to the international organisations on the island. Where is their CSR? Helping the poor and unfortunate are important,  but if the fundamentals of cleanliness are not been taking care of, tourism will suffer and the ripple effect can be drastic. I am disappointed. "
Caroline C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2018,"Visitors can enjoy beach and sunset. But too bad the beach is really dirty and lots of garbage (plastic bottle, food packages, etc). Really uncomfortable and sad to see. I hope visitors who came here will take care of the environment and please bring along your garbage and throw in the trash can. If not us, then who ?You can see people sit down and enjoy the sunset. Also some people playing soccer. Enjoy the day."
Lynda Brookes,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2018,What a day at the best beach in Bali. From the friendly surfing teachers to the perfect waves. The atmosphere here is why we came back day after day. 
Juraj,3 contributions,Dec 2018,"We went to Double Six beach yesterday. It is a part of Seminyak beaches and it is ridiculously amazing. Soft sand, no stones or other little pebbles, great waves, that is why everyone is surfing. There were literally five people on the beach ever since morning. It gets a little crowded in the afternoon as everyone gathers to see the most beautiful sunset you will ever see. People who sell you stuff are frequent but a simple No for two-three times will send them on their way and I do not see it as a big problem."
Jarrod M,"Cape Town, South Africa",Nov 2018,"The beach is warm and a great place to surf.  One of my regrets is not taking up the offer of learning to surf.Be ready to be hounded about renting a chair or umbrella or learning how to swim.  The local Balinese are doing their best to make a living wherever possible.  Just be friendly and decline if you're not keen, they will respect your decision."
Jaster N,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2018,"Crowded beach, nothing special apart from people trying to sell you things and rent you daybed for 100,000k. If you are looking for nice quiet beach, go to Uluwatu instead! This is a touristy beach."
Emma,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2018,"I truly hated Double Six Beach! I have travelled through a number of countries where it's normal to approach passerby's offering goods, and it's never bothered me- i usually enjoy the new experience. But here, it was impossible to walk more than 2 metres down the beach without being hassled to buy sunglasses, shoes etc. We left after five minutes after we got sick of people following us down the beach and one man literally grabbing my partner's arm to try to force him to buy things. Also beware of people trying to scam you into timeshares!"
Black Jack,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2018,"If you are in Bali just visit Double Six Beach at wee hours and you will find this is perfect destination you will remember all life long. As the sun sets the moods sets in, the band plays and couch listeners sipping ginger ale and bintang will soothe the body and mind. There will be some street peddlers peddling all laser gizmos kites and boomerangs. In the morning the white sands and surfing lessons from lifeguards for 300000 an hour is all that you need to live Bali experience at Double Six Beach. You can collect all kinds of conches, corals and most importantly the starfish shells amazing. Relax and have bintang at the restaurants and couches lining the beach from Seminyak Beach to Double Six all the way to Kuta Beach and Beyond. Don't forget to aim the arrow peddled by street hawker at the black pirate kite flying above the white sands. Don't hurt anybody or you will lose your ""License"". My perfect shot was awesome and everyone was gasped as it landed behind the bikini clad lady at double arm's length. ""Do not try this trick at beach"". Disclaimer #BlackJackRapport"
Ron P,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2018,"This beach is the perfect venue for visitors or locals who have guests visiting.  There are countless eateries and you can catch some of the best sunsets you will ever see on those special evening when the clouds, haze, and sun are all just right."
Suzy,2 contributions,Sep 2018,"so many amazing restaurants esp blue 9, lots of shops. we spent 2 nights at this beach. we loved it so much. "
B4962OAbarbaram,Merino,Nov 2018,Wonderful place to see the sunset and have dinner afterwards.  Great food at many of the restaurants.
Jayelle62,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2018,"The beach at double six is not a place to relax, although the sunset here is pretty. (Provided there are no clouds in the pm) but be prepared to be hassled by peddlers trying to sell you sarongs, watches, paintings, kites & jewellery. This might be acceptable if it were only a few of them, but the days I went to double six I was hassled every five minutes by so many of them it became very annoying. I hired a sun lounge, to relax but every few minutes a peddler came. They do not care for your peace & quiet. Even when you say no, the lady peddlers grab your feet and say “foot massage ?” Several times despite you declining. No personal boundaries. You have to be rude to get them to leave. So for 2 hours I hired a lounge and had no break from them. I don’t think they understand how many of them come at you. It’s too much !!! Even when you go to the beach cafes at double six they are allowed in the restaurant while your eating .....to hassle you to buy. Even when your about to take a mouthful of food they come right up. I was trying to be polite ,but it was just too much for me to enjoy my time there.  The food is very average, but the sunsets are lovely. The ocean isn’t always clean and some plastic and packaging floated past as I swam. There are many surf schools at double six beach but no designated area for them so wherever you swim be prepared for learner surfers to come crashing toward you. Ha ha . Better to go to less popular beaches. Or better still the islands are much nicer. "
adarshjalan,"Kolkata (Calcutta), India",Oct 2018,there place was just 5 min from our SEMINYAK villa.  the place is well maintained. u get a delectable view of flights landing and taking off. lot of options in drinks and finger food . hire an umbrella with a few beach beds  and enjoy your drinks. 
Gill Smith,30 contributions,Jul 2018,What an amazing beach.night time is beautiful and spectacular with music bars food bean bags on beach. Loved it
Ross H,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2018,A lovely beach just walking distance from the Double Six and other reports.  Plenty to see and do along this stretch of coast.
Grace M,5 contributions,Oct 2018,I thought this beach is beautiful. Especially as the sun going down. You are be able to enjoy the spectacles while relaxing in one of many bars which spread out along the beach. After the sun goes down then the music start up with lots of the bars having live bands. It's worth noting that the traffic around here can get very heavy so it can be worth travelling quarter a mile on foot.
Dr. Ayan Das,"Howrah, India",Oct 2018,"Double Six beach is just 10min drive from the Hotel Terrace At Kuta or from legian beach, it's clean and little less crowded than legain and kuta. Sunbeds are quite expensive here as local people are getting more payment from wealthy European people. Otherwise it's nice and Clean but expensive and second best Compare with Nusa Dua beach "
surfoz,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2018,"Although it looked nice and the ocean blue and inviting, there was rubbish strewn along the shore line. The beach is cleaned each day but what a losing battle it is. The dark grey sand is very hot and you will need to run from the street or your deck chair to the water.I did have a swim and tried my best not to touch and floating debris. Nothing like a garbage bag or two wrapping around your legs while swimming.We walked each morning and my wife picked up glass as we did, of course we wore footwear."
Aloysius170,"Sumba, Indonesia",Aug 2018,This black sandy beach is frequented by the youth because they know this area as a 66 club area for night drink and music outing.  But careful undercurrents can be very strong here
Akbar_wibi,"Medan, Indonesia",Oct 2018,At a quick glance its not as busy as the Kuta Beach. It has a relaxing/chill vibe to it. The beach is beautiful & clean. There are also boards to hire for those who is interested. And dont miss the sunset.
lynnel58,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,This beach is always busy along the road. The surf is very rough so not really suitable for swimming l was there in July and no one was swimming and beach was closed but it could have been a result of the earthquake.
David,"Prague, Czech Republic",May 2018,"Perhaps we were just unlucky, but the beach and shallow water were covered with litter, mostly plastic bags wrapping your legs when walking in the sea... locals told us it is garbage from Java island coming with a torrent every now and then. But that made our stay just crap. We had to drive to east coast instead."
Mark B,"Braintree, UK",Sep 2018,"The beach has a fantastic vibe about it, days for relaxing and surfing. Night for a meal and chilling listening to the live music. Finally the sunsets are Awesome and to see so many people watching 🌞"
spikethebudgie2013,"Emsworth, UK",Oct 2018,"Loads to do and very tidy beach, lots of bars and restaurants.  Surf lessons by seminyaks local legend."
Garry B,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2018,"But heading from hotel to KDT, so had a walk along the beach, amazing sunset, end of the day so not many people around."
Rachel R,"Hahndorf, Australia",Sep 2018,"Warm and inviting, great small waves for beginner surfing. Clear and clean. Loved the water, sand is ok"
Hennie P,"Alberton, South Africa",Sep 2018,"We got to the Seminyak Double Six neach at about 9:00am and as this was in September, there were not tpo much people around....or so I thought.It soon started getting busy enough, fortunately this is a ""forgiving"" beach with enough space.Well appointed beach umbrellas and deck chairs to support a lazy day.Nice water with waves enough for the odd board and body surfing.Cold beers and frech coconot is a waive away......so, what can one say.There are the odd vendor about selling ""Bintang Beer"" towels and also shawls.Not in the shopping mood, then back and neck massages are offered as alternatives.All in all a fun day right up to sunset!"
Kendell E,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2018,"I have been visiting this beach for years. It’s my favourite. Ozzie’s Bar is the best. He supplies buxkets with your daybed to rinse your feet after a swim. He and his staff offer great service and now mix cocktails as well. The beach sellers are very friendly, but not too pushy."
Loreyse A,5 contributions,Oct 2018,"Sitting watching the sunset from plastic chairs, drinking Bintang, as supplied by Made, at the southern end of the beach - near Noku Beach house. Watching and joining in the Sunday Soccer matches for People's Day (Sunday), the game ends when the sun is set. Pizza party on the last night, delivered to the beach, super fun!!!"
Pink P,Florida,Sep 2018,"A bit disappointing to be honest.  The sea was very rough with a very strong current pulling us back out.  The sand just looks dirty, although I understand that's because it's partly volcanic - but it just looks grey.  And with the metal particles in it, it was blisteringly hot - impossible to walk on without sandals.  There were the usual vendors hawking sunglasses, kites and string/bead ""jewelry"".  Definitely not the typical tropical beach I was expecting - those seem to be on the East side of the island."
Edith NB,"Veracruz, Mexico",Sep 2018,"I’d definitely recommend to wait for the sunset in this beach. Also, there are many places to enjoy near to it. "
Vinay S,"Mumbai, India",Sep 2018,"Double Six Beach is basically a twin brother of Seminyak Beach. They are so identical and close that if you walk a bit from Seminyak to the left, you won't even realise when you have arrived at Double Six, and vice versa. "
Denise B,"Auckland, New Zealand",Aug 2018,"Nice waterfront location, good paths to stroll along and soak up the busy atmosphere. Heaps of eating places catering to all needs, good vibes, lots of music in the evenings, very pretty all lit up, great happy hours!"
lozz c,2 contributions,Sep 2018,"Nice to sit and have a drink, but a lot of plastic on the beach and in the water. Can get a bit noisey at times. Lots of bars and good eateries around."
Christopher M,5 contributions,Aug 2018,"A full on beach for entertainment, bars, cafes, live music & djs' great sunset views and comfy bean bags for a Bintang or four!!"
sharron132017,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2018,Visited every day while in Seminyak.Love sitting on the beach having a drink  under an umbrella or on beach lounge.Also great cafes with good food.
Monika D,"London, UK",Apr 2018,"Double Six Beach is a popular place in Seminyak. I was a bit disappointed when we arrived because there was a lot of plastic waste on the beach and in the water as well. Later we found out it was because of a storm 2 days ago, the waves brought the garbage out from the deeper places of the ocean. The next day the plastic was gone so we could start to enjoy our holiday. The beach has a good atmosphere overall with lots of beach bars/restaurant with live music every evening. The food is nice in every restaurant and cheap. Is a nice beach for surfer with some good waves but for people who are looking for more relaxing holiday I would recommend different beaches: Nusa Dua, the beaches on Gili Islands (with white sandy beach+turquoise water,perfect for snorkelling)"
Tony G,"Winchester, UK",Aug 2018,"Great place to chill out, have a few bintangs, and watch the sunset. Plenty to do and some great beach front bars."
Slldcl,"Sydney, Australia",May 2018,"Fabulous hotel that makes you feel like a Queen or King. Soo luxurious great views, amazing breakfasts plus delicious dinners."
Susana A,"Viseu, Portugal",Aug 2018,"Amazing place, great food, very nice staff. An amazing spot to spend a full day at the beach relaxing and doing some water sports."
p4pranjal,"Surat, India",Aug 2018,"A very good beach. Clean. Nice sunset view. This beach is not recommended for swimming. The water current is high. Good place to spend time. Local beer, coconut and food available."
msb444,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2018,"The beach is black sand and more of a surfing beach.  Not good for swimming, snorkeling or for small kids as the current is strong and the waves are big.  If you like to sunbathe, the shore is spacious and kept clean.  Nice for walking casually along the shoreline or even jogging."
bcheong,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2018,"Stayed at the indigo and this is the public beach that several hotels in the area share. Not too crowded but still lively enough. About $20 per sunbed per day, half day rates available. Plenty of restaurants and cafes "
Adrianus H,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2018,"First time to be here, the beach is beautiful with mid wave/tide and soft and clean sands. There were lot of cafe providing seats facing the beach. It’s free access to the beach, some hotels even giving free shuttle services to visit here."
lordmair,london,Jul 2018,"This is a very nice stretch of beach where the waves are a lot less fierce and hence very good area to learn body surfing or actual surfing.  Some quite nice restaurants like Gado Gado and La Plancha along the back, and generally a relaxed vibe."
WestAussiechick7,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018,"Visiting Double Six will definitely not be boring!If people aren't trying to sell you paintings, beer, watches,kids toys, sarongs, necklaces ... the list goes on,  then you can learn to surf or have a drink and some cheap bites at one of the bean bag beach bars!These bars are a place you MUST visit at sunset when in Bali. The beers are cheap and the live music creates a fun but relaxed atmosphere"
863rods,"Newcastle, Australia",Aug 2018,The surf at this beach is often rough with large dumping waves. However many people enjoy just sitting on the beach drinking bintangs.
Brookfield G,"Churchdown, UK",Aug 2018,"This beach is a fun spot to watch sunset ,lots of colourful bars and although there is some plastic rubbish at least Doyble Six seem to be trying to get on top of the litter unlike Kuta "
Richard H,"Hemel Hempstead, UK",Sep 2017,Can get very busy. Beachside restaurant served excellent food. Great way to watch the sun setting at the close of another fantastic day in Bali. Nice beach but as with a lot of beaches in Bali there is a lot of litter around. Great for a family day out and worth the visit. 
khanhninge,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2018,"I have stayed at Double Six Hotel, Anatara and The Haven and always drawn back to this beach for it vibrant atmosphere, good surf and clean. Great location for shopping and good restaurants."
cassie l,"London, UK",May 2018,"Me and my partner stayed at the double six hotel for 10 nights, we couldn't recommend this hotel enough! We loved the Hermes toiletries which was provided in the room and the butler ironing your clothes each evening. The breakfast was best we've ever had staying at hotel and had plenty of healthy options. The steak restaurant was out of this world would defiantly recommend. The staff was really friendly and would do anything to assist."
DrMedhat,KSA,Jul 2018,public open free beach. good for surfing or observing the sunset.alawys crowded. Not suitable for swimming.
Max C,"Phillip Island, Australia",Aug 2018,"Popular for viewing the sunset with tourists. Somewhat dirty beach, although the and is black, it is the continual rubbish washing up each day that is putrid.  It is cleaned daily, and I think this beach supplies much of the plastic we find in our oceans!  Many bars are also present, this is a classic Bali beach. Enjoy but be aware! "
Δημητριος Μ,"Corinth, Greece",Aug 2018,We are from Greece and we are really habitual in other kind of beaches.I don t like it so much. Is good only for serfers. It s not suitable for children. 
Ingrid T,12 contributions,Jul 2018,Great beach for a swim or to sit and soak up the atmosphere. It is popular for surfing lessons and kite flying. Be prepared to be approached by hawkers selling their wares. Great place to sit and have a drink or a take a beach walk to Kuta or Seminyak or watch the kite flying or surfing lessons take place.
denisevv20,"Birmingham, UK",Jul 2018,"the beach is busy with sun beds, umbrellas and vendors. we enjoy looking at the big waves and surfers riding the waves is also good for beginners they have many surf schools in the beach you can choose from,  very nice to stay for the sunset when they change the atmosphere and set all the colorful beanbags and umbrellas music and ights with cocktails, we enjoyed. "
Gwen A,17 contributions,Aug 2018,This is a surf beach so no really my thing.But it is lovely. Lots of bars along the beach and Double Six serves its clients well here. Very close to the hotel amd easily accessible.
177graemes,Salamanderbay,Jul 2018,"if you like people watching this is the place for you. Watching the sunset from your beanbag on the beach is a must at Double 6 Beach. The beanbags are cheap to hire, you can buy drinks and food and have in your beanbag. The beach is clean. The locals selling their wares are good fun to barter with.watch the incoming tide though! Need to get there early to get a good seat."
Sanjeev Ohri,"New Delhi, India",Jul 2018,loved the place. best place to go with kids and even solo as this place have good eateries and the beach is very clean
AriefLatif,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,"Good beach to hang out and learn to surf.  Lots of street vendors, must pay for lounging chairs but very affordable.  Waves is good for beginner. No lifeguard was seen so be mindful of unattended kids."
sjreviewer,"West Berlin, NJ",Jul 2018,"Unlike the famed Jersey shore, the sand on this beach is not burning hot. You can rent umbrellas and chairs every few feet for 5-15$. There are dozens of bars and a lot of interesting Australians and Englishmen to talk to. The only downside is that you are approached several times an hour from people trying to sell you anything from popsicles to sunglasses, to bracelets, to kites, to toys, to saris. The waves were great and there were many places to get surfing lessons."
virtueleighanne,"Hamilton, New Zealand",Jul 2018,Another experience viewing the sunset on the beach along with hundreds of others. Great setup with beanbags and umbrellas and food service .Staff were excellent and friendly. Enjoyed the hawkers selling their wares. A job not for the faint hearted ! Very friendly and tireless in their objectives.
Sk M,8 contributions,May 2018,This is one of the beutiful beaches situated in seminyak of bali. You can find some luxurious hotels nearby the beach with the beach view.Best time to visit is during sunset.And after that just chill out at the restaurants fully lighted on the beach shore with pleasent music.
harris0nes,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2018,Nice sunsets. Plenty of beach chairs to hire. Unfortunately the wave are strong at the moment and be careful!
Dianne,"Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam",Jul 2018,"Great to hang out at but there are A LOT of vendors that repeatedly came up to us, over and over again, even after we said no thank you. The water was pretty rough and we had to move our chairs but overall we had a relaxing time sitting on the beach for a reasonable price. "
josephine,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2018,beautiful beachlooking at the beauty of the beach while enjoying pure coconutand see new surfers learning surfing
Carole M,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2018,"The beach is lovely and clean  , soft gentle waves makes it ideal for first time surfers. Hire a surf board or a boogie board at a very inexpensive rate , have one of the happy go lucky Balinese boys show you how . As the sun sets stroll on the beach and relax while having a Bintan...."
Rusky6,"Shepparton, Australia",Jul 2018,Head to Mose for great service if you want a surfing lesson or want to hire a board. The guys here are great. My 10 year old son and I did a lesson and were catching waves in no time. We came back the next day as well. We came back a third time but the waves were pretty big and the conditions not ideal for my son so they said to us that it probably wasn't the safest day for him to surf. This was much appreciated as they could have quite easily taken our money and we would have been none the wiser. You'll find them on the beach just next to the Haven beach chairs. Well worth it.
Jyu005,"Tokyo, Japan",Jul 2018,Went there with my girlfriend and spend a couple of hours here. Local people are so friendly and they offered some stuff with reasonable price. Worth to visit.
Sameer P,"Ulm, Germany",Jun 2018,It’s been a fun evenings in double six beach. I love the restaurants with bands and fire dancers are awesomes. Drinks beers or full bottle drinks as they dilute your drinks with water.
Jashy80,"Volendam, The Netherlands",Jun 2018,"On our honeymoon in June/July '18 my wife and I stayed at Double Six Beach, being a surfer I checked out various surf schools along the beach and after a great talk with Wayan, me and my wife booked a private session at his surf school. My girl got great guidance and was standing up in the first hour, big smile on her face!Being more experienced, I got great instructions on improving my form and technique, I've been back for more the whole vacation. Next to having a solid team, good guidance, Wayan is an amiable guy with great knowledge on surfing, the island and Bali culture.When you visit Seminyak, even if you have never surfed before, I can highly recommend Wayan for a splendid time on the water!"
Frank J,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2018,Nice and clean beach with surfing and surfing schools available.  Plenty of the usual coffee shops and day spas available
Lizelle S,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Jun 2018,"It's great for beautiful sunset pictures,  but I hated the atmosphere.  Each restaurant places different music and want play their music louder than the next one. So way to much sounds and people. If your a party animal, then I'm sure you'd enjoy the nights there, but it's definitely not a relaxing beach."
Paige L,"Croydon, UK",Jun 2018,"After reading some of the reviews on here I wanted to write my own purely to point out how lovely this beach is. Yes it is crowded but the beach is huge and we had an amazing time. We first went for the sunset, beautiful atmosphere. My partner clearly thought so as he proposed whilst there. We came back the following day and spent the day there, the sea is for surfing (not for swimming really) my partner done a surfing lesson and enjoyed that and we rented out 2 sunbeds and an umbrella for 4 hours. This was ideal really. I would highly recommend visiting the beach.  "
Lara V,"Cape Town Central, South Africa",Jun 2018,"Stunning views, lots of restaurants to choose from, the ocean is warm and gentle. At night it turns into an outside feast for the eyes, everyone is sitting on the beach front drinking cocktails listening to music and watching the fireworks :-) Loved it!"
Erich H,"Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia",Jun 2018,"Came here with my family (3 adults, 4 children ages 7, 6, 4, & 1) almost every day of our 9 day stay in Bali and we didn't stay in this area.  We came here our first day on a recommendation from a friend and decided to come every day after that.  The beach is clean and has great water for kids and adults alike.  We were able to rent surfboards and beach chairs cheap every day.  My wife and I had visited some other beaches during the afternoon and found that this beach was really the best."
Three Sixty Guides,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"people are sometimes disappointed by the beaches in Seminyak, the sand is dark owing to the volcanic nature of the island. However, the long, wide beach is much more than simply a place to play by the beach. It's a place to meet the locals, do some shopping, surf, body board, play beach volleyball, eat, drink, get a massage and soak up the sun. there is always something happening, it's a slice of the Bali life."
crazytraveller123,"delhi, india",Jun 2018,"nice clean beach which is spread for almost a few kms. many sun beds and also has many famous beach clubs and restaurants like cocoon, la plancha etc. best place to learn surfing / swim / dip and enjoy a beer. "
liztrev8,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jun 2018,"Warm water, small waves to dumping surf,  but this is the best beach location in the area in our view, and the locals are very friendly.Enjoy a double lounger and umbrella for the two of you for 100,000 Rp or $10 Australian for the day and ice cold beer for $2:50Regardless of where you are you will experience the local peddlers trying to sell you anything they can. But be polite as this is their  living  but be aware that they will return multiple times so just ignore them and they will move on. Dogs are everywhere but seldom a problem and the beaches are regularly cleaned although plastic  bags and other rubbish can be evident at different times.Enjoy a leisurely stroll to and from Kuta and take in the holiday atmosphere. As it’s currently school holidays here  there are multiple kites in the air. It’s a great spot. Hope you enjoy your stay as much as we are."
matthewoliver0101,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,It was pretty similar with Seminyak Beach since it was all connected but it has really comfy chairs where you can rent and enjoy the sunset while relaxing.
ammaus n,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2018,"The beach is great fmto walk along between Kuta and Seminyak but irs sad to see the extent of rubbish and human impact on the area, especially if you arrive at sunrise before the local volunteers clean the shore... not the cleanest ocean water either, and rough waves but still overall a lovely beach in Bali to wander down."
Nupur U,19 contributions,Jun 2018,Clean and beautiful beach with all the eatries nearby. Located in the middle of seminyak this beach has nice decent crowd as well
Nishank,Delhi,May 2018,"I went to B9B on a weekday evening, and boy was I impressed. The ambience, the people, the servers, and the entertainment everything fits like a piece of one jigsaw puzzle. Beachside Restaurants are moderately priced, so a visit won't hurt your pocket much."
mulletmason,"Thornlands, Australia",Jun 2018,"We stayed in Seminyak for 5 days and we walked to this beach a few times during our stay.It has the usual hustle and bustle for chairs, surfboards and whatever else the ""walkers"" have to offer, so don't be scared to try and haggle a price that doesn't upset your budget. First day we got some been bags on the beach for free with a few beers, then moved down towards Kuta and got a surfboard and 2 chairs for however long we wanted for 100.000IDR. It was mine and my wife's first time trying to surf, and we really enjoyed it. I didn't stay out too long as a have a sore shoulder, but for the short while I was out it was great fun. I'm by far an expert of surfing, but if you are going to give it a go, it is definitely a great spot to try. Pick your spot and your set as big and small waves come and go quite frequently. Can see why a lot of surfers enjoy coming here.The ""walkers"" will probably get on your nerves after a while, some actually tell you to pay them to leave, but that's Bali for you!Great beach and would recommend a visit and a surf!"
Cam0909,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,"As this spot is the closest to our stay in Seminyak, it was easy to get here. We arrived about 1.5hour before sunset and the weather was really nice that day, with strong breeze. I prefer here vs Kuta beach for sunset as is less packed and there are some cafes along the beach for drinks or meals."
Sowen100,"Naples, Italy",May 2018,"We stayed here for four nights in May 2018 and chose this hotel because of it location on the beach and seemingly high rating. This hotel has a great pool, lovely roof top bar, serves a great breakfast and had the friendliest staff. Our issue was with the rooms. The air con in the room which we were given initially stank the room out (we noticed this when we returned to the room in the evening a were greeted by the pungent stench of mildew and dampness). It was almost unbearable and coupled with this were the very damp bed sheets. The next day, following our complaint, we were moved to a new room which didn’t smell on a higher floor. Looking back at some of the reviews on Tripadvisor it seems the air con issue has been going on for over 3 years so I really don’t know why it hasn’t been resolved. "
Tania S,"Dunedin, New Zealand",May 2018,"Acro the road from our hotel, several casual cafes on the beach... all playing music and great value for money"
Chevalian,"New Forest National Park Hampshire, UK",May 2018,"To be honest. theres not a great deal to chose between the three - Double Six, Legian, and Kuta beaches. You may as well choose the most convenient for your hotel location. After all, they are really all just one ultra long beach which you can walk the entire length of without interruption, division into three sections is arbitrary. But for me Double Six has the edge because the beachfront restaurants and bars here are more to my taste, I reviewed B9B (Blue Nine Beach restaurant) elsewhere on here. Some take credit cards, some don't, best to ask first. Sunshades, loungers, cold beers brought to you all day by whichever vendor ""owns"" the spot you have settled in, what more can you want? Of course there are always the hawkers selling anything from ice creams to dodgy watches, but not as persistent as Kuta Beach. Despite some reports, the sea is not always good for surfing and the sunsets are not always spectacular, so if these are your focus of attention you may be disappointed. But thats true for the whole coast."
gobigsal,"Bicester, Oxfordshire",May 2018,"Difficult to find a spot where there isn’t loud music being pumped out of the speakers from one of the many bars. Gets really busy at sunset as everyone seems to come out for the spectacle. Plenty of comfy sun beds & umbrellas to rent at 100,000 rupiah each or $10 AUS. Possible to negotiate with some places. Sea looks great with lots of surf but red flags all along indicating dangers. Doesn’t seem to stop swimmers & surfers. There is at least one life guard. Sand is really very fine volcanic dust that sticks to everything."
Joanne S,3 contributions,May 2018,"Double six beach is somewhere we have visited all 3 trips to bali!   We often go to Zanzibars for a dinner meal, then head down the beach to grab a drink on bean bags and watch the musical entertainment at one of the beach bar type places.  Often you will see fireworks, or lanterns floating away in the sky, which is nice!  The only downside to double six beach is that there is many, many people trying to sell you things (watches, toys, sarongs, etc) and it can get a bit annoying sometimes.  They are often very friendly, but sometimes persistent and it makes me feel a little bad knocking people back all the time.  Worth it though.  Brilliant at sunset.   I actually proposed to my other half a few years back on this beach!  "
TaraKapur,"Mumbai, India",May 2018,My son got an instant surf lesson here and was able to surf! lots of public toilets some with showers. We could sit on sun beds (on payment) and get drinks from the vendors passing by. clean beach! 
Jules65Brisbane,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2018,"There are plently of cafes on the beach with bean bags and live music, best enjoyed around 6pm onwards.  It's always a great way to relax for a couple of hours watching the sun set and having a couple of beers."
Poery B,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"less crowd than Kuta, with same beautifulness to Kuta. white sandy beach, low and mid tide, good for training surfing "
balimamma,"Ubud, Indonesia",May 2018,"this beach is lovely for surfing and spending a day but it gets very tiring to keep telling all the vendors no. They sell everything, paintings, watches, glasses, fruit, toys, dvd. I would be surprised if one of them comes by with furniture. Good sunbeds with drinks and boogie or surf boards available."
ABajwa01,"Greater London, UK",Mar 2018,Long beach to walk along but there is quite a lot of litter but lots of places to eat with live singers and these outlets have a great vibe. 
Emille B,10 contributions,May 2018,"We went to Double Six Beach for the sunset.  We were excited to spend our last evening in Bali watching the sun fall beneath the horizon.  As with all things in the Kuta area, shops outnumber everything but the stray dogs.  Just know, if you go by foot, you'll have to say ""no"" about a hundred times.  However, the biggest disappointment was how the natural beauty of this beach and those waves were spoiled by the trash and general lack of cleanliness.  That's what really hurts, because we've been around the world before and seen high traffic areas and never seen a beach that had such natural beauty so spoiled by man-made, preventable debris.  It was just everywhere and overwhelmed our opportunity to be in the moment.  Though the clouds obscured our direct view, we wanted to stay in the moment, but surrounded as we were by the trash, it was hard to engage fully.  Even as we went to a bar to sit and have a cocktail, the uncleanliness just followed through.  The beach chairs were stained terribly, if I were a business owner, I'd offer a towel to patrons who would like one, I know we would have used it (the stains were irrespective of the beach bar, which were often placed right on the sand).  We left Bali a bit disappointed that they haven't managed their naturally beautiful space carefully, leaving it to tourists, vendors and stray dogs to manage the trash instead of making an effort to keep the area pristine. PS:  the waves are absolutely beautiful, if you want to surf or splash, I see no reason not to here."
Ilina B,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"This was the closest beach from my hotel. Plenty of coffee shops, street vendors and sun lounges available along the beach. Not the cleanest beach, but from what I could read rubbish is a common problem for most of the Bali beaches."
Audrey R,5 contributions,May 2018,I stayed at The Haven hotel which was 15 minutes walk away from the beach. There are many bars along the beach with colourful beanbag chairs for people to sit and look at the amazing sunset view.
Bel C,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2018,"We visited this beach in May. The surf was consistent, smooth and decent size waves for Seminyak Bali. Although sandy compared to neighbouring island like Lembongan it was good for down town Seminyak "
Xmxmm,"Tweed Heads, Australia",May 2018,Was looking for a relaxing day by the beach but was swarmed by sellers as soon as we sat down and was constant all day 
kingofpeppange,"Peppange, Luxembourg",May 2018,"Large - and very long beach !It is not very crowded (at least it was not when I was there !Ideal for longer walks , and you might discover some Australian females sunbathing topless..."
Tambonz,"Waipu, New Zealand",May 2018,"Nice beach a bit spoiled by the VERY numerous traders who ply you with sunglasses, jewellery and deck chairs CONSTANTLY ....not as much as in Kuta Beach but it does spoil the mood a bit."
hermankamsani,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2018,"It's a long stretch sandy beach of Kuta-Seminyak. Get the best view at one of the bar beside the beach with live performance. There's alot of Bar to choose, so get the one that  great live performance, view and sunbeds. Sea breeze was awesome!!!"
ind3ra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2018,"Mind you, the sand is black/darker shade. So, it's not like those pretty beach you see in the magazine. There's still very visible trashes everywhere (I guess they try to clean it recently.)"
madre&padre,Montenegro,May 2018,This beach is part of Kuta-Seminyak long 4 km sandy beach. Water is clear withnot too big waves. You can hire many of sunbeds and chair or take place in some good beach bar like K-Resto!
Anita E,"East Molesey, UK",Apr 2018,"Sat down for a beer and a group of ladies came offering massage which my daughter and I had and enjoyed, then tried selling us more items, I enjoyed this but you must get the prices down to what you want to pay..good experience , nice beach."
Hayley L,"Innisfail, Australia",Dec 2017,"Totally loved sitting on beanbags, listening to some very cool local musicians, sipping Bintangs, watching the glorious sunsets..what else could you ask for after a big day of site seeing? "
danben24456,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Apr 2018,Excellent  restaurant and roof top bar great food.plantation restaurant was excellent.service was really excellent.
Clark Kenneth,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"been here from 4pm and we enjoy the place, at 5pm  they have live band and it was amazing, the vibe is really great and we can drink beer and enjoy the afternoon vibes with the live band. incredible!"
kimmytan2016,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Apr 2018,"A lot more cleaner than kuta beach, and their sunset is truly beautiful. Although it is a bit far (not walking distance but can take Grab and it is quite cheap), the beach is wide and clean, the sunset is beautiful."
dkseaman,3 contributions,Apr 2018,"Sit by the beach on chairs or bean bags... service comes to you with music and bands playing in the background, well priced foods and drinks and a great way to watch the sunset"
Sandie H,"Greater Perth, Australia",Mar 2018,"Staying here for a month I often visit this beach. The time of the year makes a big difference to this beach. From January to March during the rainy season the beaches are very dirty. Lots of wood, coconuts float in but the worst part is floating plastic. So much plastic . The water is fabulous anytime and from April on the beaches and water get cleaner due to lack of rain. In July and August usually very clean. Lots of chairs and beanbags and in the evening, music, fireworks, food and Bintang. Great place to socialise and watch the sun going down. "
The Walking Critic,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2018,Bali is a volcanic island so the sands are never going to be the bleached white grains you find in other holiday destinations. I loved my morning and evening walks before the sun makes it too oppressive to be there. I have to say it was totally clean every time I was there and I did have a dip in the water which was lovely. 
cirque,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"You will never get bored when you visit DoubleSix beach, notable by sun loungers dotting up the beachside with AirAsia umbrellas, when you walk towards Kuta side to the South, you can see some cages with colourful umbrellas and bean bag chairs. Perhaps the most popular one is La Plancha, but others are following the trend. The sand on the beach is a bit dark in colour but overall it's soft sand. "
Rasha Y,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Apr 2018,"One of my fev beach. Very clean ,good ppl Threre is a guy called nyomy he is a good teacher in suffering i learned from him  🏄🏻‍♀️it was great experience "
TheLaskers,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2018, Our first time here beautiful beach very clean hired chairs great spot . It was very close to our villa to walk great cafes and restaurants on beach .Service brought to you.
Christine,New York,Apr 2018,"Double Six Beach definitely has a nice view, but it is not a beach for laying out and spending time by the water. Better to sit at a restaurant on the beach to watch the sunset. Sand is dirty."
kayla b,27 contributions,Apr 2018,Awesome beach for sunsets and relaxing on beanbags with table service waiters and lots of live music The water is pretty disgusting so not good for swimming 
Mohan A,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Apr 2018,One of the best places in Kuta to witness the sunset in the evening. Many beach restaurants with bean bag seating and candle lights.Not very expensive but not cheap too.Can recommend this place for a relaxing evening.
Stewart A,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2017,"As far as one can see.   Maybe   2 kms in each direction depending on ones   eyesight.  Waves.  Crisscrossing Waves   coming from the left and right for miles.   And  thousands of  surf  students    .  schools.   and   moderate  waves for the  Balinese  show offs having fun.     Rent a  reclining chair    and   just watch the show.    For a Canadian   ,  Surfing is   really cool.     Exhilirating.    im  talking about watching  not doing. ha ha ha.    Double Six  beach at night is party  time.   Sunset view.    magnificent.     The water here is   safe to  wade into.  all sand.     and shallow despite the  waves.  There was no undercurrent  at this time.    Thousands of students  learning to surf.  very safe."
hopefulalice,"Hope, Canada",Mar 2018,"Save your money and go to a beach that is not covered in garbage and dog excrement! It is crowded & dirty & when you swim, you are hit with garbage! "
Denise,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2018,"I was actually looking forward to the beach in Bali after hearing so many good things about it. Unfortunately, plastics and rubbish are everywhere and I wish the locals and tourists can do their part in preserving the beach and ocean. I have plastics tagged on my leg while walking along the beach. The local has been trying to clean it up, but it really does take greater effort in this. It's really sad to see this. Please, dont throw any rubbish and pick up the rubbish if you see any, you cant do much but little effort goes a long way."
Cecilia D,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2018,"This beach was such a disappointment. I asked and it seems like some months out of the year there are some currents bringing all the garbage to the beach. They clean it in the morning but you have more coming in during the day and at night is disgusting, you cannot even go for a nice walk. The waves are great if you are into surfing and there are some great bars and restaurants with live music. If I new the beaches were like this I would’ve stay somewhere else. I recommend you to check the beach before you rent a place or book a hotel."
Piunti2013,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2018,"Double Six Beach is super busy with people walking down to the beach, scooters & honking taxis. There's plenty of places to eat & drink & just watch the Amazing sunsets. Loads of colorful beanbags & pretty umbrellas to sit under. Walking along the beach down towards Seminyak is fine & feels safe, there are so many people walking about taking photos. Amazing sunsets, no filters needed. Recommend."
Abdulla C,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"Double Six is a pretty happeninng beach. I am probably biased because i lived like 5 minutes from it when i was there - but hey great beach is a great beach! Fun people, fun watering holes, and a bunch of activity abuzz."
Kaztravels74,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2018,"Loved it, very clean for our visit. Great bars etc along the beach. Clean all the way to Kuta. Also walked the opposite direction to main Seminyak and found main Seminyak beach filthy, covered in rubbish and barely anyone on the beach. Double 6 to Kuta loads of people but plenty of places to sit and relax."
Deborah C,"St Marys, Australia",Mar 2018,Beautiful sunset...stunning a must to see....food excellent people outstanding.....plenty of markets nearby ....kids will love this place .great for a stop for a drink or two
_bay_lucas,"Olinda, PE",Mar 2018,"Beautiful beach to enjoy the sunset, presents an exotic scenery here. Access is also easy close to the center of the crowd. If you start the afternoon many restaurants and pubs that open here, can to relax and enjoy the sunset."
havingfunagain,"Cambridge, MA",Mar 2018,Very nice beach. Wonderful warm waters with many chairs and umbrellas to choose from. There is a cost. Just a not: they do try to clean it up in the a.m. for there is much rubbish that comes from the sea and other parts of Indonesia.
sandeep k,"Mumbai, India",Mar 2018,"The beach was very crowded. It was not clean as well, a lot of plastic bags/cans thrown around. Better go to simniyak beach (near anantara hotel), it's closed by and much better than double six."
Peter L,9 contributions,Feb 2018,"The beach is very busy and noisy with everything it comes with it. Sellers of everything, guys that force you to rent a sunbed or surf and a lot of different music styles from bars that are just few meters from each other."
monika a,9 contributions,Mar 2018,"this beach will very crowded in the afternoon especially before sunset. if you want to go to this beach, please prepare 1 hour before the sunset time (you can check the sunset schedule in the internet). if not, you cant find the parking lot (if you bring car) or you cant find a good place to enjoy the sunset time :Dbring you friends here, just sitting on the beach while drinking dan chatting with your best friends. :)"
BG01,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2018,Relax with beach beds and umbrellas all day. Friendliest locals go out of their way. You can get great nase gireng cooked fresh on the beach and drinks brought to your chair
janacb47,"Gold Coast, Australia",Nov 2017,"Average but nice for swimming. Good for bargain shopping out of deckchair, not having to move. Loved the Balinese people so friendly and happy."
Liz M,"Canning Vale, Australia",Mar 2018,If the afternoon is clear and not overcast head down for an amazing sunset.Grab a beanbag and enjoy a beverage or a meal  (or both) and people watch as you watch the sun go down.Most places have live music and the food is generally okay.Seminyak beach is cleaner than the Kuta area.Great spot to get some romantic photos.Just be prepared to be asked to buy a number of things from hawkers while you sit. And if you say yes to one be aware word gets out 😎
Irina P,9 contributions,Mar 2018,Amazing beach especially in the evening for the sunset watching.A lot of restaurants with good food :).
505SaadNafai,8 contributions,Mar 2018,Nice place to chill out with friends all day long In the evening you can enjoy the live music bands playing front off the beach restaurants while having drinks or food..the improvement of that place is on the shoulders of the municipality who should have a real impact about cleanliness of the seminyak beaches ... Also I have been in Jimbaran side the beaches over there are really sorry.. The fish market in jimbaran need a lot of improvement.. Saad Nafai
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,The water is thick with garbagd. I mean you wade through it. This is so thick now you will be covered in nappies and plastic n rubbish. Balis beaches are now the most polluted in the world.The rubbish piles up on the beach its horrible. This has been getting worse every year but the Indonesian government does nothing.
trippie784,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,"The beach is the most time clean, but after a rainy day is it dirty on the beach. Sand not white but plenty of beach lazy boys to rent if you want."
theCheeseFamily,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2018,clean beach..nice sunset..lovely beach..good for relaxing..no lights when night time..short distance to shops/restaurants/bar..
614allany,"Durban, South Africa",Feb 2018,"We visited this beach area on a Thursday around 10 am.There was not much happening, with very few beach goers. The local “merchants “ were relentless and made the morning very frustrating to try and relax.There was a lot of plastic debris coming onto the beach from the sea, making the beach seem dirty and untidy. Some locals kept their areas tidy but the overall pollution was disappointing. Not a beach we would choose to revisit."
gensivalingam,"George Town, Malaysia",Feb 2018,The place was to busy and the beach need to be more organized and cleaned up for me which can be improved
Brenda0913,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,"The beach was filled with litter and garbage, the sea and sand is  Greyish and we were there for  5 min and headed straight back to our villa."
I Gede A,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2018,"Bali holiday.. Wow double six beach seminyak, got your relax through breeze and laying under the sun will change your skin become brown funtastic, Ready to assist you, please call us +6281999529816"
Keith R,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2018,"With heaps of different beach bars to choose from, from La Plancha at the north end down the Franks Bar Dreadlock Maker at the Legian Southern end.All with a vast array of local characters, vendors and ice cold drinks.With new toilets being build, little beach warungs popping up and all the restaurants nearby, it's easy to see why lunch turns into sunset drinks."
Jo B,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2018,"What was once, I'm sure, a pristine beautiful surf beach is now covered in plastic litter. It floats in on the waves and lies deposited all over the beach. The Balinese culture just wasn't prepared for the plastic that the demands of western tourists required. For years there were no bins, because in Balinese culture food was carried in banana leaves and containers made of palm leaves, all of which composted down and went back into the soil. They didn't need bins. Now there are bins for the plastic but the residue is evident all over Bali, particularly on its main tourist beaches near Kuta. If you want clean white sand on pristine beaches, go to Australia."
Tesremos,"Bristol, UK",Feb 2018,This beach is probably more for the surfers than for the sun seekers. There were many pop-up bars but unfortunately there were large piles of rubbish and driftwood at bout 50m intervals along the sandy beach. Whether this was a short-term rubbish collection problem or the norm is not known but other reviews say much the same.
Lorraine C,"Worcester, South Africa",Feb 2018,"Dont expect Bali beaches to live up to the expectations in your head. The beach was filled with litter and garbage, the sea and sand is greyish and we didnt even sit down for a drink but headed straight back to the villa. Also, there were dogs making poo's on the beach and the owners didnt  bother to pick it up (dont think there are rules about it). Not worth visiting at all."
Keenan K,16 contributions,Feb 2018,"Covered in as much litter as every other beach. Lots of umbrella seats and just as many locals offering you a drink and other consumables and items for purchase. Keep your shoes on, you never know what's buried in the sand. Stray dogs poop mostly everywhere.Average view. Close to the shops. Nice Hotels nearby.Peak hour is around 6:30pm onwards and the bars nearby really get going. The bars are probably more of an attraction than the beach."
59_lee,"Wolverhampton, United Kingdom",Dec 2017,"Possible the worst beach we have ever visited. OMG the state of it, rubbish & litter, the sea is, in some area's dark grey.. Enjoyed couple of bars. Thats the limit."
jonesem92,New Jersey,Feb 2018,Garbage everywhere. Walk South to Kuta Beach for slightly less garbage. Apparently it’s not like this all year but who knows.
Gwyn J,"London, UK",Feb 2018,"A long and safe bech for swimming with the biggest waves.  Lots of people surfing but plenty of space for everyone.  There are quiet areas of the beach and lively areas with lots of bars and restaurants.  Saturday and Sunday were very busy especially nearing sunset, but the rest of the week was quiet in comparison.  The one and probably only downside was the incredible amount of plastic washed up on the beach. Its just a few meters around what appears to be the high tide mark and goes literally the whole length of the beach.  The water itself seems quite clean and so does the beach higher up than the high tide mark, but the amount of plastic has to be seen to be believed."
nashr0,"Margaret River, Australia",Feb 2018,"After walking for hours to find this unique location, we stumbled up the stair case from the promenade and were greeted by smiling staff happy to assist, we requested this roof top bar locations and were escorted to the lifts, greeted again by helpful smiling staff guided up to the rooftop bar and met by a cheerful hostest egar to find us the best location face the ocean veiws and breeze waiting staff quickly perused with drinks, cocktail list and tapas style snacks. No sooner had we ordered food and beverages arrived, uninterrupted panoramic vista of Bali shores with a great sound track playing in the back ground all made for a very rewarding trekWe were offered another round of drinks to welcome in the sunset which is breathlessly pleasing come duskDont waste any time catch a cab to 66 and enjoy the experience as we were for tunate enou6ght too"
Andy P,50 contributions,Feb 2018,Really disappointed with our visit to this beach. It is pretty much a rubbish/plastic dump and no one seems to care.It’s is not pleasant to walk on or see. I wouldn’t be keen to swim there either.
Hans O,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2018,We are used to clean beaches but these ones are filthy. went for a walk early in the morning and the receding tide had left a wall of rubbish on the beach- would definitely not want to swim there
fclaus49,"San Francisco, CA",Jan 2018,During rain season there are lots of plastic everywhere until it's cleaned away. Definitely not optimal for kids. This time of the year is definitely a no go for beach lovers
Albywon,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2018,These are the pictures that Bali Tourism does not want you to see!But in the end this is how it looks in early February in the rain. Small parts of the beach are cleaned up by the small tourism operators trying to sell Lounge chair space.2200
kathryn soo,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2018,This side of beach is quite dirty. There is rubbish everywhere although the waves might be good for surfers. There is tractors collecting rubbish but the tractors just collect the rubbish and put it aside. Not a place to chill but can just take a walk at this beach if you are staying at hotels opposite the beach
saraost98,62 contributions,Jan 2018,"Don't bother if you've actually seen a nice beach in your life because this is a grey sanded, rubbish filled, dirty watered dump."
muhfikhrii,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jan 2018,"Coming to double six beach, i always come to visit bakso tenda biru. It offers the meatball of local food. You may see many Indonesian come to visit here, it you eat spicy food? Try Bakso tenda biru."
lillypilly72,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2018,"What can I say awful dirty beach, rubbish everywhere and unkept, not suitable for swimming, tractors everywhere collecting rubbish, not a tourist site to visit, better beaches elsewhere."
Dimas A K,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2017,A good time when u visit this place in the 4.30pm. First time u must try is a Bakso Gerobak Biru and the Onde-onde. While waiting sunset u can enjoy and relax on a chair. Wonderful sunset!
Linda W,2 contributions,Dec 2017,"We holiday  Christmas in nusa dua resort one week which was beautiful  then 2weeks in Seminyak at double six beach so disappointed , very dirty we could not believe it ,we had villa so had our own small pool so fab  for us if not omg would  have been wasted dream of we thought Bali should be ,also the threat of mount agong eruption keeping tourist away lost the spirit of the true Bali experience.Linda & Allan from Scotland x"
Gautham_hr,"Bengaluru, India",Jan 2018,"Nice beach with many small shacks.. u can grab a quick bite, like, meat bowl, noodles etc.. maybe some beer or some juice too.. good to laze around in the evening watching the sun go down.. it’s clean too...Ps- I’ve seen a few of the locals mocking traveler’s there.. not too harmful though.. "
Imoy1979,3 contributions,Jan 2018,"Loved to spent afternoon here on double six beach,always ate a nice bakso gerobak biru,enjoyed the beautiful sunset,with a cold beer."
rrrebekah,47 contributions,Aug 2017,"Perfect place to get a tan, lounge about, or watch the sunset on a bean-bag chair. Can be crowded at times but not packed like Kuta is, and definitely without a horde of people trying to hustle you. Would definitely revisit!"
Mamba_11,"New Delhi, India",Jan 2018,This one is a nice beach with lot of people around. Best part is the live singing that happens in front of couple of cafes. Comparatively longer beach with lots of waves which is usual in Bali.
Colin A,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Jan 2018,Surf looked fine but the beach is dirty. Lots of dogs and so much plastic waste.  There has been a half hearted effort to clean but I will not go back. They have started to clean up the streets of Bali so why wouldn’t they also make a real effort with the beaches?
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Jan 2018,"Much less crawled than Kuta counterpart, which is already huge plus. Lots of umbrellas to rent for small fee, plenty of afternoon live entertainment venues and of course very noce spot to enjoy sunset."
tonithomson5,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2018,"Stunning all along double 6 . Lots of places to eat with good food selections, great offerings of different types of seats. Beautiful sunsets 🌅"
Kyksta,Singapore,Dec 2017,"My favourite beach in Bali. I have been here around 7 times at various times in the year. Yes, unfortunately there is alot of rubbish on the beach around Xmas time, but this rubbish all comes from Java and the nearby islands. The Balinese do their best to clear it up - but there really is alot. At any other time of the year the beaches are lovely. A great place to sit on a deckchair under an umbrella and relax. Surf lessons and boogie board hire is also on offer. Drinks service available. A great way to spend the way."
330priya,23 contributions,Jan 2018,I had much better expectations from beaches in Bali. There was trash around. I felt as if I was on Juhu beach
Denis Y,79 contributions,Jan 2018,"Yet another great beach in Bali. Friendly people, relaxing atmosphere, paradise on earth. Go, relax and enjoy freedom you have never known"
raicr22,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Had some great waves here and hung out for sunset a few times at some of the warungs on the beach. relaxing!
HPorter90,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Dec 2017,"This isn't a nice beach. As much as there will be trash washed up from the ocean there is no effort from tourists to not contribute to more waste, and nor for anyone to maintain the beach. We had no idea about this beforehand, and walking along the beach on the first day of our holiday was not the way to get in the holiday mood."
Grant F,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2018,This is a great beach for surfers and for beach walking.  It is particularly good for the late afternoon drink at one of the many warungs.  Pity about the garbage washing up on the beach however....
Joakim L,"Malaga, Spain",Jan 2018,The beach is nice (january) awesome to surf in when its as many wawes as today! I hope they clean up the garbage everyday because its coming up on the beach everyday!
Brian J,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2018,"Double Six beach is almost perfect. The water is warm, the waves are just right, not too small or too big. Ideal beach to swim with no rips - safe for children and great waves to start learning how to surf. Plenty of available chairs and umbrellas for rental at a cheap price. Lots of restaurants available just off the beach. The only negative is the constant badgering of the locals trying to sell you something on the beach who don't take no for an answer easily"
James O,"Connemara, Ireland",Jan 2018,Visited here from Kuta. Take blue bird taxi and go on meter. Quoted 105000 rupiah 23000 on meter big difference. Beach is nice not as crowed as Kuta. Big waves here but safe if you stay between flags. Not as many hawkers thanks be to god. Sunbeds hired out two for 100000 for day haggle. If looking for a beer drink at vendors hiring sunbeds much cheaper than beach bars. La planche almost twice the price. Overall nice experience.
Al_21_121,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2018,Three main beaches situated next to one another Food is good Gr8 atmosphere Staff friendlyIf you are able to view a sunset do it ...an experience wow ... 
Samantha E,40 contributions,Nov 2017,We had the most fun learning to surf on this beach.  The waves are really good for beginners.  And it's a very social beach so it's easy to find cool people to have a drink with after you catch some waves.
doncasterlevi,doncaster,Jan 2018,"The Government pleaded with people to come to Bali and there is nothing they can control about the brewing volcano but they can control and should managing the condition of the beaches The rubbish was disgusting over the new year period so much people staying in hotels along the beach had to go to other areas to find a better beach It is a disgrace that tourist tax is taken and for what ever reason they cannot even clean up the beaches Someone should be responsible for this because many people I spoke too would not come back , not because of the volcano but because of the disgustingly poorly managed beaches "
CuriousTravellerDXB,Dubai,Dec 2017,Two words. Don't visit. Filthy (note: rainy season contributed to the state of the beach but tourist attitude and littering has a lot to do with it). 
Paulo B,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2018,"Like most of the beaches in Bali, trash is abundant at the sand and in the ocean. The current status of the beaches in Bali undermines the all Bali experience. Photos may be misleading and this is not a white sand beach."
Echa Marditicha,200 contributions,Jan 2018,"Not really a nice beach but here you could just go and sit down on bean bags from cafes and restaurants along the beach to enjoy the sunset with live music. Things to do here are surfing, playing kites, swim etc. The prices are a bit crazy expensive for foods and beverages, the taste was not so worth the price for the cafe."
Mimo M,1 contribution,Jan 2018,"Dirty beach, very very dirty sea.You must walk a lot forward before the sea level reaches your shoulder.Thailand is a much better place than Bali"
Arvinder G,"Seoul, South Korea",Jan 2018,"This beach is just visit but not good for family activities ,been there two different times but mostly flooded with local and Australian young crowds ,good for visit but not for fun"
Nana nana,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2017,"Location is near the airport, the sunset scenery is beautiful, i love drinking coconut and eating bakso which sold everywhere around the beach. And it's good to spend time with friends in this beautiful beach."
Anais A,93 contributions,Dec 2017,The sunset in this beach is so pretty as you can see in the picture below that was taken effortlesly
rdk1,"Melbourne, Victoria",Dec 2017,"We were there in December and the beach was filthy. Washed up plastic, muck on the tide line, and unsuitable for swimming."
twiinklex,762 contributions,Oct 2017,"I love this beach mainly because it wasn't too crowded or noisy, nor was there any litter. Maybe I came on the right month. The waves looked awesome and the sunset was perfect. There is also lots of variety when it comes to food and drinks, all at pretty affordable prices.Beautiful beach! Perfect for unwinding with a book and drink. Come early to snag a good spot for the sunset."
CongiaEnterprises,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2017,Be prepared to have locals approach you and solicit their wares.the sand is not yellow like most believe and the waves do pound hard. Great for a quick surf.
Cragledog,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2017,"Had been here many times before but in July and early December. Unfortunately a great amount of rubbish and large debris (large logs) on beach.  They were clearing it slowly, but there is only so much they can do.  Was told by life guard not safe to swim because of debris. Very disappointing as have walked up and down this beach and has been very clean and children swum and took surfing lessons. Was told rubbish came in from neighbouring islands, not sure about that, more like from Bali due to seasonal rain and winds. Very disappointed, will try Sanur which is cleaner but no surf."
Josie V,3 contributions,Nov 2017,We have had cocktails on the roof over looking the ocean. Followed by beautiful home made pastas. Bellissimo.
ravifour,"Pearland, TX",Nov 2017,"nice place with tons of restaurants, bars and other vendors.I have seen people get foot massage on the beach and drinking coconuts. Lots of scooter rentals, bike rentals and surf lessons and or surf board rentals. good place to spend a day or half a day"
Melissa  H,"Cairns, Australia",Dec 2017,Filthy beach filled with plastic. Daughter waded in camd out 2minutes later with a huge plastic bag. We live in Palm Cove so are aware of the plastic dangers for sea creatures. Pro's though quite Area and nowhere near as foul a Kuta. Balinese clean up your filth.
kenley t,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2017,"Come at night, but nothing to do. only some bars with live music. the beach well maintain .need some lights more."
pkaran,"Pune District, India",Oct 2017,"Double Six beach is pretty close to Seminyak beach, so visit to both beaches can be clubbed. It is a nice, neat and clean beach with several options and activities to do."
Martin W,15 contributions,Oct 2017,"After you fight your way through the café, bar chairs & beer sellers eskys that clog up every entrance & access point, you arrive at a beach that is just like all beaches in the area, overpopulated. You are much better off going to one of the many other glorious beaches on this island that is away from the tourist hotspots"
shrey20152015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,A happening beach...many good beach shacks...surfing...the main road leading to the beach is lined by shops selling all varieties of stuffs.Clean in August when we went.
Sirimon,"Harrow, UK",Nov 2017,"Great place for seeing beautiful sunsets while sipping a beer.  However, would recommend paying a bit extra and going to one of the rooftop bars for two main reasons 1) the beach was filthy - cans, bottles, plastic bags, rotting food, etc etc was littered all along the beach and presumably it all gets washed into the sea at high tide, and 2) very noisy beach bars as they set up large speakers on the beach that blare out music at full volume."
Sebastian K,"Helsinki, Finland",Nov 2017,"During low tide there are lots of plastic everywhere until it's cleaned away. There is a cleaning crew, but in November there is a lot of debris after high tide.The beach is not for swimmers, more for surfers. It is at it's best at sunset when you can watch the sun go down and chill while listening to live music. Definitely not optimal for kids."
PatBintang,"Lanzarote, Spain",Nov 2017,This time of the year is definitely a no go for beach lovers. Huge amounts of plastic and other trash plus stinking rivers. Horrible!
hubi61,"Manchester, UK",Nov 2017,"A good place for Surfer, when you need beginner lessons.  The beach is the most time clean, but after a rainy day is it dirty on the beach."
61Greg,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,Not a bad beach for surfing yet also a safe beach for little kids as the waves break out a bit.  Sand not white but plenty of beach lazy boys to rent if you want.
60jonno,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2017,No use complaining about bali beaches. Unless they are in front of an expensive beachside hotel they will be messy - and even then might still be messy. But you go there for the ability to sit on the beach in warm sunny weather and be served cheap cold beer delivered to you while reclining on a chair or bean bag also provided. All in all it is a relaxing and cheap  break. This beach is possibly a bit better than many and with the new wall being built  perhaps filters out some of the mess when viewed from hotels ?
AnthDR,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,We found the sea water so dirty its not that healthy to surf here Bali needs to clean things because tourists don't like it.
AussieRicho1,"Wollongong, Australia",Nov 2017,"This beach is north of Kuta beach and can be easily accessed from Legian street, past Legian and close to Seminyak. Or just walk up the beach from Kuta. It will take you about 30 minutes or so. Nice sunsets. Plenty of beach chairs to hire."
Michael W,8 contributions,Oct 2017,"Great spot to learn or to hone your surf skills. Plenty of other things to do here like body surf, swim, catch a suntan, fly a kite, enjoy a bintang, have a massage, buy some goodies, have a decent lunch and watch a wonderful sunset."
Iwan P,7 contributions,Sep 2017,one of beach along kuta beach area exactly front of double six hotel at arjuna street.You can enjoy atmosfer charming place with seat on the sofa on the white sands with a botle cold beer and if need food..many pub n bar behind your sofabest time at sunset time...amazing
DeborahLBrisbane,Brisbane,Oct 2017,"Great place to take in the stunning Bali sunset.  Enjoy good food, beverages and live music whilst relaxing in a bean bag on the sand."
Jerry J,174 contributions,Oct 2017,"Double six beach has restaurants and bars on the beach front itself. There is more going on than compared to beaches in Kuta or Legian, although just as busy. I would definitely recommend checking it out even if you have to make the trip from Kuta. Just make sure you come for sunset.  "
Natal Surbakti,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2017,"Bali pamper us with many choice of good beached and this one is one of the best . The favorite time to come here is during sunset time between 6 to 7 pm . It could be crowded yet vibrant and live . Enjoy the bakso with teh botol, cost you less than 30K and enjoy the sunset view if 1 Million  USD"
brittain2003,19 contributions,Oct 2017,Not the nicest beach in Bali. Lots of litter and lots of touts trying to sell fake goods. Spoils what could be a nice beach
evert0n1,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2017,"By day the beach is nice not crowded and good to learn how to surf, at sunset there’s four beach bars B9B is my favourite food good and the Bintang cold with bean bags to listen to the duos playing laid back songs..."
Deb F,"Geelong, Australia",Nov 2017,Had dinner with friends further up the beach then walked Wong the 66' beach with all the wonderful restaurants sat on the bean bags in the sand listening to the waves chatting quietly with a nice liquor to finish off the night so peaceful and relaxing   I so love Bali 
Greg C,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2017,"A quiet walk on the beach you dodge the rubbish and look out for broken glass. Lovely sunsets, nice restaurants."
Vee272014,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,Such a beautiful setting for a sunset drink or whatever you please. Plenty of beanbags to lay around on and just watch the world go by
clavis2016,"Sydney, Australia",May 2017,"This is a little hideaway a beach for everyone...Once you find this you will return for it's splendour,clean sand, amenities and the usual Balinese welcoming! it is situated in an ideal position and easy to get to as u stroll down to the Double Six Beach with its charming coffee & tourist shops. Fronting the beach is a fine selection of foods for every taste from take away, casual or fine dining... IT's A MUST..........."
tonysprings,hartlepool,Oct 2017,Fantastic sandy beach served by lots of restaurants on the beach....the perfect place to lay and sunbathe the world away
franzico m,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2017,"nice view , good for relax or chit chat while you can drink beer.Good beach for expert surfer.. you should go to this beach when you visit bali."
pnssnp,"Vadodara, India",Oct 2017,"located in walking distance to the hotel mariott, it is a very happening beach with music bands playing on the clean sands."
Sonta S,3 contributions,Oct 2017,Enjoying sunset with colorful parasol along with live music from local band. You need to buy drink + snack so you can sit on the bean sack chair.
Let's Go Sightseeing,"Noida, India",Jun 2017,"This beach has enough & more options for shacks & beach chairs. You can sit here for hours & watch all the activity happening around you. The water isn't too cold; so you can opt for a dip.However, the beach needs to be more clean. We saw of stream of black water coming from inland & getting released into the sea. Not good!"
Stewart A,"Toronto, Canada",Oct 2017,breathtaking to watch the  surf rise up  for miles in each direction.   the  sand floor was  flat for  hundreds of meters out  so there was no  undertow  in many spots.   great for  body surfing  or sitting  meditating upon the  ocean waves.  fun to watch the  surfers doing tricks.   
mascotty02,"Greater Manchester, UK",Oct 2017,"Loved the beach and again the locals are very friendly and kind, went to a couple of the beach huts for the deck chairs and a few beers, lots of wind surfers and lovely Australians, can watch them surf for hours, "
Jen H,"Lismore, Australia",Oct 2017,"I always appreciate the comfortable water temperature, being  able to walk in wasily for a swim. Double Six has the wonderful bean bag bars later in the afternoon- walk arou d until you find music that suits your tastes and check out the differing prices for drinks and food as they vary greatly. The beach here  was clean. Walking further south to Legian showed disgusting rubbish on the waterline and sand. What a pity that the huge beach front resorts do not employ locald to keep the beach clean: the hotels make a huge amount of money from these beaches but obviously take no repsonsibility for their upkeep. Kudos to Kuta and Seminyak for taking time to enssure that their lives beaches are cleaned."
MateEeMa,"Helsinki, Finland",Jan 2017,"Disgustingly dirty beach like all the beaches nearby. Would not spent time there yet alone swim. Full of trash. Was bad 7 years ago when we first visited, even worse now."
Deviranti G,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Oct 2017,"lovely spot to watch sunset, the guy in charge came to me when i sat on the beach bench, and asked for how long i'll be there, the rent was IDR300,000/hours.. and I said ""i'll be there only until 6PM (around 2 hours) so, how much?"" then the guy said, ""i'll give u 150 then"".. i was like ""???"" with a cool face.. but then it's a deal! hahaha.. ^oo^ ,  i enjoy the beach (even if i lost my glasses by a big wave hit)."
Dr_coffee_bh,"Bali, Indonesia",Sep 2017,I love this beach just you can learn to surf or just enjoy the waves or just watch the amazing sunset.just keep away from the red flags (CAREFUL THE UNDERCURRENT)
Tracey D,12 contributions,Oct 2017,Great little spot. Relax on a beanbag with a cocktail and enjoy the sunset. Live music and fireworks the night we were there.
SarahDurban,"Cape Town, South Africa",Oct 2017,"Got dropped off by a taxi in the main car park. Could only access the beach in little alleys/certain areas due to all the construction and walls. A few tired and dirty restaurants line what access you do have, and you constantly get harassed by guys offering transport of scooters. Wouldn't waste time going here. I was very disappointed."
StPolo,"Liverpool, UK",Oct 2017,Very popular with surfers and body boarders. Not a beach where you can swim but wave jumping is great. All ameninities are available on the beach
Elke M,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2017,"The beach is very flat and also very clean with dark brown sand. Lots of water sports available, as well as hire of day beds, beanbags etc. good atmosphere with a lot of people around. Also a lot of locals trying to sell merchandise."
Joanne L,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2017,"The first thing my husband and I wanted to experience was a beach walk along Double Six Beach.At first, it seemed pleasant enough until you came across the flow of brown water eminating from a number of areas into the sea.The smell was nauseating and made us want to rush back to the hotel. So disappointing, considering Bali depends on it's Tourism market. The Bali authorities need to fix this as a matter of urgency. It could be wonderful but it clearly isn't!"
Lydia A,9 contributions,Sep 2017,We started our travels in Seminyak before going onto other areas of Bali and other islands in Indonesia. The was my least favourite beach as it was more like dirt than sand and actually smelt like bad dog breath. Much nicer beaches in Indonesia! Would recommend the Gili Islands if you like perfect beaches.
Phill S,Australia,Oct 2017,Great bars and excellent place to watch sunset . Hire a beach chair and umbrella and enjoy a beer or cocktail. 
T S,"Jupiter, FL",Oct 2017,Very cool atmosphere at night. Several beach bars playing live music on the sand. Lots of people walking around. Several surf schools open during the day. Beach is cleaned each morning. Can walk for ever. Great people watching.
chris282,44 contributions,Jul 2017,Lots of beach vendors who would come around to offer their goods for sale. Beach is alway crowded with people who wants to get a fast bucks from you. Lots of beach sun deck for suntanning session
Nurzariah__Z,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2017,One of my fav beaches! We were there two times during our 8 days trip. Chill out to catch sunset with a bottle of tea sosro and a bowl of bakso. Yummy! We were staying in Legian during our last days in Bali but we don’t mind travelling all the way here as we prefers this beach than Kuta! 
Tania W,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,"Went there for an afternoon lunch and drink, great place near the pool, recommend the tempura prawns. Service was great. Lovely bathrooms"
Armaminta,"Cobram, Australia",Sep 2017,"We actually visited sept 2016 but can't go back that far. The beach was kept really clean, there were lifeguards which, unfortunately, my teens had to be aided by.l as they were nearly swept out in a strong rip. Beach hawkers were plentiful and a bit pushy but it was all stuff we were interested in. Daughters got their braids done for $15 for long hair which was way cheaper than anywhere else and, in my opinion, more memorable for them. We had pedicures and bought souvenirs. Rented a tent but was charged the full day price even though he cleared up an hour after we arrived at 3.30pm. He just laughed at me and said, per hour price so be clear! We didn't get upset, it's one of those things! One night we had dinner st the beach and it was a magical experience. We sat on bean bags around the table as the sun set and the musicians set up. We danced, laughed, talked and ate. Seven of us and it cost around $70 AUD. we didn't let the kids swim at night of course. Renting surfboards was easy, arranging surf lessons was easy. Everyone is geared up for Aussie families. Plenty of pubs around the place. Good cheap breakfasts. "
beccax22,"London, UK",Sep 2017,"Nice stretch of beach. Sand is definitely one of the softest I have ever walked on (no shells or rocks to be seen). Definitely more of a place for surfing than going in for a swim. There are signs that say you can't go in for a swim, but of course we went in for a dip when it was too hot. Having said that, I nearly got hit by a surf board when a big wave came crashing and the girl with the surfboard lost control. So be vigilant!Sunbeds are expensive. For 2 sunbeds and a parasol it was 200,000 idr and we tried to haggle with the man to no avail. The next day we went elsewhere and we were able to get 2 bed ands a parasol for 150,000 after haggling (though the beds weren't as comfy).There is also wifi on the beach if you stay by the central area- great!"
Matthew B,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,A little south on Double Six are the umbrella bars on the sand. They are a great place to watch the sunset and are a lot more basic and chilled then the bigger beach bars.
jc26_11,"Langkawi, Malaysia",Sep 2017,An amazing very long stretch of beach. Beautiful sunsets lots of beach restaurants. Sand clean but water very murky and we saw and smelt sewage flowing into the sea from stream run offs.
JJOH,"Doha, Qatar",Sep 2017,This is an extension to the south of Seminyak beach and suffers in my opinion from over development. Too many sun beds etc on the beach and too many water sports vendors. I realise that these things are there for tourism but perhaps the balance has been lost or perhaps it is simply not what I am looking for. However there are many better beaches elsewhere
jeanette g,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,we stoped in for a drink. Cost us $34 for 2 coctails. we wont bother with thos place again. Also drinks are very small. No great vibe either
Daydream799190,281 contributions,Jul 2017,"Double Six beach is the perfect place for beginners to learn surfing. The waves are not too big, there are a few instructors on the beach and it's not too crowded (like Kuta) "
Carmel H,5 contributions,Sep 2017,"Lots of fun, great teachers who will have you up in no time.Facilities to lock your belongings away, towel is provided, photos at the end of the class to review. Just do it!"
Glenn Nicholls,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,"Alot of construction and remodeling along the road front but what you get once you reach the beach is worth it, friendly locals all competing to make your stay memorable. during our stay in Bali we visited the beach on several afternoons for the sunset we chose different bars and and sections of the beach, We definitely recommend you spend at least one afternoon relaxing and enjoying sunset on Double Six Beach"
Amr E,"Cairo, Egypt",Sep 2017,"Nice beach front.. has an open air club with great selection of music (wont miss its location as it visible and loud)You have lots of restaurants selection, however many of them were under renovation and part of the beach was locked. Most annoying thing is the massive amount of scooters running in the narrow beach walk lane. Riders are very comfortable riding in that narrow area in a two way direction which you have to dance to avoid getting hit by one."
djmcenergy,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2017,"stayed at the double six, and they have a beach club area over the road for guests. nice area that has full service and charge back o room."
owloAustralia,Australia,Sep 2017,"Quite sad to look at, the road along the beach is filthy and covered in construction works and barricades. Beach itsself is not that good, far better ones anywhere in Australia and many other places in the world.   Yes, you can sit in a bean bag and drink and watch the sunset, with a passing parade of predominately heavily inked Australians promenading up and down in their Bintang singlets with a bottle in their hand.  Jalan Arjuna (Double 6 road) itself has some nice little shops and a couple of good places to eat, but far better beaches elsewhere."
Sandra N,"Whangarei, Northland, New Zealand",Sep 2017,Our hotel was a short stroll away from Double Six Beach. We spent many hours relaxing in the bean chairs sipping on a Bintang watching the sunset. Each bar has live music each night and they all fill up prior to the sun setting. The beach itself is a nice beach and great for swimming. Enjoyed our time there.
jastuewe,"Milwaukee, WI",Sep 2017,"the beach was nice and well worth the walk / visit.  we laid out and had some coconut water and mixed drinks.  The beach is very dirty and there are no garbage cans around, so you need to be careful where you step, but still very nice and worth the visit!"
ross m,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2017,Gotta love this spot. Its pretty amazing what they pull together in 30mins. . . and  dont miss the sunset whatever you do. 
Mavis L,40 contributions,Sep 2017,"Beach is clean , no rubbish scattered everywhere near the ocean except the construction on going , also some locals trying to sell handcrafts etc . Good for surfing and sunbathing for sure , other than that nothing much to expect .  "
Eloise T,"Sydney, Australia",Sep 2017,Having drinks while watching the sunset was a highlight. It was a lovely setup with live music. Would easily go back again!
Jason H,4 contributions,Sep 2017,Great evening we had a beautiful sunset and a drink and snacks in a bean bag on the beach for $20 Australian
Jahmin Lerum,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2017,"Nice sand, decent waves, close restaurants and all the easy amenities to make a day at the beach care free and relaxing."
Guyglenda,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2017,"Beautiful restaurant for watching the sunset.  We had tapas and cocktails very enjoyable, prices are over priced which is a shame, as they have music dancing later on in the evening, which is nice, but as i mentioned too expensive!!!! Waitresses are very helpful but they really do push hard for u to keep ordering."
Auz55,68 contributions,Aug 2017,"A beach, just opposite cocoons, a well known venue for the young and the beautiful unfortunately the beach itself has a long dirty drain, running from thr drarnpipe on thr road, and tricklesright down to the beach . Once you have bipassed this area , the beach is beautiful. Come last in the afternoon, Pick out a bean bag chair, and while away the afternoon, whatching the locals play, soccer on the beach, while you settle in with a cocktail. Bliss. "
SanghasUK,"Alton, UK",Aug 2017,This is a nice beach with soft sand but it get's really crowded. My family found that if you travel another 800 metres north it gets less busy and the beach gets wider. You have a more relaxed time.
IndiaTravels97,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2017,"This beach is great for everything - learning how to surf, sunbathing during the day, but we really liked coming to one of the many beach bars to chill out with a drink and watch the skies, or our nightly beach walks. The beach is so long, you can walk as far as you can, away from the noise for some quiet, before heading back to the live music. Really great."
swnj_1701,"Manchester, UK",Aug 2017,Great atmosphere on this beach. Sunsets are beautiful. The swimming can be dangerous because of high waves but fun to play in the shallow areas 
Josh B,5 contributions,Jun 2017,"This beach is very famous, my wife want to go very much. We came during school holiday season. Even though beach was very beautiful, it was too many people, cannot full relax."
xiurongzhang5,"Hangzhou, China",Jul 2017,We love that beach which is so beautiful. The beach is so wider and the weather is so nice. that monment before the sunset I will remember it for ever.
Azean M,9 contributions,Aug 2017,"The best place for beginner surfers, and those who enjoy a good sunset. It's a long stretch so it isn't overly crowded. "
Trish M,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"Great place to enjoy sunset, get there about 4.30 and pick your bar/bean bag, soak up the live music, people watch and generally enjoy !"
Allen Tang,86 contributions,Sep 2017,There are a lot of surfers here otherwise the beach is not overly busy. It is a great spot for beginner surfers.
Katia K,"Barcelona, Spain",Aug 2017,"This beach is perfect if you are a surfer - big waves, lots of surf classes for beginners. However the waves and current are too strong for swimming , so not really suitable for a relaxing day on a beach as you won't be able to get into water (at least during the days when we were there) . Another good time for visiting is sunset time. Amazing! Lots of bars to enjoy the sunset while having a drink/dinner. "
Bianca A,Romania,Aug 2017,"We visited it during low tide so the ocean was very calm and we could have a nice swim. The place is really nice for sunset, even though the restaurants on the beach play music after 5.30 so if you want a quiet sunset you should choose another place. You can find sun beds in this area, but you should definitely bargain with the keepers as they charge you a lot if they see you are foreigner."
Delpiero86,"Radcliffe, UK",Aug 2017,We walked down here as we were staying about 6 or 7 km up the beach. The waves were perfect for surfing. My husband surfed for about 2 and a half hours and I watched and bought some bracelets. The lady sat next to me and handmade the bracelets for me.There was a man selling a crossbow but we didn't buy it as I wasn't sure what airport security would think. Ha ha. And I'm not sure we'd have much use for it.Great surfing. Nice beach. 
Yas,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Aug 2017,"The beach has high waves, which make it good exclusively for surfers, it is forbidden to swim as the waves are quit high.There are some very nice coffee shops and restaurants if you just want to chill out!"
Woosie58,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,I've been in Legian for the last 8 days and have been to the beach everyday. It's a great part of the beach and usually not as many rips as other areas. It's very relaxing to be on a lounge and have the option to be served anything you may desire. It's always good to watch the great surfers and also all the surf schools teaching new ones. It's very easy to join a surf school or simply hire a board and get lessons direct from the hirer. Great part of the beach to be on all day and also stay or come back for a few drinks and sunset.
BUGI_70,"Florence, Italy",Apr 2017,"Capil Beach is a long beach in Seminyak, beside Double Six Beach. Very wide with the low tide. Mostly with sunbeds,  it's quite a touristic spot.  It'd be beautiful if it was cleaner. Surf schools, bars and restaurants.Parking can be a nightmare if you drive a car.  No problem with a motorbike. "
Tam T,2 contributions,Aug 2017,This beach is very crowded even on weekdays. It has a very wide and long sloping beach so it's good to bring your dogs or kids to play. Many food stalls but mostly sell local food but you can find a good pop up cafe on the west side of the beach to chill out with cocktails or softdrinks.
Jessica A,"Barranquilla, Atlantico, Colombia",Aug 2017,you need to rent a bed always need to ask for low price they told me first 120 and then i get it on 80 rupiah
Timothy L,"Market Weighton, UK",Aug 2017,"My partner and I visited the beach as I had read that it was ideal for surfing. Having never surfed before I thought I should have a go. I haggled with the guys to secure a good deal for the sunbeds and surfboard.... so I paid 100,000 IDR for two beds and a surfboard. After having a go with the surfboard and finding it tricky the guy gladly swap it for a body board (not before chuckling to himself) "
nilimag2015,"Mumbai, India",Aug 2017,"Many beach shacks in the area,all alive & with live bands in the evenings. Our hotel had a beach club here too. Many shacks renting/selling surfing boards & related stuff. Many hawkers selling stuff too.The road leading to d beach had sooo many shops selling Ato Z , restaurants, massage centres,parlours..."
Claire N,Australia,Aug 2017,We thoroughly enjoyed our 4 night stay at the Double Six. We paid close to $3500 AUD for our stray and found our time there enjoyable. Our room was the ocean facing and the views were excellent. The Plantation restaurant was incredible and the balcony booths we reserved for the night ensured excellent views while we dined. Highly recommend. 
elliottn,"Cincinnati, OH",Aug 2017,"This beach not that great for swimming or just chilling in the water, but there are surfing lessons and other tourist trappings available. The best feature is the sunset views. Sunsets here can be amazing. It worth renting a bean bag chair and having a few cocktails at sunset. Definitely sunset is best, otherwise nothing great. "
Anthony D,4 contributions,Jan 2017,"There is a fun buzz around this beach. Although its not the whitest sand or the most tranquil, its good to come in the late afternoon with friends."
wayan-btd,"Gianyar, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Viewing sunset or enjoying breeze night wind, this place has them. But the waitress were a kind of bit off, we were receiving our orders 30 minutes later while they so responsive at picking up bule's.A good place to have a overnight chit-chat but should have improved their service consistently without discrimination."
Jo H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2017,"Nice beach lots of people trying to sell things though, just pretend you are asleep and they still wont leave you alone. Like along all the beaches you can hire chairs and surfboards, and have a great day."
Christine P,4 contributions,Aug 2017,Love this beach. It's very clean. Locals selling their ware but don't bother you. Lovely place to watch the sunset 
ThaiTraveller2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2017,"Great beach to  catch up with friends walk along or have a drink or two, a feed or just watch the sunset as many people do"
Emma T,"Bracknell, UK",Aug 2017,"Spent most of a day here just relaxing after a full day of travel. Hired a pair of beds 400,000 (maybe should have negotiated but jet lag was in full swing). Lots of surf schools using the water so no swimming allowed and when I dipped myself in the current was very strong so be careful. As we left around 5, everywhere was setting up for the evening with stages being set up at each bar for live music so I'm sure the evenings will be fun. Not a place to go if after some piece and quiet as was very busy."
Jackielucy,"Mooloolaba, Australia",May 2017,"Yes you guessed it this place is one of the most expensive places to eat or drink in Bali..Dont know why....it is an awfull concrete building no atmoshere at all, the ocean view is great but thats it,be aware also parts of the resort insist on a dress code in some areas........The local bars/restaurants either side of this cold unwelcoming building have the same great views only with a much cheaper price tag on the food & drink that is served & seriously a much brighter & happier constitutioin, it would seem they actually train the staff in this place to be alouf & stuck up "" not sure why you would go to Bali to experience that sort of nonsence?Do you & your wallet a favour & pass on this place for a night out........."
Morten_Nielsen,"Vejle, Denmark",Sep 2016,"For swimming maybee not the best spot, but for surfing or even learning how to surf, a great placeSunbeds however are way to pricy "
christine l,"Napier, New Zealand",Aug 2017,"What a fabulous setting to eat dinner while watching the sun set.Only issue we had was all the people trying to sell us stuff, this went on all night and while I appreciate people in Bali work dam hard to make a living, harder than kiwis could imagine it is not overly pleasant when eating dinner."
Jobine R,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Jul 2017,Good beach but everyday Red Flag for no swimming allowed! Still adults can and are going in!Very strong current and not suitable for young children.Nice relaxing rental beach beds - make a deal for day price ! Lots of beach selling ladies - very expensive so know what you're willing to pay :-)
LindaRuse,"Newcastle, Australia",May 2017,"Great friendly atmosphere where the bars put out bean bag chairs which are so comfortable.  Lovely food, great music and atmosphere."
Jenna R,"New South Wales, Australia",Jul 2017,"My husband and i loved Double Six beach. Beers, good vibes and some sun on a beanbag is the perfect way to spend the afternoon in Bali and watch the sunset.No need to go to pretentious beach clubs (Potato Head) and pay ridiculous prices for a beer or cocktail."
Karthik Shankar,87 contributions,Nov 2016,"Catch some waves, drink some beer, stroll along the beach, watch the sunset, enjoy a game of soccer or lounge in one of the many beachside restaurants and enjoy a night of karaoke. The beach captures everything that is great about Bali, its welcoming, relaxed and just about always having a good time!"
Thomas M,"Sissach, Switzerland",Jul 2017,"Had been at Double six Beach today with the family (2kids 7&10h, and the beach has been perfectly clean. What you need to know is, that from Dec-Mar), the beach is NOT be cleaned, as there is too much garbage coming out of the sea because of the winds. So, you cannot go during that time. This is not because of the Bali garbage, but because of the tide, most coming from Indonesia mainland. From Apr-Nov, the beach is being cleaned daily- sposnored by several large organisations. Only 4 stars, as the beach is pretty crowded wth a lot of low quality beach bars."
Rachel A,Australia,Jul 2017,Great bars/restaurants and amazing spot to kick back and watch the sunsets from the beach. Most bars have seating on the beach and quite often a band playing. Pricing is very affordable.
Steven Lim,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2017,"Visited this stretch of the beach right in front of the Double Six Hotel because our villa happen to have their own beach corner there. Was pleasantly surprised that the beach is wide and clean and not too crowded. We were glad that our villa had their own quality sunbed and shades far superior than those beach vendors' chargeable ones. The waves at places are huge and strong, ideal for the budding surfers but the spot in front of ours was fine for adults. Water is clean though visibility poor. The occasional trinkets vendors can be irritating but they get the message after a few polite rejections. Had a great time here lazing away and dipping in the water. The best part is we had a private outdoor shower to wash up before hitting the shops and eateries of the Double Six area. "
Maritroel,"Horsens, Denmark",Jul 2017,In Semyniak and at the beach you are never bored. There are lots of things to do and see for everybody. 
Andrew H,3 contributions,Jul 2017,This beach is nice.  The regular beach sellers like to target foreigners but are not intimidating.  The black sand stains your clothes and your feet so you might want to wash off when you leave.  The beach has an array of bars and several live bands playing....it almost seems like battle of the bands but sitting in the right place will drown out the sound of nearby bands.
Nickbails9299,"Strathalbyn, Australia",Jun 2017,A clean beach with loads of beds to choose from. Enjoyed watching sunsets and walking.Beware of people just wanting to sell you something - this beach is no exception.Dont forget to by your lantern to let off at night time
Spesh7,"Cork, Ireland",Jul 2017,"We found Paradise ! Absolutely loved every minute of the stay. It was 5 days of bliss ! We got upgraded as it was our honeymoon and we just kived the room ! The balcony was long enough to have and train a football team ha. We also had complimentary drinks and honeymoon welcome upon arrival. It couldn't be anymore professional than it was set up. The bathroom with a tv attached right in front of the bath tub. The shower in both forms shower head and over head tropical fall. The staff so pleasant and ok its part of the job but it just felt more organic than forced. We were late to the pool a few mornings and worried about no sun lounges but the pool and lagoon staff always found room for us. This was a big plus for my new wife as she loves the sun. It would be a disservice to name individuals because every one made the stay so pleasant for us. We dine on the rooftop on day one and the view is something to behold, the view especially at sunset is magical. Plus the food was really good and reasonable compared to irish prices anyway. On our last night we visited the plantation grill bar in the hotel, we stepped in the elevator and stepped out in 1922 New York. It was like the old time Jazz Bars from New York movies. The ambiance, the food, the music, the conpany and the drinks were all top class 5 star rating. A little pricey but well worth the quality. I must mention ""Koma"" our waiter , smiling from ear to ear and when he heard it was our honeymoon well he brought out a plate with happy honeymoon and some specialist chocolates, classy touch. A great guy with great manners and welcoming approach. When we were checking out it all became very real that our stay was our with Double six Bali. Id struggle to say ive been anywhere with better service. We are sad to be leaving here and will hopefully make a return in some years to come as it was just a holistic, spiritual and all round bloody amazing honeymoon !Thank you Audrey and James Claffey "
adisuranto,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2017,A fun place to relax while swimming in the ocean and while enjoying the sunset a delicious meal free of noise
fbsloot,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2017,Scammers around the public toilet block it off and demand a 5000 rupiah payment if you need to use it. What a crap place. People will just end up urinating in the water. First place I've ever visited that needed a payment to relieve yourself. 
Jonathan P,31 contributions,Jul 2017,This beach is always busy. Considering the surge of growth over the past 20yrs. It was the dead end of bali. Now you cant park and is very full. The inlet river to the right is not the best and is sometimes very dirty depending on the day.
Eka Widya Ristanti,"Bekasi, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"Double six the best beach.. the best view, the best in Bali.. come on visit Bali and Denpasar - Indonesia"
garybush,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2017,"The beach at Double Six (Legian) is the best of the beaches running south from Kuta to Seminyak. There is a much larger beach area from the water to the hotels/restaurants etc. The Seminyak beach is steeper and not as much beach area, whilst the beach at Kuta is just too busy.South of Double Six road is Legian, lots of beach bars and restaurants, north of Double Six and there are a number of low end restaurants selling Indo food, burgers etc,"
Nicki H,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2017,"Go visit Made Kolu's Beach Bar. Made is so helpful & provides great beach beds, surf lessons, cocktails, cold drinks & a great fun vibe - he's our go to guy at the beach. Whilst they all provide a similar experience at Double Six - I think Made goes the extra mile."
Shereenq,"Danube-Auen National Park, Austria",Jul 2017,"The beach is great , lots of space and many seats to choose from if u come early . Around 50 for a seat. We spent the whole day, the kids had a blast as one of them rented a boogie board for 50 full day and our son went for the surf class -1 1/2 hours for 250 with one of small shacks renting out gear- he got to keep the surf board to practice all day. We asked for rip curl however you had to book a day in advance and pay 1000000 for the lesson . The guyWas great and spent most of the day giving him tips. The only downside was all the sellers insisting we buy their things. Spectacular sunset."
Terry H,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2017,"We walked along this beach a couple of times and couldn't help notice that the surfers were coming right in among the swimmers.Having said that, it is and has long been known as a surfing area.I won't swim where there are surfboards.Having said that, it is a lovely beach to walk on. The sand feels good and if you walk where the water washes up, the temperature of the water is perfect.There are also no shortage of hotel restaurants at which you can stop at if you've got your wallet on you."
Isabella R,192 contributions,Mar 2017,"You need to pay a small fee to rent an umbrella or a reclining chair and relax though. Nothing is free in Bali 😂The beach, however, is much cleaner and quieter than Kuta, which led to the 5 star! My local friend recommended this beach too, and he was right. It's not far from the city center, and quite well-maintained! :)"
james c,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2017,"Beers served to your beach chair, ladies attending to you for pedicure and manicure. Simple folks who leave you alone when you say no to any hawker goods politely. "
robj69,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jul 2017,Large beach mostly clean. Beware of steam run off avoid it go a little south water cleaner. Good waves for surfing & body surfing
PhixyBoy,3 contributions,Jul 2017,"This place good for family if they want to learn surfing.Many surfing school here and they was professional. We happy the surfing instructor good in English, so we can have fast learning.And this place good for waiting sunset"
Ali K,25 contributions,Jul 2017,"Surfing was especially good here, and there are many restaurants located on the road parallel to the beach.  Ideal for starting a long beach walk all the way down to Kuta.  Closer to sunset, all the beachside cafes take out their bean bag chairs and set them on the sand.  Great vibe and atmosphere especially for sunset and continuing on throughout the night with live music!!!! must see!"
Monica F,"Bergen, Norway",Jul 2017,Rented surf boards in Europe earlier - but ended up paddling the water. Great surf schools and perfect waves made it possible for all ten of us to surf the waves in just two hours. Amazing! 
Venkitasubramanian,"Kalpetta, India",Jul 2017,"The beach is live all the time, nice place to take a sun bath , spend the complete day with couple of beer, lot of restaurants nearby "
Linda M,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jun 2017,Great night on the beach watching the sunset while drinking cocktails and getting a foot rub. Loved the atmosphere the people and the band while sitting in the comfy beanbags.
jalsakaro,"Leicester, UK",Jun 2017,Double Six Beach is one of best beaches in Bali. It has fine sands throughout and no stones to hurt your feet. It is great for surfing and swimming. The local lads who teach surfing were great and could speak good English. The beach also has lots of eating places and the food both veg and non veg was good. Prices for the drinks were also reasonable and if you ordered if while lying on your sunbed via the boys who were serving it was tax free and no service charge payable.Cold Fresh Coconut were excellent and so was the local Bintang beer. After seeing other beaches in Bali I am of the opinion that Double Six Beach was the best one around.
JosephLairdFriel,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,"This is a nice wide open beach with minimal sunbeds, so no to overcrowdrd. There are a lot of sellers on the beach and you be repeatedly hassled by them to buy some of their rubbish or even worse allow them to massage your legs and feet. They can and do get annoyed if you don't support them by buying something.The sunbeds were $10 for 2 beds but this was dependant on how long you wanted it, what time of day and who the boy was selling the idea to you. Once you have secured a price expect nothing else from the boy, even if your being hassled by the sellers  they won't get involved.Overall I think the beach is OK but many many people just  bring a Towel and sit on the beach.... mostly the younger people. The sea looked safe enough for the kids but I would advise supervision as the waves can get big and powerful. As i said my day at the beach was nothing special. I've certainly been to better beaches with better,nicer facilities and amenities."
tsm85990,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2017,"Was here is June 2017 and was a great place to pass the time watching the waves, people and drinking a nice beer or three."
Akbar R,"Tehran, Iran",Jun 2017,Its very crowded and not very clean beach but its middle beach for resting.its nice at nights and the prices are good
jss359,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2017,We walked from Double Six to Potato Head. A lovely walk in the ever-present breeze. But it's sad to see such a beautiful location scattered with plastic debris. The debris created mainly by the very reason the beach ( and other areas ) needs to be clean - tourism and all the people and industries that sustain it.There's a simple solution to some of the pollution - the government should ban the single use plastic bags and have a monetary incentive for recycling soft plastics. 
thejabours,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2017,Good for a surf during the day and by night beach shacks playing live accoustic cover songs where you can chill with a cocktail on a bean bag. 
gosia L,3 contributions,Jun 2017,Nice spa and bar I really enjoying my time. and the service was excellent and the drinks were lovely. The pool is great and the staff were very nice! 
tango122008,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jun 2017,"We came here on a whim, as it was still early to go elsewhere. Enjoyed the walk along the beach, the eye candy, and dogs frolicking in the sand and sea. Watch the surfers or learn to surf as there are plenty of shops offering lessons, and to 'hang out with Bali boys'. There are deck chairs or bean bags available for rent, so nice comfortable sunbathing places, or you could bring your own towel too."
alexia5r,10 contributions,Jun 2017,This place does not get enough credit!! So glad we found this place. Awesome to watch the sun go down with live music and awesome drinks and food. Sitting on bean bags on white sand with candles is picture perfect. 100% worth the trip! 
Diswank,"Queensland, Australia",Jun 2017,I first travelled to bali in the 70s. It's just such a shame the locals don't take care of the rubbish situation. The government needs to step up and help with this problem. It's a sad state of affairs. One of Bali's biggest attractions- the beach! Has become overloved. It is not a tourist problem it needs to be addressed at local levels. Indonesia needs to step up and take responsibility for their own environmental problems. Tourists come from countries where we are educated to sustain a clean environment. The education system needs to address this asap.  
Salina A,38 contributions,Jun 2017,"Great pool, bar and spa but pricey. I enjoyed my day there. The service was great and the drinks were lovely. The pool is great and the staff were attentive. I enjoyed the spa but it's on the pricey end! Much higher than other hotels in the area. It was lovely though but I'm not sure it warranted the price overall. "
Sarah B,"Queensland, Australia",May 2017,"We loved this beach for the sunset view, didn't surf or swim as we had young kids-but loved having a drink on the bean bag chairs and enjoyed the beautiful sunset!  A must!"
Chris C,"Noosa, Australia",May 2017,"Standard long Kuta style beach. One of the better surf spots because of a stream, but that was polluted - not so nice. Locals (friendly ones) dominate in the surf so hard for intermediate surfers to get waves. Surf schools, etc."
Jessie M,"Calgary, Canada",Jun 2017,The beach is beautiful and there's plenty of comfortable loungers available. There are lots of people trying to sell everything you can imagine and it can be a little overwhelming. Everything that is being sold on the beach is at an inflated price. Just a warning. Two beach chairs can be rented for $5 CAD per day but you have to negotiate. There is a rip tide and no swimming signs posted all along the beach but there were hundreds of people in the water. It's OK. for surfing and chilling in the water near the shore but I wouldn't go for a swim there.Surf lessons and board rentals can be bought for $30-35 for a two hour rental and board for the day. 
Putuwais,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2017,"It is a busy beach, especially in the afternoon. You could spend a good time here with you best friend with having pizza or drink. The are many food shop here."
IanTwee,"Durban, South Africa",May 2017,"After the disappointment of Seminyak Beach, Double 6 is a different scene altogether.  There are good restaurants along the beach, sun umbrellas and surf ""schools"" galore.  A good spot to be active or just watch the world go by."
Richard W,"Greater London, UK",May 2017,"Double Six Beach is a very beautiful, relaxed beach within easy walking distance of most Seminyak hotels and villas.  I am lucky enough to live in Seminyak and regularly walk along the beach. There are a variety of bars, restaurants on the beach front with beach umbrellas and beach cushions.There are many sunbed opportunities at reasonable daily rates. Live music, surfing classes, surf and sunshine. What more could you wish for. Highly recommend."
Peteski2016,"Larnaca, Cyprus",Apr 2017,Lots to do on this centrally located beach with great bars - we went to Double 6 Rooftop and then The Sands - lots of surfing and a beautiful beach - nice beach to walk and lots of bars etc. if you want to take a break
skpatel,"Vadodara District, India",May 2017,Worth visiting... Take beach view room... Very good break fast. Veg preferences available. Very very cooperative staff.. Thanks to Mr. Vincent pillai n special thanks to Sari for serving with beautiful smile 
Luis C,"New York City, NY",May 2017,it's more of a surfers beach....waves are impressive!!spacious quiet beach (unlike Katu beach) with many kiosks serving local and western food and drinks...if you're a sun worshipper and looking for quiet and relaxation then this is the beach for you!
Army1962,"London, UK",Feb 2017,"we did love just to walk on that beach . Lots of little places , very relaxed vibe. We will def be back "
Vicki T,3 contributions,Apr 2017,Sand is black and hard.the surf is quite rough but the bars at the beach are alot of fun and cheap.stick to the hotel swimming pools or head off to coccon beach club 
Mel4178,"Brisbane, Australia",May 2017,We stayed at the Double Six Luxury Hotel.  We chose not to swim in the water at the beach as it was very dirty - we swam in the Hotel pool.  There are some great beach bars in this area and they are a lot of fun and many have entertainment.   Great place to watch the sunset.
Janine010,"Rangiora, New Zealand",May 2017,"If there wasn't so many hawkers, this would be perfect. Nice to come down in the evening and have some drinks on a bean bag and watch the sunset."
Viktor P,7 contributions,Mar 2017,"Nice beach for surfing, relaxing and long walking over a day and night. Lot of beach bars with cheap prices and nice exotics restourants on the evening."
June H,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2017,What a great atmosphere sitting with your feet in the sand having a cold drink watching the sun do down after another beautiful day in Bali.  
Kirst F,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2017,Great wide open beach but rough seas. Great for surfers. Too many locals hassle you to buy stuff and sun beds are not free 
Nomadman411978,"London, UK",May 2017,"Double Six Beach is more crowded than the neighboring beaches probably because it has more bars, sun-beds etc. so if that's what you're looking for then this is the place for you. With that come the traders and the sea is not that good."
Riki S,1 contribution,May 2017,"this beach is  located in legian area. In here we can find many restaurant and bar.It is nice to come here on sunset time, drink a beer and enjoy the reggae music by the beach boys..."
Peter T,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2017,"A nice clean beach with sun lounges provided by the drink vendors. I settled in under an umbrella with a nice guy keeping my drinks coming as required. I asked him to keep away the pushy locals trying to give you massages, magic mushrooms etc. and he was really good at maintaining my privacy. The sunset was a bonus."
Gyorgy Sipos,"Exeter, UK",May 2017,Beach is ok just if you are white/tourist they actually hunting for you just to rip you off not the nicest experience
Steve T,5 contributions,May 2017,Double six has some good waves at moment where the stream flows out. Unfortunately recent rain has turned the water brown and stanky. Try not to drink lol. Best mid to high tide. 
Fred W,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"It is really disappointing to see what unregulated development has done to what is potentially a spectacular beach. There is clearly an infrastructure problem which sees streams dumping all sorts of rubbish directly into the sea. This impacts water quality as well as dumps all sorts of plastic rubbish on the beach. This is the dark side of tourism laid bare, and one which all tourists must take some responsibility for. Having said that there are still great opportunities to enjoy the amenity of the beach, watch a great sunset and contribute positively to the environment."
t0ngdee,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2017,Many people were surfing and the crowd was good. A lot of beach benches around as well. Good to take a stroll from here
Sharon L,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,"Fabulous clean beach, gorgeous sunsets Great beach ""bars"" for pre dinner drinks watching the amazing sunsets"
jimypeny2,australia,Apr 2017,As a result of the previous day's rain (we were told) the water turned a hideous brown every so often which prevented us from swimming.  We had one days swimming in the 8 nights we were there.  Fortunately double six had a pool.The view of the sea is always soothing though.  The people selling trinkets were kind enough to leave us alone. I would recommend going to the other side of Bali if you were after clean and clear sea water
Prince Isher,"New Delhi, India",Apr 2017,"Fairly clean beach with lot of restaurants, spas and shopping stores near by. Excellent for morning walk."
Islam K,"Cairo, Egypt",Apr 2017,The sea view was nice with nice weather but it wasn't clean in many places and there was dogs I liked the idea of sitting a while in front the sea but didn't like the idea of swimming there 
Tracey P,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Apr 2017,We stayed at luxury double 6.  The beach directly in front is dirty.  The water is brown and we were told that this was from the rains.  We were here 5 days and it never rained and the water never changed.  The beach is filthy and something should be done to clean it up.  Plastic is washed up everyday.  Coming from NZ where we have such beautiful beaches this is a disappointment and a serious problem.  If a beach is what you want then find somewhere else.  We came to experience everything and had a beautiful pool at our hotel so enjoyed it anyway.  Sunset on the beach is my favorite time 🌤
Bryan D,"Gold Coast, Australia",Apr 2017,"Beah was dirty, with toxic materials (similar to orange paint) causing beach closure. Further down (+ a km) beach was open, but couch hire (offered at exhorbitant rates - negotiate down from A$20 ph) only option - and couches were as clean as the beach. Walk down, swim between the (infrequent) flags, and head back to the hotel pool."
Vanessa P,"Surbiton, UK",Apr 2017,Nice beach but you can't really swim in the sea. Nicer than semiyak beach for sure. We paid 2000000 rupas for two beds and umbrella. It was ok for a while but too hot for a long time and a bit expensive. Look like it really comes alive for sunset and kuta was definitely cheaper than semiyak. 
SamD3030,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,The waves are great but the sand and the first 40 metres or so of the water are not so nice. You can only guess why the water is so brown and there is so much rubbish embedded in the sand. Hopefully the island will improve this over time. 
Peter L,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2017,"There are better beaches in Bali than Seminyak, even in Kuta at the rear of the Centro Shopping centre looks better."
KDPop,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,The issues with this beach is the amount of bars and businesses operating on it. There is filth and grime everywhere. The ocean itself has various plastic objects floating around the shore at all times. I know this is a local money maker but the impact on local conservation is alarming. A clean beach brings other forms of income too. 
Michelle,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2017,Fairly clean beach a popular spot so quite busy hard to get a photo without other people in the background we went at sunset so perhaps not so busy during the day
Michael_Teoh,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,One of the stunning and beautiful beach at Seminyak area. Need go inside ally and cross over some building just can reached the beach. 
KATY P,"Kincumber, Australia",Feb 2017,This beach is nice and clean.  Sometimes a bit rough but overall an enjoyable day out spent here.  Some amazing hotels and restaurants here.  If you need to find it our driver Putu at fair dinkum transport (on tripadvisor) was a great driver and can show you exactly where To go.  
rosemoo12,"Sweden, ME",Apr 2017,The restaurant had variety for dinner. Sunset was one of the best sunsets. Do not swim here! Should be nice for relaxing too
CoisDeZweed,"Bergen op Zoom, The Netherlands",Apr 2017,"The sea has nice waves here. Good spot to learn how to surf.It is not possible to swim at all areas, only between the flags. The sea is very rough and there is a strong current.Budget bar available at your left hand side when entering the beach. You can recognize this because they have crappy old chairs with a frozen image on it and only a cooler with drinks and also coconuts. These guys are very nice.Enjoy!"
Mr_Nobody_1979,"Krakow, Poland",Apr 2017,"One of many around Kuta Beach, but less crowded than southern neighbor. Quite a lot of umbrellas and seats for rent available with a friendly locals providing tourists with snacks and drinks. Few good restaurants available just outside. "
Michele3062,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,Great at night to listen to live music all types of trios playing Casual bean bags to sit in enjoy a drink or some sisha Great for families teens adults 
Adrienne M,"Johannesburg, South Africa",Apr 2017,"Lots of beach bars and restaurants, good service and umbrellas and loungers easy to get, surf schools and surf board hire. Go for walks, swim or wait for the sunset parties. Music, beach soccer, volleyball, or watch the planes land on the island! Could be cleaner and dog owners should be made to pick up after their own dogs. "
Seaside46221,11 contributions,Apr 2017,"We took the extended family down to Double Six Beach to watch the sunset. Ages from 7 to 55. Grabbed beanbags at the Blue 9 Beach bar and settled in with drinks and pizzas to watch  the sunset and catch a few tunes. Very touristy, crowded with restaurants many with  music competing and if you are in a large group keep tabs on your bill, keep it simple and pay as you go is my tip. Accept it for what it is and you'll enjoy yourselves as we did."
leedskat,"Shadwell, UK",Apr 2017,I was really disappointed with this beach. There is loads of rubbish and overall a but grotty. There are loads of dogs roaming around just doing their business everywhere so was worried where I was walking. At sunset there is quite a nice buzz but overall it didn't live up to what I was expecting.
Karen_P2012,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2017,If you are used to living in a country with beautiful white sandy clean beaches then prepare to be a little bit shocked.  
vicri1607,"Bali, Indonesia",Mar 2017,Double six beach is famous....especially for sunset in seminyak area. The wave quite good for surfing even sometimes there is no wave (depend on season). U can enjoy ur sunset with drink or small bites...especially there is bakso there... there is so many small warung to chill out with standart price so dont worry.. so many locals or tourist to come here enjoy the sunset.... So dont miss it if u come to Bali..this place u must visit.. cheerrrsss
CrystaNatalie,"Orchard Road, Singapore",Feb 2017,"Love this beach, clean and nice sunset. Every afternoon we stayed here to drink beer and enjoyed nice sunset"
larrym0527,"Camas, Washington",Mar 2017,"Easy access beach with beautiful people, good surfing.  Water is very warm, shallow and safe for all ages."
Wahyus69,"Kuta, Indonesia",Mar 2017,Me and my wife were enjoy the beach and specially the cocktail so nice and refreshing combined with sunset on the horizon was great feeling   
Mal T,33 contributions,Mar 2017,"This part of the beach is nice with lots of cafe's and restaurants along the foreshore.   You can sit and watch the world go by in any one of these places.  Excellent place for sunsets.At night a number of the restaurants have live music and they set up tables, chairs and bean bags under lights on the sand.   Very nice. When we were there the waves were huge (great to watch) but that meant the ocean was not really swimmable."
vickyvic,36 contributions,Jan 2017,just a regular beach nothing great about this. more beaches in bali are better than this one. but not crowded
pingsjin3,"London, UK",Mar 2017,I really enjoy to spend time at evening/night at Double beach.Nice live music as well.Very chilling!
KayaOtah,"Singapore, Singapore",Mar 2017,"Instagram likes to boast it with colorful seats and all, but the band wasnt really great, the beach wasnt pristine, i think W beach was better. "
Mike B,"Newcastle upon Tyne, UK",Mar 2017,"This beach is filthy. So much garbage, even broken glass in the sand. It can be dangerous to walk barefoot. The sand is also a dirty grey. Not nice to look at, not nice to walk, overall terrible."
Roland D,"London, UK",Mar 2017,"The sea needs to be kept cleaner!   It had a greenish-brown tinge.  It was warm, though.  There are eateries and places to have massage.  You can rent loungers at 100,000 rupiah."
Natashya A,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"The view is great. It was not that crowded that time. However, I still prefer to go to beach clubs than the beach alone."
tridiana34,"Bandung, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"like to spend the evenings in this location, enjoying the sunset. The beach is big and you can go for long walks but it is also very touristy and noisy and which was not a very nice experience."
Kris Sugiarto,"Pandaan, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"Perfect ambiance for family/couple afternoon walk. Don't forget to enjoy your time at some local cafe, sitting on the sand chair, order some pizza or beverages. Enjoy the air, the sound of waves, and the sun set! :D"
Lee T,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2017,We just picked our way between all the disgusting garbage bought in by the tide.  Not conducive to wanting to sit and drink etc.
SarahNJosh,"Midland, Australia",Mar 2017,"We had a lovely walk along double six beach after a nice meal at The Plantation Grill, would have stopped for a drink if we weren't so full from dinner "
euphorialicexz,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2017,"The place was smelly, and had rubbish strewn around. The sands were rough and grey, and the water was grey too. I've seen better beaches, so so disappointing!The beach clubs were more of a party-crowd place, and not really a place to relax. I went with my friend, just 2 of us girls. While we were walking around we were picked on by the locals there, cat-calling and being stared at. Didn't enjoy ourselves. but we noticed those who were in groups or with male companions, did not face such a problem. I think it's more of a surfer's paradise."
sonny222013,"Mount Maunganui, New Zealand",Mar 2017,"Loads of beach bars pull out their bean bags and umbrellas for sunset and crank the music up. It;s noisy and a bit chaotic but fun and relaxing all the same. Enjoy a drink,watch the waves and the sun go down."
losakos,"Loma Linda, CA",Mar 2017,Went to this beach with some misgivings after reading reviews. Sand was clean when we got there so that's nice! You can lounge under an umbrella with chairs as long as you purchase drinks from the guy whose territory it is. We sat at Monkey Bars. Super nice guy! Had drinks waiting for you as soon as you were done with the one in your hand. Water was deliciously warm. Bad parts? Trash EVERYWHERE in the water. So sad the amount of trash this ocean has. Plus the hawkers are very aggressive and are constantly coming up to you. Nonstop!!! 
Bintang Soepoetro,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2017,"Nice place for seeing sunset. The beach is clean, clear sea water. Suitable for kids and family.Nice places for beer and snacking. However food is overpriced.Been here for two times, March 2016 and 2017"
Eve S,"St Andrews, Australia",Mar 2017,Wasn't impressed with Double 6 beach coz it was grey sand. I was surprised Kuta beach had white sand but still not as white as Australia's Huskinson Beach. 
Christine S,3 contributions,Mar 2017,"Great bars for day and evening relaxing. Food and drink are excellent value and the service is fantastic.  Sit on the bean bags outside the bars or sit inside in the day time for cooler air. Its gets hot out there.  Would highly recemmend a visit with friends, or even alone> people are friendly and you will not be short of conversation."
Pussycatmafia,"Auckland, New Zealand",Mar 2017,Pop down to the beach and lay on the lounger while the staff cater for your every need...Umbrellas great service.. Love it.
Alex Valentin,10 contributions,Feb 2017,"Nice Beach to chill at the beach, a bit dirty probably because the rainy season. A lot of places to grab a drink and enjoy sunset.!"
FunkyMarshmallow,"Bournemouth, UK",Mar 2017,"This is one of the most disgustingly dirty beaches I have ever seen and I have travelled. The amount of rubbish washed up on the beach and not cleared away is a disgrace and an example of the crisis our oceans are suffering.  Why anyone would want to come and sit on it and look out at the rubbish is beyond me and why any Aussie would come from the beautiful beaches in Australia to surf here is crazy.  I went for an early morning run and had to wash my trainers after because I ran through the streams that led into the sea, the smell was so bad, god knows what is in that water and now in the sea."
Suraj B,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2017,"just a beautiful beach, with a  wide area to walk enjoy the sunset, breeze and moonlight. plenty of cafes to choose from with varying genre of music to suit all taste buds. and some live music as well. was a peach."
Jenry D,"Klotten, Germany",Feb 2017,"Beautiful Beach, but it was kinda dirty. A lot of Plastic rubbish on the beach. Maybe it was very very bad Weather for 4 days.But I hope they will clean it.On Sunday was very crowded, many local people as well, they played football on the beach.Otherwise we love the beach."
muldoonchris,"Gold Coast, Australia",Mar 2017,Great beach front restaurants that allow you to lounge on bean bag chairs while watching the sunset.Food was off good quality at fair prices. Not as many hawkers as Kuta and Legian
Danpau,"Glasgow, UK",Mar 2017,"Very long beach, plenty of bed and places to drink.Pestered a lot by people selling stuff or trying to get you to select their beds.No place to shower or even rinse your feet.Lot of stray dogs aboutLots of debris on the beach, including animal dirt!!!Could do with serious clean up.No life guards on beach at all, slough coloured warning flags posted throughout."
Aashish Chauhan,"Greater London, UK",Aug 2016,"There are many restaurant and bars that setup in the evening which play live music while you lounge on large bean bags under a umbrella while being next to the beach.  Lovely place to be, highly recommended."
Faye S,Australia,Jun 2016,Excellent hotel...went out of their way to make our stay an amazing experience.  When the room we were allocated was too noisy we asked if possible we could be moved.  Not a problem ....and we were very lucky to get an upgrade so we were very happy.
Jade C,6 contributions,Feb 2017,"A beach that would've been so relaxing and a great spot for us, however during wet season it was littered as far as the eye could see with washed up plastic and rubbish. Even walking you could see it in the waves as well. We were asked for 100.000IDR for two beach seats for an hour, others offered less but I assume it was a busy time. Plenty of bars and loungers around if you've come from far.Great spot for the day but watch the trash season, we didn't swim at all.Visited February 2017"
gailchapman,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2017,"Disappointing with the hawkers constantly harassing you to buy something every 2minutes. Sunset was lovely however the area did smell unpleasant. Hired the deck chairs/umbrellas for $7AUD for two people for the afternoon, but the first person to approach asked us for $25AUD. Still, the $7 was probably by no means a bargain, neither were the prices any of the hawkers offered, be they for goods or services. "
Heather B,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2017,So nice and peaceful. Very relaxing siting on bean bags. Could easily have fallen asleep. Will visit again 
Lucy B,13 contributions,Feb 2017,"Large busy beach, not white sand if that's what your hoping for. Lots of bars along the beach and sun loungers available during the day, bean bags in the evening. We came in the set season so there is litter deposited on the beach constantly. This does rather spoil it, though there are sections of much cleaner sand and clear blue sea. There are sellers constantly trying to sell their wares. This is a lovely beach to sit and watch the sunset. For a day at the beach I would rather go to nusa dua, we may have been lucky but it was very quiet, no sellers and very clean! "
ClaireT79,"Phuket, Thailand",Feb 2017,"This beach is dirty and very busy every 10 steps you are approached by people, who are nice and friendly but who want to sell you a  bed. After 10 minutes we had to get off the beach. This might be fun in the evening but not so nice during the day. Definatly not a pretty beach if you like nice beaches do not go here in rainy season they have a serious rubbish problem and while the goverment is trying by cleaning 3 times a day, in rainy season sadly it seems a lost cause."
Michael C,182 contributions,Nov 2016,"This is a great beach for simply hanging out, so many chilled bars to stop by with everything from coffees to fruit juices to everyones favourite tipples!As far as going in the sea, be careful, depending on tides the sea can unfortunately be full of rubbish and waste, its very bad and a big example of why we should all be a bit more eco! It was certainly a wake up call for us but dont let that put you off enjoying the wonderful beach and the brilliant vibrance of the sunsets, all the bars come alive with singing acts, djs and more, find yourself everything from a massive beanbag to a comforable couch, kick back and enjoy"
Chris C,"Honolulu, HI",Feb 2017,This section of the beach is more well maintained than adjoining ares along the beach front. There is a more visible effort to remove the trash from the evening before prior to morning visitors arriving. All in all the beaches in Bali are average at best. These are not the powdery sand beaches other places have to offer. The sand is more gritty and course.
Marcus O,6 contributions,Dec 2016,"this is the best beach compared to Kuta...great for familys and groups,many very friendly beach bars that will cater to almost whatever you want..swimming is great for little and big kids..has surf life savers on duty all day,many delicious cheap local food stalls and easy to get to..the sunsets are awsome and after there are some great restaurants to choose a place for dinner..safest beach in my oppinion for swimming"
rowanc932,33 contributions,Feb 2017,"Went down and walked along this beach, had some decent size waves. Surfers everywhere offering you surf lessons which is nice if you wanted to learn. There are seats everywhere which cost to sit on them and charge by the hour which I think it cost roughly 50,000 for 1hr. Good to check out but quite a busy beach! Be careful when swimming as the current is super strong! Would recommend checking this place out!"
buaya40,"The Hague, The Netherlands",Feb 2017,"The beach has black sand and is not so cozy as is described in the leaflets. Although separated from the main area, sellers of all kind of products annoyingly demand attention for their merchandise."
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Feb 2017,"Without doubt probably the busiest of all the Bali beaches.This is where you will find your more formal beach bars where you can get a comfy bean bag to sit on , a cocktail in your hand whilst nibbling on tasty tapas.Not as many beach sellers up this way as Kuta in the south but plenty more eateries up this end of town , many of which have good lighting to set the mood for a relaxing or romantic night out."
Off their P,"Manchester, UK",Feb 2017,"This is one of the busier beaches in the area and that brings both pluses and minuses. Because there are some nice hotels around the prices in shops and restaurants and to be dearer than in other areas and it does get very busy. Having said that, it also means a lot of facilities for you to enjoy and we had some great fun there. There is lots to do whether you want exercise or relaxation – you can hire sun beds with umbrellas quite cheaply. There are many places to eat of a good quality and we also used it for exercise by having fast walks along it. "
Geet,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2017,The water was not the cleanest. Overall a nice beach experience however I was expecting a lot more off it
caserj,"Dallas, Texas",Feb 2017,.. Beach is good... several good beach bars.. B9B is a good one right there at Double Six Road.  Lots of good restaurants and some good shopping.
Kyksta,Singapore,Feb 2017,"Love double 6 beach, always pay a visit when we are in Bali. My 4 kids had a 2 hour surf lesson there and absolutely loved it. Restaurants and great market/ shops near by. Then you have Jalan Legian/seminyak which is full of cool shops. Highly recommended 😊"
Bernadette B,"Queensland, Australia",Feb 2017,"A very cool trendy bar. Overlooks the ocean, fabulous for sunset drinks or a night out. Especially love the pods!"
Toby Cheong,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,restaurants are plentiful for you to choose from and they are quite despo at times.very relaxing by the beach watching the sunset but the beach was rather dirty and not much cleaning.
Lovetravelling57,"Karratha, Australia",Jan 2017,"We enjoy sitting on the bean bags listening to the music, watching the sunset! The hawkers are rather annoying and should know when to leave you alone!"
Emily W,10 contributions,Jul 2016,Good for sun but and nice experience in double six beach . The location . Restaurant close by fantastic 
Collins2402,"Warialda, Australia",Jan 2017,Was filthy the day we went and the beach was littered with rubbish.Iam sure its not like this all the time.
Deborah T,"South Fremantle, Australia",Jan 2017,Stay away. Run by Javanese gangs.  Scary place and not safe for tourists. Syringe found on beach. Murdered policeman found here on beach in August last year. 
Miss Afianty,23 contributions,Feb 2017,Nice and closest beach to my place. Good place to hangout and just have a sit by the beach. Should try the famous bakso (meatballs).
Victoria E,8 contributions,Feb 2017,Just dark sand. Nothing special to say about this beach. Good for a walk. No way to swim in this dirty water. Nice to sit and watch the waves from the bar.
Sandy B,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2017,"This beach is very dirty and really only good for sunsets, rubbish everywhere and your constantly hassled by people trying to sell you something. The sand is dirty and almost black! "
Rima EK,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Dec 2016,"The beach is big, nothing I haven't seen before. The sunset was rewarding for the pictures taken. It's a nice place to sit and relax but the highlight of my day here was learning how to surf. A sports I never knew was so difficult yet I loved it and would do it all over again! If you come here, make sure to learn it, it's worth it!"
tonyneville23,"Ballarat, Australia",Jan 2017,"The beach was dirty and covered in litter probably due to the rains, some bars were okay but an excessive amount of people selling trinkets . Even though this is their lively hood when you say no it means no and leave me alone."
Taipei921,Singapore,Jan 2017,"A private beachfront shared on a wide expanse of beach with strong waves. Many surfing instructors dot the beach touting their expertise. Beach washes up a huge amount of sand bed, which colored the waves with brown sediments while the waves further out are blue. Nice for sunsets and strolling, though the filth and debris washed ashore this time of year spoilts the prestine beach image. Not suitable for swimming, especially with the sand in the waves and the strong waves now (red flags warning).Free towel, beach chair, and ice cold mineral water for guests of Double Six and Courtyard Seminyak. Friendly attendant John."
DarwinWendy,Darwin,Jan 2017,"I like to spend the evenings in this location, enjoying the sunset while listening to live music and consuming a few bintangs. Ca be a bit annoying with people trying to sell you things however with a simple no they usually leave you alone."
lululaura1234567,"Montreal, Canada",Aug 2016,"The beach is big and you can go for long walks but it is also very touristy and noisy and we saw a lot of trash on the beach, which was not a very nice experience."
Madeleine W,96 contributions,Jan 2017,"We went for stroll along tis beach on our first day considering it was very close to our villa. Honestly, not the worst beach but definitely not the cleanest. I can imagine when it's peak season, it is saturated with tourist and locals alike so there would be a lot of rubbish and coming here in January which is wet season, the daily rain and some down pours doesn't help with making the beach dirtier. Each beach side cafe/restaurant have the same beach set up with umbrellas, bean bags and tables on the beach and a set up in the middle facing the venue for live performers to entertain. "
The Yum L,556 contributions,Dec 2016,"In general all the beaches along this side of Bali are not particularly clean. When you've come from pristine Australian waters, these beaches cannot compare. There are great surf schools, a long stretch of beach, and lots of beach bars and cafes along the edge though which make up for the lack of cleanliness."
John M,"Parkland, FL",Jan 2017,"It's there & nice to walk along--but, you spend a lot of time watching where you step. The trash is everywhere. JUst NOT pleasant! "
AAlnazawi,18 contributions,Jan 2017,What made me sad is the amount of trash along the beach but overall the beach was great and sunset was one of the best sunsets i ever seen 
John T,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,As a beach person I can only advise that I have never seen a more polluted beach or water as here. Do not swim is my advise.
scost67,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Loved the cleanliness of the property! Our room was everything we were expecting and more! Great view! The restaurant had variety for dinner and the staff are always  more than willing to help where they can! Can't wait to go back 
Chrisjech,Surabaya,Jan 2017,"The conditions of the beach is not well maintained, there are a lot of plastic waste, empty bottle drink, food wrappers were brought on shore. Besides, this place is a nice for beginner to learn how to surf. "
Grazia C,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"The beach here is typical of beaches on this side of Bali, lovely for a walk or run, just dipping your toes or good for experienced surfers. Beware of the tow! The most positive aspect of this beach is watching the glorious sunsets and the fact that local Balinese families sometimes use  this beach to conduct traditional religious Ceremonies. The Ceremonies can be a rewarding cultural experience to observe ( in an unobtrusive and respectful manner).I have read some of the other reviews and from time to time the area can become quite polluted, although I understand that in recent years, local hotels pay to have the beaches cleaned regularly and there seems to be much more pride in the way the beaches are maintained."
1310greg,"Darwin, Australia",Jan 2017,"If you want to relax, swim, buy a beer and enjoy a sun lounge - this beach is the best.  Choose a bar opposite Furama and the ladies have a great, easy toilet option that will meet with first world approval.The hawkers soon realise what you are into and what not - a simple 'tidak, tidak' (no, no) generally means: ""not interested, go away""."
LindyHaynes,"Geelong, Victoria, Australia",Dec 2016,we visited in the December 2016... obviously there was a current that bought all the rubbish mainly plastic onto the beaches... you really couldn't swim or sit on the beach at all... was even too scared to be bare feet... I have never seen to much plastic in all my life... even though there were workers and tractors day in and day out.. the mess kept coming in....
JorgeLuisHM,779 contributions,Dec 2016,This beach is almost for surfers only; as other travelers have written most of the public beaches are so filthy!; good opportunity to take a bite or beverage to enjoy sunset and nightlife.
Andrew D,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,Nice beach (for Bali) with the usual small bars and chairs/tables/umbrellas which is cleaned in the morning of debris (i.e. rubbish).  The touts come regularly selling the usual stuff.  Beware of the prices (cut the first price by 80% at least).  Cold beer can be had for about 20k-30k.
Alan F,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"I was shocked to see a beach that dirty- empty bottles and cans are scattered around, not a very nice walk on that beach. Can't go there with little kids! Also, can't swim because of waves, but looks like to be good for surfing - surfers seemed like having fun. "
Sazza,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2017,"The beaches are lined with rubbish and litter everywhere. A real shame really. A lot of locals trying to sell you things too, which is ok, but gets really annoying when you're trying to chill and they won't leave you alone. "
Al Ross,"Vientiane, Laos",Jan 2017,"66 is a great place to hangout and have a few cheap drinks in the sun, before heading off to a restaurant or bars for the evening.Please note the recent comments stating the beach is covered in litter is a yearly event at this time of the year due to the predominant wind direction. Yes; the beach has more litter on it at this time of the year due to this, but all the beach boys and others working on the beach do their utmost to clean up as much as they can."
david d,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jan 2017,"Gone is the Bali or old. There's simply no excuse for the filth we behold: piles of garbage topping 6' in places, and miles of garbage stretching south and north as far as the eye can see. To make matters even worse, the return of the beanbag chair, filled with styrofoam pellets, has arrived, and all the bars north of Double 6 sport them...and they leak. So now we have millions of white styrofoam pellets added to the cigarette butts, plastic food wrappers, containers, bags and FSM knows what else. The UN should intervene. Large ashtray barrels should be deployed, fines should be posted, bulldozers brought in and darn it someone should rectify this environmental disaster. Stay away. Go to Thailand, go to Lombok, just go anywhere but here. The beautiful Balinese people are in for a rough ride if this persists."
sandcall,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2017,"My partner & I recently returned from Bali. As I'm a beach lover, while on our trip away, decided to go to the beach. I was totally shocked. There was litter everywhere, from plastic bottles, to rubbish, diapers & everything else. The water even had a oily surface as well. When we travelled to Bali 2 years ago, the beach was nothing like what we experienced that day. It was so disappointing. Not sure what the problem is. We asked a few locals & they said because of the rain, all the litter was from Java. Not sure how true this is. They also said that the beach gets cleaned but I was skeptical about that."
BGcat,"Kidderminster, UK",Jan 2017,"I have never been so shocked at the state of a beach. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's covered in litter! It's all washed up along the sand down the whole stretch of the beach, even as you walk ankle deep in the water rubbish brushes past and on your feet - disgusting! There's even a huge digger regularly driving by with entire loads of rubbish back and forth trying to clear it. It's shocking! The colour of the sand is grey, not surprisingly. And the water is literally brown, when the waves break and it should be white froth it's actually brown froth. It's vile, and shockingly unhygienic. I'd be genuinely concerned to swim it... certainly not with broken skin or cuts. It's so clearly dirty, don't risk it. Sadly the beach itself with this view and surroundings is nowhere to relax either.  The worst beach I've ever seen. How sad to see what we're all going to the planet. Maybe go see it for yourself as it's quite harrowing, but absolutely not somewhere to go for vacation or to relax/enjoy. "
navpreet k,"Mumbai, India",Dec 2016,similar on the lines of seminyak beach..you can spend your evenings here eating drinking.. it has relatively less crowd..only 2 3 restaurants on the beach
WillemJanssen,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Jan 2017,"After looking forward to the normally great beach in Seminyak, I was really disappointed to see the the beach was transformed in a plastic garbage belt. People where doing their best to clean it up, but with every tide it just washed up again. For swimming and surfing you just had to get used to have plastic wash up against your body all the time, not really great but you get used to it.If Bali doesn't manage to get rid of the plastic, I would seriously reconsider coming to Bali again in the future..."
Alan M,"Millbrae, CA",Dec 2016,"We are pretty spoiled in Australia & New Zealand for the cleaniness of our beaches. Unfortunately, the beaches we went to in Seminyak were full of rubbish & a bit smelly in places. Really takes away from the experience. However, we did enjoy a nice sunset which was lovely, and the photos couldn't pick up the rubbish!"
syamKL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Dec 2016,Rubbish everywhere...i saw an elderly man stepped onto a broken beer bottle...poor man...there are piles of rubbish...
damjan74,"Poljcane, Slovenia",Dec 2016,"Maybe it's in some other time great beach, but for New Years time it's to windy and too dirty.. but still nice place to see sun sets 👌 "
Roberto_Predonzan,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"I have been there many times. It is the typical tourist beach with sun bed, umbrellas, restaurants ... It is nice normally and very good for sunset. Many surfers and many surf schools (easy). This December the beach was full of garbage, a mess, we just walked couple of meters and went away.  At the end of the trip we went back there for a drink in a small restaurant on the beach and we were watching a wheel loader removing the garbage ... not amazing!"
Phil4218,"Gold Coast, Australia",Dec 2016,"Due to the large seas for several days, the litter was horrendous. Some attempt had been mad to pile the rubbish up but there was rubbish everywhere. That said, it's not always that bad"
scm454,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,Delicious lunch served  by attentive staff while  looking over the sparkling pool to the beach in front of Double Six. Loved the glass room where the cold meats were kept and sliced as needed.
Joanne D,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,Bit windy on me days and its a shame this time of the year rubbish comes in with the tide But nice to watch sunset and drink with some lovely stall owners 
Brian R,"Aarhus, Denmark",Jan 2017,Plastic and other debris litter the beach from the sun beds to the surf. Lots of vendors. But the surfers seemed to like the waves.
Anuj G,"Vadodara, India",Dec 2016,This beach is nice place to enjoys ur evening at a beach in Bali having nice cafe and restaurants and music 🎶 
YChan2016,Malaysia,Dec 2016,Sad to say that we were disappointed as the Beach experienced a major wash-up of rubbish when we visited.  There are definitely much nicer beaches in Uluwatu and Nusa Dua. 
Royal80E,"Turku, Finland",Dec 2016,This beach is also covered by trash. One of the most disgusting beaches where I have visited. Sea is full of floating un identified objects! Beware. Bali officials and local (and also tourists) should really take more care about the enviroment. Tourists will definately go away if the most beautiful paradise is ruined!!!!
Timothy,"Boras, Sweden",Dec 2016,"the morning fter a large rainfall this beach is covered with trash. It's pretty bad and most of the beach is not cleaned fast enough. in front of some of the pricey hotels it is clean, but the regular areas close to the bars really doesn't get cleaned. saw syringes, light bulbs, glass, metal cans, tons of plastic bags and bottles. it's a shame that such a beautiful place is not kept up better and shame on the people who can't dispose of things in a civil way."
KrisNYC006,"New York City, NY",Dec 2016,"I loved the Italian restaurant, it was amazing. The pasta's in particular were very good. Best sunset drinks on the rooftop. "
lynette291,"Pretoria, South Africa",Dec 2016,"Area covered in filth - unmentionable objects drifting in the water! Avoid at all cost, vendors are a constant irritation - do yourself a favour and go somewhere else"
cv247,"Berlin, Germany",Dec 2016,i booked some surfing lessons in one of the many places at double six beach.unfortunately during the rain season especially in december wind direction etcturn the beach in a pile of rubbish.literarily unusable.just don't waste your time going there at all in this time of the year
charstorti,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,"Great for sunset on  the beach with a cocktail or 10.... bars  line the beaches, beanbags on  the beach, live music in the background, great atmosphere"
Karin E,"Royal Oak, MI",Dec 2016,"This beach looks so beautiful from afar, but get closer, and you'll see waves of garbage sweeping up on shore, apparently from recent storms.  What a shame.  Don't swim here, or even walk on the beach, unless you want a nasty infection.  What a waste of our beach vacation."
Princess_Ronna,"Xi'an, China",Dec 2016,"We came here to eat on the beach for some local cuisine.  The evening we came, the wind was blowing so hard and the waves were out of this world!  It was CRAZY!  It was fun watching the waves as we ate."
Rina Cannon (Née Purba),"Chennai (Madras), India",Dec 2016,I was there recently and found that this beach was good for surfing. You can rent surf boards at the beach and enjoy a quite high waves. 
Sep3ani,"Bali, Indonesia",Nov 2016,Many place must go in Bali. Double six is one of them. You can enjoy sunset there while drink a bottle of beer. Many restaurant and shop around. You can also try to go to surf school there. 
Vidhu,17 contributions,Dec 2016,"You can learn to surf here,  sit down by the beach bars,  watch the gorgeous sunset.  A tad crowded though,  vibrant,  good place to people watch.  "
Chow Ming,"Hong Kong, China",Dec 2016,I gave a try to surf after a lunch at seminyak.  The wave was not world class but still surfable.  A lot of surf schools around which worth to have a lesson there for first time surfers.The only bad there was the garbbish problem. Hoping the government will do something on it.
Tachyang Lee,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,"The beach was covered to litters, and although some surfers were there. I seriously doubt it is safe to be in the water.The color of the sea water were brown and murky, ee were disappointed and did not stay there long.It needs a thorough clean up badly!"
sarahs_rafee3,Bahrain,Dec 2016,"The beach is generally okay, the tide had brought so much trash, couldn't swim because the beach is so dirty and has big waves, many surfers, lots of street sellers that try to sell random things on the beach, the beach chair rentals are around 50k each"
ChrisPrice12345,"Karuizawa-machi, Japan",Dec 2016,"Spend some time at La Plancha (their seafood is good) and its the place to be for sunset.  Good place to people watch. I don't surf, but there are a lot of schools helping beginners. As always on a non reef beach, be careful the sea is dangerous and kills.  Buy a little from the ladies and men trying so hard to support their families, even if you don't need it!"
KGB777,"Singapore, Singapore",Dec 2016,Walked along this beach whilst on a transit overnight in Seminyak. The beach is dirty and horrible. Rubbish everywhere. Just don't understand why it's so popular.
Dan L,"Bunbury, Australia",Dec 2016,"My wife came to the beach for a swim, I accompanied for a look. The prevailing winds and tides have not done any favours for Bali beaches in this area, mountains of rubbish collected and being disposed of and still more incoming. As with adjacent beaches, local authorities assisted by hotel and restaurant staff and other volunteers have achieved remarkable success and still collect incoming. Some hardy swimmers and surfers in the water. Still open for business with plenty of seats, umbrellas, touts, massages, etc. on offer. Some excellent restaurants and cafes beachside. Great effort to tackle the rubbish problem."
AndyS,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,"Pros: Good waves, fairly clean, many restaurants and cafes for meals.Cons: No place to leave your belongings (lockers)I was told Double Six had strong waves great for surfing. Only problem was i don't surf. But i can swim (or so i'm told) so the strong waves are good fun to splash around in. The beach is well maintained so it's clean. Unless you ended up at a sorry spot where it does get quite stinky so just walk around, it's quite a big beach. You'd also see hundreds of tanning beds available for rent. 2 beds and an umbrella are about 100k depending on your bargaining skills (i suck at it). And yeah, drinks are on the house with each bed. No they aren't. Prices are quite standard for beers and cocktails.If you're riding your motorbike over, do take note that they will ask for about 1K (if, i'm not wrong) to enter the area."
Anni H,"Ko Pha Ngan, Thailand",Dec 2016,"I come to beach to relax and at this beach it was nearly impossible. I rent a long chair and half a second after I had sat down the vendors started to sell all kind of stuff from sunglasses to bracelets. I counted and within 15 minutes 12 vendors had stopped by. That was very annoying. However, after the vendors had left me alone I had fun sunbathing and watching surfers catching waves.Beautiful beach but I prefer smaller and quieter ones.Tip: Buy big headphones and keep them on. They leave you alone quicker when you are ""deaf"".😎"
Ali202,"Noosa, Australia",Dec 2016,So much rubbish that it turned your stomach at the thought of walking through it and swimming in it .. did not do it and constantly getting harassed with people trying to sell you stuff when you are trying to relax !!
Lia D,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2016,"Best view and atmosphere for sun, sand and sea activities.Great venue and a must place to go when you're in Bali"
Broncos06,"Brisbane, Australia",Dec 2016,"We were told by all tour guides and locals about this must visit beach. It was incredibly dirty and littered. The drain pipe leading directly onto the beach is filled with rubbish, there are piles of rubbish at the entrance to the beach. It would be a good place to go surfing with good strong waves. Also the beach is lined with restaurants and cafes which would have been nice to eat at except it started to rain shortly after arriving"
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2016,"Spent an afternoon session here with mini grom. Waves breaking a little way off shore, rented a couple of boards from local operator. Ended up ripping a fin out from one board (cost Rp 40.000 to replace) due to beach conditions.All good."
reindeerchronicles_,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2016,"Sure the beach could be a little littered, but which beach isn't? Do visit for nice views and it's definitely a place to chill out!"
cjragu,"Coimbatore, India",Nov 2016,This lovely beach is clean and wonderful for surfing!! In the evening it becomes colorful both at the horizon and at the bank!! Excellent beach side restaurants to serve the food and drink of your choice!! Enjoy one evening!!
Aggie86jankus,Australia,Nov 2016,"The beach itself is dirty! Even tho once the rubbish is cleaned up on the beach, the water is full with plastic, paper and all sorts of rubbish!! Can't go for a swim without some trash wrapping around your arm or something floating around in your face. Entertainment wise it is a GREAT lil spot, cool lil bars, live music in evening. So not all bad, just not great for a chilled nice beachy day in the water."
annettematheson,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,Double Six has its own private beach straight across the road should you choose to relax by the beach. We used this quite a bit.
Jessica W,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,One thing I hate about Bali's main beaches is that during the day they are not tranquil. We paid to rent sunloungers and surf boards and could not get any peace when we weren't in the surf. The beach is otherwise beautiful.
bennyvectra,"Singapore, Singapore",Nov 2016,"Average beach, but too many touters irritating you. trying to sell things and promote services. will avoid in future."
annasmithwilson,"Australian Capital Territory, Australia",Oct 2016,"very nice beach,clean and we will come again next year.we take sun bath and play on the beach.people very humble here."
Chelly21,"Ubud, Indonesia",Nov 2016,A great place to have a little something to eat and drink while you watch the sunset over Seminyak. Staff are polite and quick to serve you.
Chrystal62,"Barrydale, South Africa",Nov 2016,Nice beach with lots of activities and small waves for swimming/ learning to surf but the amount of people that come up to you to sell stuff is ridiculous. Every 5 minutes I had someone come up to me and not leave until I had said no at least three times sometimes more. I am always polite and calm but some people take advantage of that and just stand there for ages after you have said no. It was so off putting especially as I was lying on my own for the most part a hubby was learning to surf. We left after an hour. I do not recommend.
Muzza59,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,We went to K Resto on Double Six Beach. The food was fantastic. So nice sitting on the beach watching the sunset and having a drink. A bit quieter than some of the other bar/restaurants but we really liked it.
sneha s,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2016,"Awesome shacks , food. And music The sunset is breathtaking U can just sit here and forget the rest of the world "
Li W,"Bendigo, Australia",Nov 2016,"Very nice beach ,cleaning up of all the rubbish was in progress,sea was calm ,hardly anyone there as early morning ."
berawA69,"Canggu, Indonesia",Nov 2016,"This is one of the most known beaches, in car difficult to reach, to much local people trying u to sell stuff expensive, the beach get cleaned up, but next to a rivermouth!"
geeky_ninja,"Adelaide, Australia",Nov 2016,"A very busy and long beach. So clean and relaxing. Lots of different flags with different meanings can be confusing for first timers.  Saw a man drowning and screaming for help, he was not being watched whilst swimming alone.  Ran to alert guards and he was rescued in time.  "
Jmg567,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Nov 2016,"So many little restaurants and bars along this beach which is massive during low tide. Take your pick, pull up a bean bag and  watch the sunset listening to live music. Pro Tip - The local surf school guys who rent the sun beds sell ice cold bintang for half the price of most of the restaurants."
Chris O,3 contributions,Nov 2016,"I love to see the sunset, its stunning. Good place to relax and just enjoy the nature. recommend place when you are in seminyak."
DeneLodding,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Walking out from the double Six hotel and onto the beach was fantastic, any time of the day, we when down to watch the sunset, we sat down and relaxed with a couple drinks and a few nibbles, comfortable relaxing and staff are great,   fantastic way to end YES another perfect day in Bali."
ronmetcalfe,"Corindi, Australia",Nov 2016,We relaxed on the beach at Andy's Bar the beer was ice cold and Andy was one of the nices guys I have ever met could not do enough for you if your on the Double six beach look for Andy's Bar on the umbrella's as so much better then the other bars you will not be disappointed cheap beer also give him a try
Amy C,27 contributions,Sep 2016,Incredibly crowded on a Sunday. The sand is a dark brown and I could see that there were oil spills before. It's okay if you want to sit and chill on a beanbag (many restaurants offering that) but I think you'd be better off at Jimbaran or some other more secluded beach. There are some smelly small streams that separate the beaches. 
DiAplo,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Nov 2016,Clean flat and giant beach. This is probably the hot spot of Bali where you can learn to surf or just chilax.
katie,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2016,"There are a lot of bars along the beach side which you could just grab a beer, pick a bean bag and watch the sun goes down. Such an amazing experience. "
inoe u,45 contributions,Oct 2016,"Long beach with a lot of beach bars. So many options for relaxing in all the bars, you can rent the relax chairs, or you can enjoying on the regular chair only with buying their beers or soda. Safe for children and pets friendly. But this beach isn't for waves breaker. Looking for beautiful sunset? This place is definitely one of the best spot."
clem c,"Royan, France",Nov 2016,The beach has several beach bars with sun loungers for hire in front of them. Surf boards for hire and the surf on the 2 days we were there seemed only average but good for beginers with a choice of surf schools. As the sun sets all the beach bars set up comfy beach bean bags with lit up tables and most provide live music. While the food is just snacks it was a great way to start the evening. There are also shops just off the beach to buy your bottles of water and sun tan cream.
Johanna R,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Not the best stretch of beach in the popular tourist areas of Kuta, Legian, Seminyak etc.  They are doing up the beach along the Legian Beach Hotel/ Mandira section which is further down (towards airport) and also the Seminyak section but seems to be leaving Double Six out.  There are heaps of restaurants/ bars etc along this stretch but its full of scooters and not very clean.  The beach itself is OK but to increase business for the traders there, they need to clean up the street that runs along this section of beach.  I love Bali anyway and the sunset can be amazing from any point along this beach!!"
Armaminta,"Cobram, Australia",Sep 2016,"We were at this beach most days.  Most of the days it was beautiful weather and the beach was clean.  The first day we arrived there it was around 2pm.  I pretty much knew the price of the umbrellas and chairs so paid that.  Two hours later the guy came to take them and said it was only a two hour price.  He wanted 50000 for two hours which is more than the daily rate.  I told him I was not impressed and he said, ok, go somewhere else.   We did.  My daughters also got their hair braided on the beach.  One daughter paid 100000 and the other paid 150000 ( her hair was very very long and very thick)  this was much cheaper than anywhere else we found and included beads.  You can choose your own colour beads.  There is a constant flow of people offering things.  We mostly didn't mind as the children wanted to buy fairy floss, laser pointers etc.  Pedicures, manicures, all very cheap and reasonable 25000.  Don't expect a first class job but the girls loved the little flowers on their fingers and toes.  We ate dinner there one night, 8 in our group and were stunned at how reasonable it was.  We all ate and drank including beer and some seafood and it cost about $80AUD The live music right there on the sand was great.  So relaxing.  The kids got to run around and play, we danced to the music.  Everyone here is happy and relaxed, it is beautiful.  "
July's M,2 contributions,Oct 2016,"very nice place and nice view, feel relaxing with the sand. it's nice for sunset too, this place is recomended :)"
Truthful Reviews,"London, UK",Oct 2016,"Came here in October while staying close by.  It is a very common beach, busy and reminded me of an over crowded beach in Spain where all the Brits go.  People playing ball games and frisby.  Not a time to relax and chill if you go here."
LisaDolphingirlbyron,"Byron Bay, Australia",Oct 2016,Not as nice as SEMINYAK - or Ullawatu or BINGIN BEACH -Just OK - GREAT TO LEARN TO SURF -- But you do get hassled a lot to buy things
tazman1099,"Houston, TX",Nov 2016,"Beach here isn't amazing.  The sand is not white powder, it's dark and has dirt mixed in.  Okay for lounging.  The city has made efforts to clean it up, so there is less trash laying around, but it's still a problem.However, the sunsets are amazing!  If the horizon isn't hazy, the colors in the sky will definitely impress you!"
emu255103,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2016,"go here in the afternoon for drinks and pub food and watch the sunset, live music at all bars between 5pm and 10pm,sit on a bean bag right on the beach while you eat and drink, gets busy at these times but worth it, great ambience and a good night out until around 10PM,heaps of bars to choose from, all on the beach. top spot "
Andrew F,"Watford, UK",Nov 2016,Double six is a wide stretch of sandy beach with lots of bed chairs and lots of hawkers trying to make a living out of the tourists selling all kinds of stuff from feet scraping to mangos!!  sea can be fairly rough and there's a surf school based there can be a bit dirty in places but not a bad place to spend a day or two 
Luke Melbourne,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,"Great to find a bar to sit for drinks and sunsets , but I wouldn't go swiming, very rough and dirty sand, although suprisingly clear of actual rubbish."
Lloyd R,"Victoria, Canada",Nov 2016,"Great Beach for surfing and boogey boarding ,Great area for bars and Bistros. spent 3 days here and loved it. No rocks or coral just some great waves and fun."
417anetth,"Szigliget, Hungary",Oct 2016,"it is usually a famous beach with thousand of people. In October, however, we found it rather calm and clean. Waves were perfect and the ocean was clean, too. There are many bars with special atmosphere and there is a very good surf school on the beach (santai surf)"
Dvdson_au,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2016,"Perfect place to enjoy the beautiful sunset spot while you enjoy the beer. Many beach lounges offers the good price for drink and food, so lovely!"
Sapna G,"Mumbai, India",Nov 2016,"We did our beginner surf lessons on this beach. Had so much fun! The waves were pretty strong, so it is not the best for leisurely swimming, but if you are into jumping waves, it is truly the best."
KMR92,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2016,Water is so beautiful. Beach is clean. Lovely to sit and relax with a BINTANG watching the sunset Hawkers can be frustrating but we just told them no. 
flamboyanku,"Bandung, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"We've just holiday at Bali for couple days, it’s  5***** luxurious hotel  I can't say enough ,check in was super and  great,The staff were welcoming and friendly ,  Breakfast at  was wonderful with selection menu delicious make complete my holiday  we highly recommend this hotel and definitely will come back"
Graham C,"Renton, WA",Nov 2016,This is a pleasant quieter beach mainly fronted by luxury resorts in Seminyak. The only drawback is the main access point on Jalan Arjuna has a stream of waste water from town emptying into the ocean. In the evenings the bars along the beach often have live music.
Julz6969,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Nov 2016,"The best sunsets ever, their AMAZING.. Bars,restaurants,music,sellers,Everbody goes to sunset in Bali..HAPPY DAYS...."
timothyb270,"Paisley, UK",Oct 2016,"Great for surfing, swimming, strolling or just relaxing with a drink. Plenty of bars and restaurants to choose from. Take time to look as there are a few gems."
india70,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2016,Double Six was overcrowded and it was difficult to get a drink. The beanbags look nice to sit on but the sand is black so your feet get really dirty. It felt really commercial and it was difficult to see the sunset due to so many people on the beach.I prefer Legian Beach as it is whiter and less formal with small family run beach bars.The traffic was terrible......I would go very early if you are travelling by car as it takes up to an hour just from Jalan Laksmana.
sinthamahardi,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"This beach located in the heart of Kuta, it is bit busy. A lot of young spend their times in here, but it is great for family too."
Mark H,Sydney,Sep 2016,"Great to walk across.. however, it is quite dirty. There is a lot of rubbish swept up across the beach.You're also expected to pay 200,000 IDR per person to ""rent"" the chairs - which really just didn't seem worth it. At first we thought it was a scam, but they were serious (we think?) - made us quite uncomfortable and so we left. "
Well_Traveld_Dorson,"Wellington, New Zealand",Oct 2016,"Huge stretches of golden sand, hot sun, and epic surf make this hard to beat as a beach spot to relax. We stayed at the Double Six resort across the road making it an awesome experience. Just be aware locals will try and sell you their trinkets? while you are there"
Roni S,"Queensland, Australia",Nov 2015,"Had a wonderful experience here: morning walks along beach, interesting people & wonderful food. Even got to hold an albino python - absolutely beautiful. Can horse ride on beach, learn to surf, close to shops, walking distance to many great venues"
Savannahmystique,"Munich, Germany",Oct 2016,This beach is better than Kuta beach Especially if you walk a bit further to the direction of kudeta the wave is big and nice to swim or surf 
SinkingSeabourn,"Brisbane Region, Australia",Oct 2016,"During the day Double Six Beach is just another Bali beach but at night time it becomes a massive entertainment centre with live bands, lots of food and alcohol, all very cheap."
Chandra G R,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2016,"Double Six Beach is at the border of Legian and Seminyak, at the end of Jalan Nakula, after it turnes into Jl Arjuna.  The beach is 'raked' clean each morning by a large green tractor, as well as by the various chaise lounge vendors.  There is surf, and several surf schools at Double 6; yet usually it is still mild enough to invite swimmers and children to play.  There are some vendore, though much less than at Kuta, and really are not bothersome..  Double Six is great for taking a morning stroll, and excellent for watching the sunset !  There is usually music, from the chair vendors, and from the hotel swimming pool across the street."
senarafirsta,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"you have to pay 5000 to park your bike and 20000 to park your carit's a robberytry the Bakso Gerobak BIru, a local meatball soup"
Robert v,47 contributions,Sep 2016,"Some of the best sunbeds I've encountered on Bali, really thick and perfect to relax on. It's always quite busy so you have to be okay with that. Sometimes there's a bit of noise polution from all of the people but it's definitely worth it. Also there's a lot of things to do on this beach."
Avidtravelmale,45 contributions,Oct 2016,Much preferred double six to Kuta beach. Much quieter for surfing and the same in terms of waves. Would visit here instead of Kuta main beach. 
Michael S,"Scottsdale, AZ",Oct 2016,This beach is just up the road from Kuta and it's worth the short trip to get there.  The waves are great and there are some very nice restaurants and beach clubs.  Sunset time is fantastic here and it's worth a visit.If you want to learn to surf then this is a great spot for beginners.
Betty M,"Hamburg, PA",Oct 2016,"Lovely clean beach, many places to go for lunch or just a drink. Lots of ladies will ask if you want a massage but if you politely decline they wont be pushy."
MrsADCae,34 contributions,Sep 2016,I love this beach. Very quiet and beautiful. I get an access from Haven Seminyak hotel. Free shuttle :)
lynton1,"Cape Town, South Africa",Sep 2016,This is a great beach with good surf and golden sand. All along the beach are some cool beach bars so what better than a stroll along the beach and then nipping into a bar for a beer. And if one wants to go upmarket then Ku De Ta is a short walk away
Sling24,6 contributions,Oct 2016,Sunset is ok but too much noisy and dirty and the drink prices are not reasonable. I will not come back
G N,"Berlin, Germany",Oct 2016,It is not a very good beach if you are not a surfer. You can find also lot of garbage. Just go there to see the sunset while you have a drink in any bar.No es una buena playa si no eres surfista. Encontrarás mucha basura. Sólo ve a mirar el atardecer en uno de sus muchos bares.
berlinIloveu,"Berlin, Germany",Oct 2016,"Terrible place which has nothing to do with bali, it's a party mile for low level drunk tourists. The beach itself is not more than ok, the bars and restaurants do occupy 80% of the room. Loud and extremely commercial."
Pedro de Pedra,"Rotterdam, The Netherlands",Oct 2016,"Clearer sand and beach with gentle inclination and waves, so good for swimming, kids, and starting surfers. At sunset very crowded with people lounging on colorful beach chairs and bean bags while DJ plays the tunes. Close to Seminyak centre."
Tony G,4 contributions,Oct 2016,"I love this hotel !The staff are all so warm and friendly, it feels like returning home.It's location is perfect across the road from the beach and close to shops, bars and restaurants.First class Spa and restaurants..the Plantation Grill combines a traditional 40,s style setting with great food and stylish jazz combos.The breakfast is the best in Seminyak and the hotel has a poolside bar and a spectacular rooftop bar.Younger generation will enjoy Cocoon next door..the in place for poolside musicThanks again to the wonderful staff for making my stay so specialTony GobboMelbourne"
Shelle123,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2015,"This Hotel really is stunning & pure indulgence, but for us a little over the top. The location is 10 out of 10, the decor & environment is lustrous & if you enjoy being waited on hand & foot & pampered this hotel will not disappoint although to us it felt almost fake. The roof top bar was sensational, one of the best that we've seen, drinks were reasonable & music was just perfect, we could easily have stayed there longer. We didn't stay for dinner as there was too much waiting around & was told later by others that it was pretty average & overpriced. I also don't think that it would be very child friendly either."
Michael B,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,"Like most of the beaches along this strip, there are hawkers, restaurants, bars and tourist galore. The hawkers don't seem to be as persistent as back in the 80's and 90's but dont engage them unless you are prepared to buy. The best answer is ""already have one thanks"". The beachside bars and restaurants spill on to rhe sand at night with great food and live entertainment."
Asif Asif,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Sep 2016,"To be honest, at first I didn't realize about this place until I looked up on the GPS map. Hard to differentiate it from the Legian beach and the Seminyak beach."
guitarist2016,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,A must do is to enjoy the sunsets by the beach sipping something cool and taking in the beach life of this lively stretch of sand. 
Jaron F,"Narrabeen, Australia",Oct 2016,"Been to Double 6 beach several times. It's good for kids to jump in the shallows of the beach. Good for cheap eats on bean bags. Good for sunsets. Bad bits are only the local people selling their wares, but they aren't pushy so not a worry. It's also challenging to get a shower to clean the kids off afterwards if you wish to clean off before going back into the streets."
Andowhite,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2016,Fantastic beach with beautiful sand but if you don't like people go early as it gets packed .. you can hire chairs umbrellas etc and drinks .... beautiful scenery
Nicholas B,pennyroyal,Oct 2016,"Been coming to Bali for years and it's really going down the gurgler. Pollution is a shocker, locals rely on ocean doing the cleaning as the majority don't seem to care (some do as I have spoken to them and they seem helpless to do anything about it)and where does all that plastic go?? Definitely don't come in the wet season, creeks that run nearby are primarily drains. A shame"
Nancy A,"Perth Hills, Australia",Oct 2016,"We came here on Friday 30/09/16, the night before the AFL Grand finals.  Last year at this time there were no seats left and were told to book the seats in the water a week before.  This time seats were plentiful and there don't seem to be anyone in the bar?So we had a few bites and a drink as they don't serve dinner here.  It was quite expensive donee decided to go somewhere else for dinner."
Michael B,"Maleny, Australia",Sep 2016,Our son in law took us here again and we thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere and the sunset. A few cold beers later and we left happily to have dinner at a nearby restaurant.Excellant way to relax and soak in the Bali lifestyle.
Sam,"Weymouth, UK",Oct 2016,"We spent most of our Seminyak days here at Rudy's bar (just along from the Seaside Mexican restaurant). Only 50,000 for 2 beds and umbrella, drinks are cheap too! The waves are big and a lot of fun in this beach. Supposably a great place to see the sunset but it keeps raining in the afternoons and is too cloudy to see the sunset so can't comment on that. Parking along the beach is 3,000 rupiah."
Martin D,"Frankfurt, Germany",Sep 2016,"Easy to get too & cheap sun lounger for the day.The local lads will watch your bag as well, for a few rupees! "
KeriBuenosAires,"Brisbane, Australia",Oct 2016,"DoubleSix seems to be the nicest stretch of the 14km beach, which runs from Kuta north (sorry, Seminyak). It is definitely a surf beach (which means it isn't great for actually swimming). But it does seem to be a great place to learn to surf - warm water, sand, not coral, and a constant wave. As well, as dozens of surf teachers and schools. It is also a great walking beach."
Mary l,whitsundays Aus.,Jun 2016,"Great bars, plenty of restaurants,  excellent views, beanbags on beach at bars.  Check out Double Six Rooftop bar, it is amazing. "
Dayana_Kantarevic,88 contributions,Sep 2016,Great beach with plenty of restaurants and bars.You can book a sun bed and it is pretty cheap for the entire day.Good atmosphere.
Melz Y,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2016,"Lovely beach to have relax time and lay down for a day.. sunbath, reading a book, having beer. its really good to back and have great time like beach boys hahahha...  "
Picadores,"Frankfurt (Oder), Germany",Sep 2016,"It's like almost all beaches in south west Bali. The trash is swept by the ocean, the tourists and the locals. Therefore there's glass on the beach and plastic swimming in the ocean. Disgusting!"
Harrietzhong,"Penang Island, Malaysia",Dec 2015,This seminyak beach is very nice and not so crowded compared to kuta beach which is located very close.
Marc P,"Cologne, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany",Sep 2016,"Well, 66 beach has become very popular. When you come down from Jalan Double Six to the right: There are many small beach restaurants where you can sit on the beach and enjoy live music.To the left: there you can rent sunchairs for 25.000 idr ( ca. 1,70€). The boys will look after your stuff when you go swimming or surfing. It has become a very popular beach so especially on weekends and evenings it becomes very crowded. The sunsets are really breathtaking.Try to enjoy a bowl of Bakso while you are there. The stand is on the beach a bit to the South of Café Zanzibar. Best Bakso in Bali."
Helen2515,"Wollongong, Australia",Sep 2016,"Hired sun chairs here to relax and read.Initially got hounded by locals trying to sell their produce, and massages. Didn't take long for them to realise we didn't require anything, the icecream vendor was fantastic though. Just what we needed when we were really hot.We didn't swim in the beach, however my husband went surfing here."
yialli,"Greater London, UK",Sep 2016,"There's a few good bars on the beach here, reasonable prices (well for Seminyak, not for Bali, the whole of Seminyak and surrounding area is ridiculously expensive so these bars are the cheap end of ridiculously expensive). More at commonsensible.org"
ElizabethCHelsinki,"Nueva Andalucia, Spain",Sep 2016,Fantastic location for the sunset watch. Many lovely cafes and restaurants just by the beach so you can sit there while enjoying the sunset.These cafes get pretty crowded so be sure to be there before 6pm in order to get a place. Prices of drinks are slightly higher than cafes on the streets but worth it for the sunset view.
Kurt W,43 contributions,Aug 2016,A lot to choose from in beach food and drinks. The meatballs are great for a bit and la plancha on the bean bags for sunset is cool
beat788,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,"nice partytime especially for the smaller ones up to 18 Otherwise lots of fun and games all around busy shoppint, etc. ."
Anand1351,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2016,"We stayed in the haven hotel and walked to Double six beach which is nearby. Beach is great, darkish Sand, you can walk for miles and enjoy beautiful views. We went twice, in afternoon and another day to watch Sunset. You does not feel crowded, you can walk north upwards Seminyak or southwards towards Kuta.There is a Surfing school there and people were enjoying taking lessons and trying as waves are high.Not suitable for Swimming as currents are strong there. Sand there is so soft that you can walk for miles comfortably."
Simon P,"Bristol, UK",Sep 2016,"Lovely sandy beach. The waves are perfect for surfing, but there are strong currents so not ideal for swimming. The beach was a bit crowded with games of football at times, but the beer was cheap!"
AlexGUK94,"Hartford, UK",Sep 2016,This is a nice beach. It is lined with many little bars and surf shops that create a nice atmosphere to relax on and the water is great for learning to surf. I would recommend Santai surf as they were fantastic.   
Shamroze Z,9 contributions,Sep 2016,"This beach is filled with surfers and there are lots of instructors around as well. So if you ever wanted to try this sport, double six is the place to go! "
June H,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,"My name is George Hondris and my wife June recently went to this Luxurious Hotel to once again enjoy their hospitality and food.As we suspected we were not disappointed service & food was excellent. Unfortunately I picked up a stomach bug FROM MY PREVIOUS DESTINATION  which precluded me from eating. Once the Managing Director ascertained about my ailment, he personally arranged for a pot of Ginger Tea to be delivered to my room.  I tried the drink with treportatiion and was surprised to find that it was very pleasant. What a lovely guesture from a very very busy man.He made several attempts to communicate with me during the time of our stay unfortunately i was out of action. "
Mike P,"Innsbruck, Austria",Sep 2016,"Great swimming and surfing beach, dangerous currents (swim between the flags. Lots Pollution and small beach bars."
TanFerry,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"This beach is a must go if you are coming to bali! Lots of activities going on here with some nice food stalls for you to enjoy. Best time to come is sunset, friends with me really enjoyed the local food stalls and beers while watching the beautiful sunset!"
ManagerNest,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,"Nice beach up from Kuta , not so busy  Could get chairs and beer easily, Good coffee just behind us in The Book Cafe. Relaxing not hassled!!"
zpclan,"Quebec City, Canada",Sep 2016,"Nice clean beach, lot of people and warung, big waves, nice spot to learn surf. Nice sand. Easy access and free"
Pumperman,"Adelaide, Australia",Sep 2016,"I thought this would not be my cup of tea, but I came to love taking a walk down to the busy beach, grabbing a bean bag seat and sinking a few $2 bintang's whilst listening to tunes.There a plenty of guys with chilly bins to chose from, with the prices the same across the board.The only irritation is the constant hawkers selling their fake goods at ramped up prices."
Neil F,"Invercargill, New Zealand",Sep 2016,Expansive beach with a nice surf swell. Water temperature is better than our air temp back home in the summer time!
redhat eileen b,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2016,Good long stretch of beach for a walk. Several temporary beach bars with young men wanting to sell you a beer. Local dogs play in the surf and surfers make the most of the waves. Not my ideal location but pleasant
Bernard Š,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2016,Nice place to watch a sunset. You'd have to go early to get the best seats otherwise you'll be shoulder surfing for sunset views. For me getting cocktails that tasted like mocktails were a turn off especially when paying aussie prices. I couldn't be bothered arguing that night so didn't bother telling them and we just left after our drinks.
GrikAsianNomad,"Da Nang, Vietnam",Feb 2016,"lots of bean bag style chairs grouped together into informal beach bars with soft drinks and beer.  food is not always for sure, depends on who shows up cooking which dishes around your spot.  but for sure it's the most relaxing and pleasant beaches in the area."
kimberly B,"Toronto, Canada",Aug 2016,The beach is wide and lined with hotels with water view restaurants. Lots of people come to watch the sunsets. Have dinner at one of the beach restaurants like La Lucciola or Breezes.
Mats H,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2016,"I absolutely love this beach and it's busy from sunrise until midnight. Take a walk in the morning, do some surfing later in the day and end with drinks and dinner with live music. Think my wife took 500 photos of the sunset. "
Thales B,3 contributions,Sep 2016,Party beach with lots of restaurants and bars. Good to chill out with friends having a white wine and beers at the sunset!
Jen S,"Daegu, South Korea",Sep 2016,"Free clean beach, and in my opinion the beast beach, in southern Bali.  A great place to walk along the beach, rent a lounge chair for the day (70,000 to 100,000 rupiah) and read a book, or put your toes in the ocean. Also no free toilets, you have to pay 5000 rupiah to use one. Not the best beach for swimming but very good waves if you are a surfer. The restaurants along here are overpriced and not that great food wise, but if you travel inward a bit from the beach there are tons of local joints you can get amazing food at a steal."
Sue H,"Sydney Olympic Park, Australia",Aug 2016,"Great beach and atmosphere. Lots of people, restaurants,shopping and swimming. Always something happening or just sit back and watch the passers by. Great swimming beach"
William O,"Algarvia, Portugal",Sep 2016,This beach just shows how we can ruin a great place! Don't look here for the reputed silver sands of Bali!
suzanne1207,"Bendigo, Australia",Sep 2016,We stayed at the double six with another couple. The staff are beyond compare the facilities also. We had an issue with noise as we are early risers and early to bed. The venues directly across the road were a problem ... I have been assured by management they are in the process of replacing windows with double glazed Windows which will elevate those concernsThe food in the Italian restaraunt was superb and again so were the staffNothing is a problem the rooms were beautiful and the bathrooms were probably the best I've come across on AsiaIf we go back to Bali without hesitation we will definitely stay at double six again
Blossom S,"Arzignano, Italy",Sep 2016,"Many thing you can do in this beach, from walking in the morning, surfing in the afternoon until you can see the beautiful sunset in the evening. After sunset you still can enjoy the live band and enjoy the dinner. So awesome!!!"
Lucky7Traveler,"Santa Barbara, CA",Sep 2016,"The beaches and ocean in Bali are really made for strong swimmers. There tends to be some heavy rip tides and strong currents. I would advise anyone wanting to go in the water to be careful if they are weak swimmers. Yes, there are lifeguards, but don't put yourself in a risky position. With that said, this is a wonderfully fun beach and I must have been out in the water for 4 hours one day just jumping in and out of waves! So much fun!"
CKBliss,"Rockingham, Australia",Sep 2016,"Great beach for a swim, or just a walk, or even just to sit around and have a meal and/or drinks. So much goes on down here and if you're looking for a place to eat, there's many places to choose from. "
Floriano B,"Bari, Italy",Sep 2016,we had an amazing time especially after 6 pm coz the sun is going down and cover bands start to play a nice music you can enjoy by having a drink.
Maree68,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"I don't have any other beach to compare this too, but coming from the Gold Coast, I do know a good beach when I'm on one, and this was a very nice beach.  One day the waves were big, and the next day not as large, but still enjoyed by families galore.  You do have people selling their wares on this beach, but I imagine you are going to have that on every beach, and they were all very respective with big smiles.  There are restaurants all the way along the beach for you to choose from when you need a break from swimming or sunbaking :D"
Yuliana Y,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Clean water, Nice view, and nice Meat ball soup stall called ""Bakso Gerobak Biru"" which open at 2pm in certain days only. "
StefanBlezynski,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,I just wanted to go for a quick swim and see what this beach was like. The minute you step on the beach you are swarmed by locals asking you to pay 100k to rent a seat and umbrella for 1 hour! So we decided to sit on the sand but were given dirty looks by the locals. The beach had quite a bit of rubbish. The  water was warm and nice however.
Gillian W,Perth,Jul 2016,We met friends here for a pre dinner drink and to watch the sunset - perfect venue for this and the service was terrific too!
Martin W,"Gravesend, UK",Sep 2016,"Plenty of beds. Surfing available, lots of beach bars and restaurants nearby. Cashpoint machines at at bottom of Jl Arjuna. Nice breakfast at the Trattoria "
ChrisRooboy1964,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,We would walk beach everyday from Seminyak to Legion and found Double six beach a great stop for a cold drink. You can also enjoy the sunset on a bean bag with a cocktail or cold beer. Hawkers don't harass but still come past and ask the question. Also good massage available when required but check for cleanliness.
JandH201403,United Kingdom,Jul 2016,"We stayed athe the DOUBLESIX HOTEL for part of our honeymoon, and this beach was stunning. We spent time there every sunset. "
McManwein,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2016,"Was very surprised to find that the beach and environment has been cleaned up recently, it used to be really dirty and hawkers would constantly hassle you but on this visit I found that people were left alone to enjoy it and couldn't believe the transformation, it was beautiful.  We even saw a marching band one night.  "
taga09,4 contributions,Jul 2016,great bintangs on the beach and friendly singalongs. Nothing is ever to hard always willing to help with a sun lounge and umbrella.
Tetty S,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Very recomended for sunset time in Bali,Very comfort beach with nice place and best beach ever, feeling more calm to enjoy your drinks and food while sunset.A live music with a good entertaining complete your day.A must have to visited place in Bali for all..Awesome place that ever me with lil sis and friends visited.our last visited 21st August 2016 and will miss the moment"
calmci,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"The hot weather makes the beach a must, but it can be busy, and dirty at times. Still worth a visit for sure."
Ultimatejetsetter,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,This hotel has absolutely beautiful rooms & a gorgeous roof top bar which is amazing!There are sun bed  issues though & can be quite frustrating on a daily basis.Staff are polite & friendly.Location is good.
Edward,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2016,This Beach is connected with seminyak beach. there are a lot of seaside restaurant in this beach. the sand is soft so it was perfect for sport activity. but be careful for swimming as the wave is quite strong and i didnt see any lifeguard around.
Manjusha P,22 contributions,Aug 2016,This beach is after the double 6 market. Lots of people. A nice restaurant/cafe which provide bean bags to sit on the beach if you buy drinks. Lots of vendors too. They also had English Pop music playing from loud speakers. Great atmosphere.
1000Mike,"Seattle, WA",Aug 2016,"Go to the beach end of Jalan (street) Arjuna.  Turn left, and you are in the daytime area.  Many nice restaurants on the left, and the beach on the right.  On the beach is one vendor after another selling beer and soft drinks.  Free chairs if you order.  Loungers usually cost extra.  The beach pretty much closes down after sunset, although the restaurants stay open.  Go to the right, and you are in the night area.  The crowds arrive at sunset. Each beach side restaurant has lights and live bands on the beach.  Sit in your bean bag chair, listen the the live band,  and order food, beer or cocktails.  "
Janene D,"Mornington, Australia",Aug 2016,"Had a great night at the bean bag restaurants, heaps of restaurants, music and sellers of merchandise e.g. sarongs, bracelets, toys, paintings etc etc.  very cheap prices"
clivehaddow,"Gold Coast, Australia",May 2016,Double Six is a fun beach - no frills but nice.Bintang costs around $2.50 per beer small and plenty of options.Loungers are plentiful and cost around $10 for lounger and umbrella.Spent many hours on this beach. Hire surf boards for $10 per hour.CLIVE
Jodi lee T,12 contributions,Aug 2016,"So glad we booked Double Six - Excellence in every way.Luxury rooms with 10/10 service day and night with your own butler service too! Loved the week we spent here very memorable for our Anniversary time and defiantly will recommend for anyone to come stay here. So relaxing,  such delicious food and the most helpful and friendly staff I have ever met- well done Double Six."
PeteW,"Cannon Creek, Australia",Aug 2016,"The beach was close to our villa so we walked here most mornings, there is a drain flowing out near the end of Double Six street which we weren't to keen on walking through so this limited the walk a little but once you are out near the breaking waves it isn't an issue. There is plenty of restaurants for breakfast on the beach too."
KayeGie,38 contributions,Jun 2016,"In a place like Bali where it is so busy, it is hard to locate something like this on the beach. However, they have The Pullman Hotel directly behind them as an easy landmark! This surfing school & it's community of people are so caring & genuine. Enjoying every moment of my family developing their skills, also bringing them food on the beach. I had a lovely foot massage by a sensitive sensible lady who knew exactly how to do it, not rough & ready like some."
barryjap,"South Tangerang, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"While we're sitting in one of the numerous beach cafes, my ears had to suffer through the cacophony of noises coming out from the speakers of every other cafes in the surrounding areas. Definitely not my kind of scene."
rayholiday2016,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,The Double Six Hotel is one of the most outstanding hotels along Double Six Beach. Check out the stunning roof top bar
pashton2016,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2016,The venue is amazing. The view spectacular. The service wonderful but the snacks were extremely disappointing.To sit in the sunken seats on the roof top bar was spectacular. You have to spend A$100 which is not too hard however when you go to a 6 star venue you expect quality. The daiquiris came out of a slushy machine and the tapas type food was flavorless and of a poor quality (which we left). The wine was very well priced as were the beers.In saying that it is definitely worth drinking there even if only for the view
hanakaa2016,"Gold Coast, Australia",Aug 2016,Always a great place to eat with a wide range to choose from.  This restaurant is located next to Niksoma Hotel right on the beach
Jose G,"Valencian Country, Spain",Aug 2016,"Really not much here, sits at the mouth of a water runoff river, smelly. At least it was quiet. Sometimes quiet is good in Bali."
chris-bailey-sydney,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2016,"What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple. On this occasion, there are a few kids or all ages, but mostly coupes and small groups of men and women is their early 30's. It's quiet, classy and relaxed with EVERYTHING you could ever want at your fingertips.  10/10 for Double Six.  Chris and Kev "
Joe B,"Waterford, Ireland",Aug 2016,This was a great place to stop by for an evening drink but I did think it was a bit expensive but I would still return as the location and ambience of the place was great
talavalino,Philippines,Aug 2016,"Great for beginner surfers, amazing sunset but crowded. Not for people looking for a peaceful quiet place. Amazing sunset. Stayed at La plancha bar"
Aussie073,"Kensington, Australia",Jun 2016,"Great atmosphere, dinner and drink service with toes in the sand and live music every night. Bothered a bit by sellers with their goods, but that Bali and adds to the charm."
Sean d,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2016,"When you just want to relax, your still approached for either games on the beach or hires (surfboards etc)"
GrantRobyn,"Sunshine Coast, Australia",Jul 2016,"My husband & I recently stayed at this hotel. It was pure luxury! The room was fantastic, view beautiful & extremely clean. The best thing about this hotel was the staff. They were exceptional! Can't recommend this hotel enough. "
beegee165,"Tallahassee, FL",Aug 2016,Didnt' really care for this beach. Water had a lot of trash floating in it. Bad Rip current. Be careful with little ones. I held on to my daughter's life vest as the waves came in and almost dragged us back out. Cant really swim there. Get some loungers and an umbrella and enjoy some Bintangs!
Worldtravelernikceno,New York,Aug 2016,At least here you can still have a subbed for 20.000 rupiah. The waves are nice and the restaurants as well. My favorite
AmyM440NZ,"Wellington, New Zealand",Aug 2016,A must do. Beer and food is reasonably priced. Watch out for the people trying to sell you stuff on the beach when you're sitting in your bean bag... found it easiest to so no thank you politely then not say anymore. And don't forget your insect repellant. A wonderful evening and a trip highlight ✨✨✨
wonderingtraveller80,"Birmingham, UK",Jan 2016,"this is nice beach, busy and relaxing, great to be here during sunset, because you get a great views and you can relax at the number bars, while sitting on the bean bags. There is always live music during the evening"
Kungandhi,Delhi,Jun 2016,Good beach to get relax and activities are also there. very nice weather and enjoying beach with family. 
boydie109,Newplmouth Newzealand,Aug 2016,"Stunning view early evening drinks and nibbles great service ,great if you have a group with sunken seating surrounded in water looking out over the beach."
ange827,27 contributions,Aug 2016,We always stay along this area. The shops have so much variety & the quality is great.The beach area we love especially the bean bag bars with their live music each night. There are some great restaurants hidden up the street a little from the beach that are far better prices & the food is more authentic Balinese. 
rebeccajones68,South America,Jan 2016,we are been Double six beach is nice place for relaxing because good view of the sea at winner season .  
piku1980,"Singapore, Singapore",Oct 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable."
dennisp859,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2016,A walk along the beach is one of the pleasures of a Bali visit.Double Six Beach is fronted by Luxury Hotels right to the beach.Dozens of AirAsia umbrellas line the beach along with  beach chairs all of which have a price on them if you wish to spend time.The hawkers are there but not too bad.Always a highlight during a visit.
Casandra M,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2016,"Where at the beach, the wave almost impossible to swim  and its happen with nature, no human can control it. Do not complaint"
DCKB,"Murten, Switzerland",Aug 2016,My kids had a blast practicing surfing in double six - and when you are hungry you can just get around and grab a pizza or pasta.
Mae G,3 contributions,Jul 2016,The sand was beautiful but very unhappy about being hassled about paying for seats and umbrellas. Also being overcharged for beer.
Verina Smith,"London, UK",Aug 2016,Have a lot of small cafe by the beach. So you can sit and drinks while waiting the sunset. They provide sun chairs aswell. There is one place with famous Bakso. One portion only 15k. The quie is quite long but the server areound can assist to get it for you. Nice taste aswell.
DWgoldengrove,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2016," I like this area some good restaurants along beach at night , love cocoon for a drink. Easy access as cars not allowed through at night. Nice walk after dinner."
DDej,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Not to be missed a definate stand out in Seminyak, sipping  cocktails in a pod spectacular ocean views "
iamparthj,"Mumbai, India",Feb 2016,"We loved this beach, they have small shacks with live music and beautiful sunset, loved being here, should definately visit for a drink, sunset and music combo."
Bernd E,"Graz, Austria",Aug 2016,We like this beach because it's not so crowded and much cleaner than the others.The beach is also more flat and therefore better for young children. Even at high waves it's safe to swim as they break further offshore.Beach offers restrooms for a small charge (IDR 3000).
markhuse87,"Milton Keynes, UK",Aug 2016,"Cheap drinks, great place to go in the evening and sit and drink whilst watching the sun set. Drink in the bars on the beach not off the road. Much cheaper and better views! "
James B,2 contributions,Jun 2016,I have been to this place many times and never get bored with the venue.This is the best spot for relax and watch the sunset.
Csna70,26 contributions,Jul 2016,Lovely beach and sand. Always packed with people. You can play around the beach at day time and sun bathing then moved to bean bags at 5PM.
Adr1an100,"Fremantle, Australia",Aug 2016,We went to the roof top bar. Absoloutly best view in Bali.Spoilt by expensive watery lolly water drinks. Will never go there again. Great spot for people with too much money and no taste!!
Bernard Budi S,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2016,"Last week i was here, i run with my friends through this beach... not very clean i think.. the waves was good at that time.. thats why a lot of people were surfing. The best time to go to this beach is at the evening ylu can see a beautiful sunset here.. lots of rooftop bar at here so you can easily pick one"
Anita W,8 contributions,Aug 2016,"Lovely sandy beach, easy to rent loungers. I love watching the surfers, and my teenage daughter was impressed enough by all happening around. "
Vikrant0308,"Amritsar, India",Jul 2016,"This is near W hotel, which I found it to be very calm as compared to other beaches in bali, it was fun here to sepnd time drinking beer and having Corns. "
Ian S,"Berri, Australia",Jun 2016,Nice for a walk along and past all the restaurants next to the beach - the ones on the beach and the ones on the other side of the road are a little on the expensive side - but the view is good.
Mark S,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"If your into the surf, sea & sand this is a good spot. If you just want to relax on one the beach chairs under the umbrella and watch all around you this is also a good spot.You do get locals wanting to sell you the usual but they are not over the top nor persistent and you can get some good bargains!"
Michelle L,Auckland,Jul 2016,"Our hotel had a private spot at Double Six Beach, we pay the guys 150k for 2 lounge chairs for 5 hours (outside of hotel's territory). it was nice as it's right in front of the beach, with not many people around."
deejay1948,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,"Busy beach but plenty of sun lounges to hire....negotiate...they ask for 100,000 but walk away if they won,t take 50,000.Remember,you are renting it,not buying it.Try to swim in the flagged area but don,t expect Bondi Rescue life guards.Be aware..there is often a strong undertow.Bali beaches can be very dangereous."
Gary D,"Austin, TX",Jul 2016,"During my 3 week stay in Bali, the Double Six Beach was my favorite hang-out!  Besides being beautiful (and filled with beautiful people!), the cafe's shops and staff were outstanding!  A true, Bali gem of a beach!"
Sarah H,15 contributions,Jul 2016,"Lots of bars with live music and comfy beanbags on the sand, great to chill out after dinner and have a drink"
hwangpauline,"Ottawa, Canada",Jul 2016,We passed by at night so couldn't really appreciate the beach and its beauty (if any). I'd give this a pass for other beaches though.
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Jul 2016,"Double 6 is one of the nicest beaches on Bali. It is very big and stretches from Kuta upto Seminyak. Double 6 is perfctly located in the middle and has some great waves for surfing and some nice beachbars and restaurants.Mind you prices are relatively high, specially in the busy seasons"
girleen,"Portland, OR",Jun 2016,"Our go to beach in Seminyak. We've been learning to surf here. The waves are fast so it's hard work, but it's fun to try. Great casual bars and beach restaurants. Nice place to chill."
Geoff M,"Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand",May 2016,"This review relates to day time visits, not night time:Once you get past the filthy street and open drains, I found a surprisingly pleasant experience. The beach was clean, street vendors - yes, but not too many and not too pushy, nice drinking and eating. An all round good relaxing experience, which saw me return a few times. Enjoyed sitting in the bars, by myself, having a beer and pondering life.I did not however, go swimming here, so cannot comment on the quality of the water."
martianoairlangga,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Wonderful beach. A great place for sunbathing, umbrella, dogs, swim, and usually some local plays beach football with other tourists also.. what a nice view"
MariaWells,"Nowra, Australia",Apr 2016,"The beach quite busy (was not like Kuta beach), lots of cafe, beautiful sunset, we love to walk from double six to Legian beach.."
helenmcd,Australia,Jul 2016,"Rubbish everywhere, the beachside bar where we stopped for a drink was filthy and overpriced. Smoking was allowed inside/undercover as well. The tatty beach chairs were unappealing, unless you were settling down to a day drinking beer I guess."
Tonymaddogsurfer,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,less people annoying you to buy stuff than kuta! good for sunset too. la plancha is good for dinner and a drink 
Chris B,"Miranda, Australia",Jul 2016,"Very popular beach. You can enjoy your drink under the beach umbrellas, listen to western style music, surf, swim or simply walk around."
eakalev,"Tallinn, Estonia",Jul 2016,If you like waves and surfing and sun taking this is place for you.In the beach many restaurants and in the evening was beach very nice.
Alex G,3 contributions,Jun 2016,"This place is 100% FANTASTIC the staff were amazing, Juni from the Breezes hotel resort (sister resort) got us a few nights here. We loved it! The breakfast buffet was ALL TIME!"
Jean & John C,"Monasteraden, Ireland",Jul 2016,Nice beach with lots of facilities and good cafes and restaurants close by.   Spend the whole day here and you wont regret it.  Perfect for everyone.
Em-n-Bee,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jul 2016,"Went for a walk along the beach in the morning, smelt bad from a storm / waste water run-out and there was rubbish everywhere!"
Lydia H,4 contributions,Jul 2016,"idk why people said that this beach is the best beach... for me, this beach so dirty and i prefer kuta beach than this beach. My suggestion : you should try Padang Padang Beach at Uluwatu. "
Guy W,"Greensborough, Australia",Jul 2016,heaps of food choices and places to drink.  From warungs to large hotel bars.  A choice of foods and loads of cold beers.  The ladies give good foot massages and are always up for a good chat and laugh.
NoakhaillaBHOOT,"Dhaka City, Bangladesh",Jul 2016,"Its THE best beach in Bali to spend the day with your family and friends. Its not crazy crowed like Kuta or Legian Beach. Also for me, the crowd here seemed a bit better in terms of ""class"" (sorry for being politically incorrect) ... but its true!!! Kuta and Legian beaches are like fish markets compared to this one. The Double6 beach is much much cleaner and the restaurants on the beach are quite nice, nothing great but just nice. You can rent seats/umbrella for USD 20 for the whole day, surf boards are USD 7.5, body boards are USD 4 !!! There are beer guys right at the beach, they serve really chilled beers and drinks (with nuts) right to you on the sand. Its awesome. But the best part was the water, it was warm to perfection. We simply loved our time at the Double6 beach. I highly recommend this one. Why I don't like the other beaches: 1. Nusa Dua : Nice and clean, but they are mostly Shell Beaches, not comfortable for going for a swim. The waves are quite calm as well. 2. Kuta & Legian : Too crowed and a bit dirty."
Darren O,22 contributions,Jul 2016,Surf lessons available nice beach sand slight grey colour but beautiful swell does vary.    Calm yesterday 6 foot today but that's the biggest in our seven days.  Kids no problem.    3-yrs with hand held of adult near buy would be safe
AileenSy_1984,108 contributions,Feb 2016,"Double6 is a seasoned spot for sundown drinks and it is amazing for that. The scene is set and adjusted to lure unsuspecting tourists to sit by these colourful beanbags like fly to a trap. The bands that play live music is a good touch, they start somewhere around 7-10 pm on weekends. Not sure on weekdays. Throughout the afternoon however, you will be asked 20 times by random people selling a range of random items, from bouncy glowing balls, to massage, to hair braiding, surf lessons, pirate boat shaped kites, machetes, the list goes on. Next time, i will video and put together a clip, lol!Anywho, the waters during the months of Sept -Nov are sort of dirty, with floating bags and beer cans. It doesn't sweep in the shore and stays by the break. It is quite visible on a non wavey day. There are plenty of little shops where you can but beer (IDR20k) for or snacks that they can bring to your rented sun lounges for IDR 50k (if you can haggle like a Chinese would :D Thanks mom!) to IDR 150k. Overall an ok experience, but not something I want to do again, or reminisce on. "
EllaGD,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2016,"Nice to walk along around  5 in the afternoon a few bean bag bars which are lovely, take a sarong to sit on as the bean bags are a bit grubby!"
kathNelsonNewZealand,nelson new zealand,Jul 2016,Comfy bean bags to sit on .Live music every night. Drinks all  varieties. Food a bit on the fry side but great if you have had too many Bintangs..
Teguh P,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"A beautiful sunset and nice beach bar. the sand, the wave, and the drink are very pleasant.an ice cold beer and a comfortable bean bag are great couples to spending time in here"
YHN-ID,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Jul 2016,"sand is smooth , there are people who can rent us Horse to go around the beach , a lot cafe to get drink , there are also life guard standby so feel safe to swim.  and you can see beautiful sunset if you lucky :)"
Sultan A,6 contributions,Jul 2016,The beach smells bad like sewerage I don't like  the dirt and smell but the view is something else. I loved the view but without smell
Steven J,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2016,What an awesome way to finish off a great day in Bali. Ice cold Bintangs and cocktails on comfortable bean bags with local cover bands playing and lanterns being launched. Beautiful atmosphere.
Phathj75,97 contributions,Jul 2016,"Double six beach is always a destination for my Wife and I, We love to arrive around 545pm, Just before the crowds roll in, Find a prime seat in one of the many beach bars, Order a cold beer and a snack and watch the Sunset roll across the countryside, For about an hr you forget the world exists.You will get approached by the beach sellers, but they are polite and prompt to dispatch.there is no sunset if it has been raining, but the experience is great none the less."
Annaliese L,"Newlands, South Africa",Jul 2016,"We loved this beach, it was great for a day time tan and swim as long as you do not mind the traders that hassle you every 5 minutes. Also a wonderful place to watch the sunset and have a cocktail...............or even dance on the beach with live music."
Flyholiday50,"Fethiye, Turkey",Jul 2016,Busy beach. Lots of surfers. Sunbeds moved down the beach as tide goes out. Bit confusing when we came back from lunch. Paid 50k idr each for a bed 
mikasinaga,"Bali, Indonesia",Aug 2015,"I came to this place over and over again!Nice view, good environment, there are a lot of restaurants and warung, etc.White sand, you can see the surfer ..But more than all, this place is the best to see the sunsets!"
Alexandre S,"Bangkok, Thailand",Jul 2016,Nice beach with enough waves for surfers. Quite packed with tourist on the beach but no much crowd in water.  Amazing scenery from as there nothing expect of the sea at the horizon
PaulineTAntrum,"Paraparaumu, New Zealand",Jul 2016,"A truly beautiful beach. Clean, nice sand and great waves. Stunning at sunset where loads of happy people gather and enjoy a drink, food, traders, everything's peaceful. Kids playing laughing running, a real happy place to be. Great selection of food places to eat."
Ben W,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2016,"Stinks, pretty dirty beach. Struggled to justify the $10 for the lounges on the beach, but it was worth it to get the food and drink service. There is an open sewer very near where we were going straight in the ocean. Like most beaches in Bali, they just can't compare with what we have in Australia. "
fiona d,"Sidney, Canada",Jul 2016,"the view is great and easy for commuters, try their restaurant especially Sate Bali restaurant in Kayu aya village, the food was amazing and they have JOGLO view and wooden concept which is great and pretty"
svetick777,"Los Angeles, CA",Jun 2016,"Beautiful Beach with nice beach restaurants with comfortablesoft chairs, nice views, relaxing....I loved being there."
Swindon_Boy,Swindon_Boy,Jun 2016,"Great beach for sundowner drinks. Find one of the numerous bars on the beach, pull up a chair, bean bag or sun lounger and watch the sunset while having a few Bintangs. Plenty of resyaurants nearby for a meal once the sun has set."
Ulrich S,"Thun, Bern, Switzerland",Jun 2016,There are a lot of chairs. At the beach you can get food and drinks. Quite a lot of people always there.
Ivette C,"Chicago, IL",May 2016,"I stayed at the Courtyard by Marriott and the hotel has a little spot right in front of the Double Six Beach hotel for its guests. Unfortunately, the beach was very dirty. Not the ideal paradise when you think of Bali, but it was a decent beach to run in the morning and to look at the surfers, bargain with different vendors and relax. "
sarah H,Indonesia,Jul 2016,Love this beach starting from legian walking the beach to seminyak is simply stunning. A lot of dog walkers early in the morning & a fair bit of rubbish past the private villas but it was being cleaned but still not nice to see. Over all still a beautiful beach
F4745GValexc,8 contributions,Jul 2016,Do not come here with children unless you are here to party it's noise after noise. The music on the beach goes on until midnight every night. Very loud techno and karaoke not a nice tranquil holiday we imagined Bali to be. Very disappointed with this tacky style holiday
Susan P,"Greater Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,"Beautiful rooms, comfy bed, great pool, unbelievable rooftop bar, would return to this hotel anytime."
ThompsonBuggins,"Bushmills, UK",Jul 2015,We got to try out a few different beaches. We preferred Seminyak Beach as it was calmer and less people for us as a family. Double Six Beach is probably best for surfers and those who want to socialise with others. It's got lots of bars on the beach so noisier than Seminyak Beach. 
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,"Relatively  clean beach by Bali standards. Lots of food outlets, with various types of  bean bags on the beach. An interesting place to have an evening meal and watch the sunset. You will need to find a sweet spot between the many music groups and Djs all playing very close to each other. This beach does have hawkers selling various items, but not as pushy as in Kuta. If you are in one of the beach side food outlets they tend to leave you alone. Beware as the tide comes in it will reach some of the bean bag restaurants."
Gary_Bagus,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"Good surf and beach facilities, plenty restaurants and bars Cocoon Day bar on beach and a rocking place."
jcarnell2016,"Bali, Indonesia",May 2016,"This beach is very touristy and the busy areas in front of the hotels is a hawker's paradise, hassling you constantly for what ever you want or need, but further up the beach it is nicer, and less polluted, not sure if I would swim there! Bali has very different laws regulating sewerage treatment (or lack of treatment), just an observation IMO, there are many much more beautiful places to swim in Bali, pick one."
alliglenn,Melbourne,Jun 2016,"I spent a gorgeous (hot) day walking the beach from Seminyak to Legian while my travel buddies shopped - one day of shopping is all I need in Bali :) During this walk I stopped at locations on the way to have a drink and a swim which was ok at each place except Double 6. I was going to have lunch there as well but was told the pool was only for guests (this may be the norm in many countries but in Bali it was quite unusual). There were many people around the pool but no-one in it! I decided to take my money next door to Cacoon and had a lovely swim, some tapas and a delicious cocktail. Probably wouldn't go back there with so many other options in Bali."
CenturyAlpha,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Colorful, that was the impression when first time visit there. Everybody cheers up waiting for sunset. At that time, the beach was good for learn to surfing. Not only adults, kids were here and there running in the water and some played with sands. Very nice place to enjoy. More crowded people came, when the clock closed to 6pm. No ticket fee to access, only parking if we carry vehicles. And several music stage were ready to complete your time."
PY L,9 contributions,Jun 2016,Went there one morning to take a stroll along the beach and enjoy the waves but was approached by the surf schools and other sales people almost every minute. Plug into your ear phones to block out their constant callings.
Sendy R,Indonesia,Jun 2016,This beach is cleaner than kuta beach. They are a lot of cafe with beanbag. A nice place to wait the sunset. Kiddos love to spend time here. 
janice0311,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2016,"Always love to come here to enjoy the sunset, white sand and the beach really clean. I love Double Six Beach"
Stephanie B,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,Go to K Resto and sit in a beanbag and watch the sunset. The food is great. We had spring rolls and other dishes from their Asean menu. Wonderful food and lovely view.
MeeshellB,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2015,Beautiful spot to sit for sunset drinks. Restaurant and bar area. Comfortable bean bags at some of the restaurant. Relaxed atmosphere. Food is ok. Not fabulous But inexpensive. Good atmosphere. Worth a casual drink in the evening. You will enjoy it. 
kerstin_schweiz,"Zug, Switzerland",Apr 2016,"Very nice and wide beach incl. a wonderful sunset. Nice little and bigger restaurant or bars along the beach. Depends were you are at the beach, there more or less seller. If you like to make a surf course, not problem do it here!"
smilingtravelbug,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Not too rough.  Clean.  Great beach bars to enjoy after a dip :)  A fantastic location on the border of Seminyak and Legian.
DanielEdinburgh34,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Unfortunately this beach not appealing at all. Perhaps I came to the wrong part of Bali! Sunbeds as far as the eye can see with very little space left for an area to lie on with a towel. 
yogibikini,"Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam",May 2016,"Since 2002 I always love this beach. For me , it does not matter if its plenty of people or not so many tourist. I can get relax and chill out easily with the lager depot not so far and Indonesian famous meat balls 20 steps away. Of course some vendors come promoting their things, but I guess it's their job and just ignore politely if you are not interested."
Ang4lia,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Very nice beach, nice view as well, and can not wait to see the sunset everyday from this beach. Highly reccomended"
Lydia R,207 contributions,Jun 2016,"Double Six Beach is a favourite of mine in Bali, not for the swimming though, it's more about the beach bars and people watching. It has a really great atmosphere and plenty of choice if you're looking for a lunch venue or place to chill out for an arvo session."
BrightSide101,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,"This beach with all its bean bags and bars is a treat. A joy during the day and even more wonderful at dusk.Drinks, great food, beach sellers,and the waves lapping at your feet ( as long as you avoid the king tides)"
Janet L,"Greater Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,"As with all things Bali the staff were very accomodating and we were only visitors! My daughter and here young family were here for a week and had a lovely time.Despite the fact that the place was less than two years old, it could look a bit shabby in another year! There was rust and sticking doors, the Bintang was $6.50 in the room bar, so watch out for being fleeced! A good area for shopping and the pool is very nice."
Ausie1944,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,Patrolled beach that is very safe. Double Six has beach chairs for guests with service from the hotel
Neatesy,193 contributions,Jun 2016,"This beach sits at the end of a drain that runs directectly into the ocean..at times it can be very smelly and you really don't want to step in it let alone walk through it...they have now put up a little bridge to help with that but that rancid water runs straight into the ocean and where you swim...it's also very commercialised so loads of vendors asking you if you need a massage, sunglasses, sarong, jewlery etc.."
nickyp888,7 contributions,Jun 2016,Good place to rent surfboards and learn how to surf! The beach is also close to a few nice restaurants and bars that have beanbags and an awesome vibe. Central and easy to find. Bit smelly though!
hrishi2016,"Gurugram (Gurgaon), India",May 2016,"I visited Double Six Beach on recommendation of our hotel's travel desk. The beach is nothing too great, there are several other beaches much better than Double Six Beach in Bali. I would recommend Semiyank Beach for sunset which is much cleaner."
Pat K,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2016,Went down to grab a board and have a go at surfing. Easy to grab a board and rash vest. Plenty of people learning to surf but wasn't overly crowded. Beach isn't the cleanest ever but plenty of room. 
ashwinsingh2908,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,"We only enjoyed the beach in the evenings. The seas were rough during our time as well. However to some degree, i frequent bondi beach and in my view this beach could not be compared. The sand isn't as good or golden however awesome to sit have few beers, enjoy live music and relax in the evening.  "
minah,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"good for children to play sand, running, we can't sit in a chair that pay 100 thousand rupiah within one or two hours , lovit "
miafalatehan,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"One of our favorite beach to walk and admire the sunset. We often take a slow walk from Petitenget Beach to Double Six Beach, the view was worth every step, didn't even get tired or bored. It was an amazing experience."
Wayne L,"Geelong, Australia",Jun 2016,"Come down here for sunsets and drinks before dinnerrelaxed atmosphere and great to people watch,Bean bags on beach"
nimms79,2 contributions,Jun 2016,Was an awesome experience having dinner by the beach with live band. Food n ambience was fantastic! They even offered a free ice cream sundae for my friend's bday celebration. Awesome! Memorable experience!
androidappleos,"Singapore, null, Singapore",Jun 2016,This beach is very peculiar. The sand is blackish brown and super fine. You dont feel the grain of sands rubbing between your toes. It is almost like powder and on top of all this. There are no stones. Imagine that!  The roaring waves are a sight to see and they can be dangerous for kids. Just need to be careful and watch out for riptides.  During the high tide the waves actually reaches the stone walls and sometimes splashing against the side of the pubs.
Chad M,perth,Jun 2016,This place is buzzing from about 5pm onwards. All the small bars bring out bean bags onto the beach and serve food and drinks while you watch the sunset. There is music from live bands and DJ's. Definitely a must do at sunset while in Bali. 
Mandi H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Jun 2016,"Highly over rated. Dirty beach, very ordinary cafe's / restaurants. Not worth the time. Glad we were not staying at one of the beach front hotels. If you want a clean beach go to Jimbaran or Nusa Dua. Even Legian was cleaner than this."
Jacqueline M,79 contributions,Jun 2016,"This beach is crowded and unfortunately dirty. There's lots of litter and there was a certain smell I can't put my finger on. There were many beach vendors as well. The good thing about it is the many bars along the beach. If you prefer somewhere quieter and cleaner, I would suggest Seminyak beach, it's just a short distance away."
Gajadama,"Singaraja, Indonesia",Jun 2016,"Very big waves, so have to be a bit careful but plenty life guards around. Rented two chairs with really nice cushion and umbrella for only IDR 50,000 (for the two). Ordered a cold drink and had a great afternoon!Beach does get crowded two hours before sunset but I kind of liked the buzz after a lazy afternoon."
kletica,"Perth Hills, Australia",Jul 2015,"Stayed here last year and we are staying again this year for a couple of weeks. Great location, great food, our room was more if a suite and was beautiful and had a spectacular view over the ocean with a huge balcony. Close to lots of great Warungs and restaurants. Friendly staff"
xshaun3,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2016,We spent a sunset and a morning on the beach - we think better than Kuta and Legian as not as busy.  Good to hire a board and have a surf.
Fon,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2016,The best place to enjoy sunset in Bali. Enjoying the beach because it was not crowded . A good place to relax 
Rowan M,"Sydney, Australia",Jun 2016,Well it a good place as long as you dont go 1st thing in the morning as every morning thay need to clean the rubbish of the beach that wash up over night it ok but  you will get pushed to buy all.day when you are there and if you lime to lay on a seat you pay for that if you park you motoe bick you pay for that just have lots of smaill money on you 
jrnewson,"Sydney, Australia",May 2016,We visited double six beach in May 2016 and found it to be clean with a very good surf. Their are resturants and bars attached to the rear of the beach and sun lounges and umbrellas are readily available.
Dabangg,"Edinburgh, UK",May 2016,"We went here to have dinner and for a quiet walk. This place is nice and numerous options available to have food. You may find many restaurants who have live bands playing for you. Beautifully decorated, it's nice!"
Katerinka S,2 contributions,Apr 2016,"super cool place, nice soft seats, drinks, sunset time is the best! highly recommended! very clean also, and good for surfing too"
kkwalia,"Chandigarh, India",May 2016,While staying at Horison Seminyak we visited the beach and loved its clear and clean water. Good for surfing
Morison H,30 contributions,May 2016,"Double six beach at Seminyak, Bali is th3 best spot to see sunset in Bali. Many people also held their romantic and memorable wedding ceremony at this beach. Highly recommended this beach for you to spend your holiday in Bali"
Taylor P,"Kuta, Indonesia",May 2016,Great place to sit down on a beanbag and have a few beers while watching the sun go down. Beautiful beach. 
samesdifd,"Darwin, Australia",Apr 2016,"When you walk onto beach look to right and ask for Ozzie and Dee for your beds, table and umbrella. They are great young fellas and will look after you for drinks, alcoholic or otherwise and Ani for your fruit Jack for Henna tattoos and Ola for manicure and jewellrey. Lovely people have known them for years. The lady on the left does sensational Mee or Nasi Goreng for a pittance"
ENNEA,"Caen, France",May 2016,"The place To go absolutely in Bali for sunset. Large beach, a lot of ambiance bars with bands, many people...You can walk at least 10 km from kuta to canggu or even do jogging!"
Wombler661,"Jebel Ali, United Arab Emirates",Sep 2015,"Great spot to rent a sunlounger + umbrella to relax and unwind. Hawkers sell different odds and ends, but generally leave you alone if you show no interest. Food is across the street, and the ocean is great to swim in."
AnaByn,"Makati, Philippines",May 2016,good hangout place with a lot of restaurants to choose from and with bands playing. Nice to watch the sunset here then have dinner around.
Flawlesswonder,"Roselle, NJ",May 2016,The water was clean and the water was so warm. I could have stayed in the water all day.  I appreciated the leather beach chairs and the umbrellas that we rented for a cheap 100k Rupiah. 
mattfrench68,"Colmar, France",Apr 2016,"A good start if you begin your trip in Bali. There are so many options to take surf lessons, rent chairs for the day, found some good restaurants and bars.Mixed of tourists and locals, especially if you have to assist to the sunrise, splendid and peaceful.Otherwise, it is surely not the most beautiful beach in Bali, but is also a nice place for kids."
Richvs1331,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"for those who loves surfing, or just sitting around watching the waves chasing each other, or the magnificent sunset, this is the best hotel that I would recommend you to stay. The breakfast is not only made to order and artistically presented, the taste is really delicious. The hotel is very conveniently located for restaurants, bar and cafes. Shopping is good too, everything is within walking distance. The rooms are spacious and very well laid and the design of the hotel is neat, modern and yet artistic. So, YES I personally vouche"
Yuli H,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2016,"This beach is pretty nice, not busy as kuta bech.. but lots of people selling everything( sometimes it is really annoying).. Great place for drinks, sunset, and chilling with friends. This place is a must go!"
PokeTraveller,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2016,Here is the best sunset spot in Bali. Most of the cafes around has similer concept with a colorful pillow as chair and it's beautiful! 
brittanyontour,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,We were greeted with smiles each morning and the staff really go above and beyond! We only stayed five nights but it really started to feel like a second home! We will most definitely return in the near future. Highly recommended 
mey_htg,"Hong Kong, China",May 2016,Just for adult beach. Never bring your babies here...there are few gay club near it and most of those club visitor went to double six for sunbathing naked. 
Tangogrl,"Montreal, Canada",May 2016,"Fabulous waves to boogie board your heart away and/or learn to surf. However, beach very crowded & not all that clean. Some garbage in the water. Try and avoid the area right next to the small river - it doesn't smell very nice."
Leeanne H,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Fantastic little cafes and restaurants along this beach makes it full of atmosphere.  Can sit back and have a drink, have a bite to eat, watch the kids in the water and then watch the sunset.  After dark most of the beach Cafes have entertainment.  A must do while in Bali!! "
Kiwis_in_the_sun,"Charlestown, Australia",May 2016,Visited in May and unlike other reviews in April we found the beach to be clean of rubbish and the water to be clear like in Australia. Obviously May is a very quiet time in Bali  and our preferred time to visit. The prices are cheaper as everyone is trying to get your business. Highly recommended place to stay in May.
mitchmad1,"Davistown, Australia",May 2016,"great little bars and restaurants all along the beach, can walk to kuta or echo beach on the sand or paved walkways"
207Liz,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"If only the beach was kept clean it would make a huge difference, and that goes for the general area around Legian/Seminyak. There was a lot of rubbish and not enough bins. I did notice locals dumping their rubbish - this is a real shame as it real spoils the landscape and tourists complain. Local authorities need to take action and enforce penalties. Bali is a great place to visit but they need to clean up their act otherwise people won't return."
Teigan F,"Ljubljana, Slovenia",Apr 2016,"We got told by the locals that we would love this place and boy did we. The cocktails on the beach, the live music and atmosphere was amazing! "
Aashaya,"Seminyak, Indonesia",May 2016,I would recommend this restaurant for breakfast.The set menu is good value and for a healthy start the fruit with granola is my choice.I am sure that lunch and dinners would be of the same standard although as we do not live that closeWe usually make it our Sunday morning favourite to catch up with friends.
Cags1960,"Ashington, UK",Apr 2016,"A nice wide beach , hot sand but plenty of beach bars to cool off in. Ideal to watch the sunset but gets a little busy"
Lauren M,"Canberra, Australia",May 2016,"Dirty beach with lots of rubbish. Rough/choppy surf which I wouldn't go into unless I was a strong swimmer, wouldn't allow my children to go in. There are red and yellow flags to indicate safe areas to swim but the life savers don't appear to take their job seriously so it is a bit of a gamble if you aren't confident in strong surf. If you're looking for a nice beach go down south to uluwatu and nusa dewa. I did go for drinks at sunset a few nights though and it was very nice to see the sun set over the water while listening to live music. Also please not in Australian so I'm very used to beautiful beaches!"
Dennis R,"Swansea, Australia",May 2016,We forced ourselves to see the sun rise rather than sleep in. Definitely worth it to join all the many others along the beach. It is much nicer than we thought and gets the cobwebs out of the way in preparation for the day. Time to sleep later
anastasiameivia,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2016,"Thanks to Harris Seminyak Hotel that gives facility to us so we can go to Double Six Beach. Harris Hotel gives us facility in the form of shuttle bus and shedi.We love the beach. My 6 year old cousin also enjoy it. The wave is good, many surfer come here. Love it"
Rachel A,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2016,"Great for a nice sunset, and a bite to eat. Recommend going to Coccon beach club for the two for one cocktails then walking down the beach for the sunset :)"
Salahaldeen  Z,"Amman, Jordan",Apr 2016,"The Double Six beach is a perfect getaway to relax under an umbrella and have a couple of drinks , the waves are medium and the beach is clean just beware of the scammers at the entrance of the beach telling you that you have won a complementary prize , also there are many people trying to sell you stuff on the beach itself.Would return again "
Kerrie W,"Christies Beach, Australia",Apr 2016,"One of my favourite beaches for beach bars, catching up with friends and watching the stunning sunsets"
charles k,Las Vegas,Apr 2016,got a room on ground floor next to pool and great ocean views. everything as described in web picture. the staff were incredibly professional and polite and well trained. breakfast was amazing as was dinner at the 4th floor restaurant. Best service we've had in a long time! highly recommended
Richard C,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,An amazing looking hotel resort with a lagoon pool.We stopped in for a cocktail each which was reasonable priced at $13 
jonytt,malaysia,Jan 2016,not the most spectacular of beaches nor the prettiest but since its there and i was staying near by so thought would pay a visit but its something you would do once and not again
Simon W,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2016,"Ok so firstly we had fun here, hired 3 day beds, surf boards for the kids and had a few drinks on the beach. What did I learn,1. Ask advise from others who look like they have been here before... I did and saved me some $$ 2. Day beds, don't pay over 50k for 1, they will also try and put a time limit on you? Just say no this is for as long as I want. 3. Drinks, I wandered up to a bar and paid full price for drinks first up, watching others I found the guy who rented you the bed will also being you drinks at a cheaper price than the bars. 4. When hiring a surfboard haggle (as with everything else in Bali.. Also don't fall for the 'you have to have lessons to hire this board' if you can surf just say no if will cost you far less. 5. Expect hawkers, you will have people come try to sell you bits and pieces. If your not interested let them know and they will move on. 6. Have fun!! Your in Bali for crying out loud!! "
SavertFamily,"Zeist, The Netherlands",Apr 2016,"We stayed at the Double-Six hotel and loved this beach every day. It is simply stunning with very nice places to drink, eat and lounge."
Timothy B,45 contributions,May 2016,"Having traveled the world this beach is nothing that will take your breath away. One of the most crowded beaches in Bali and not known for its beauty.Ideal for beginner surfers to get their lessons. Not very peaceful as you will be approached by a storm of beach boys and other vendors trying to sell you their products and services. Better to go to Uluwatu, Nusa Dua, Amed, Gianyar, Canggu etc. "
Claire N,"Scarborough, Australia",Apr 2016,"We still love a beer on the beach, we always sit at Aussies bar it's just fun.  We do our souvenir shopping for the kids while we have a beer, massage and buy our fruit.You have to be prepared to be swarmed by the hawkers and be able to get rid of those you don't want to buy from- my method is be really nice and have fun with them but be up front and let them know right away that you're not interested and if you tell them you are then you should buy it from them and not waste their time arguing over 50 cents.  We get the cheapest prices on the beach and the fruit is always fresh and fabulous. It's important to remember this is whats done on the beaches in Bali, you can't be rude to these guys this is just what they do.Its a fun place to meet other travelers and have a chat, share experiences and make plans.Always worth a sit down for a icey cold drink . :-)"
junior g,Singapore,Jan 2016,Nice beach but very busy. Full of beach side bars & cafe with bean bags seating on the beach. Good for drinks and sunset.
Miftakul Huda,Indonesia,Apr 2016,"At least once a in week, i have to visit Seminyak Beach at least for just enjoying sunset with friends chit chat and drinks at the bech as long you are fine with crowded since somes full of people on the weekend. You may choose Meatball it called Bakso in Indonesian for snackin, many places to have chill out during sunset here. Some tourists also love to have tanning here but im prefer going to south for tanning "
krayfi,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2016,"We popped by here to check out the beaches in Seminyak. This is a crowded beach albeit a long stretch and had waves for surfing. We snapped our sunset shots from here, walked the beach for a little and felt it was time to go."
RnRMartin,"Geelong, Australia",Apr 2016,"We love this area of Seminyak.... the atmosphere along the beach is amazing.  Plenty of dining options to suit all budgets, or just relax in a bean bag on the sand and watch the spectacular sunset."
andrew c,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2016,"The beach is awesome,much way better than kuta beach,try to catch a sunset here with a tremendous local food called bakso(meatball) along the beach.if bakso not your thing you can choose an international restaurant surrounding the beach."
TerjeHoegberg,"Oslo, Norway",Aug 2015,"When it comes to enjoying lazy beach life, or enjoying the sunset,  it's much better than the most famous Kuta beach. Less surfers, less beach vendors and less tourists."
Mohamed Abri,"Canberra, Australia",Apr 2016,"Lovely beach with lots of stalls, restaurants, & beach chairs. You can get one of the multiple stalls to get your drinks while you relax."
nanean,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,"A few years ago we were here in the rainy season and it was awful, with rubbish everywhere, washed up by the sea.  This last year, it was lovely, crystal clear water and quite clean.  Nice little beach.  Especially good if you can get there in the early morning (pre 8am).  Locals fishing, local kids playing.  Lovely scene."
tanmalakaadi,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"on my business trip, i was trying to spent time in the late afternoon to release my stress.and I've found a fabulous view in here!"
RBC123,Northern Ireland,Apr 2016,"Water warm and inviting to go swimming, Great waves, lots of people surfing.Just lie back and relax."
June H,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,My name is George Hondris and I recently took my 3 children and there kids to The Double Six. What an experience. All staff from the General Manager down to the pool staff were fantastic. Nothing was too much trouble and we shared 3 bithdays up there and have unforgetable memories that we have taken home regarding this modern State of the Art Hotel.We will be back in September and cant wait. I have been to Bali 51 times and this hotel is the best by far. Give it a try you wont be dissappointed. Excellent view & service.
Brad H,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2015,"Double Six is the go to place for sunset drinks and chilling with friends.  Most places offer bean bags on the beach, free wifi and table service usually with accompanying acoustic bands or techno music. Some spots are better than others so walk around until you find one you like."
Dodde_Mokarisma,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Apr 2016,"I believe the double six beach in one the best spot to enjoy the sunset in Bali, and the world also ! pristine white sands, plenty of food option and the easy access. However the small road and limited parking space for care could be a problem for those we drive here. "
RichytNZ,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Feb 2016,"Head down to Double Six Beach around 5:00 pm in the evening, grab a beer and snack from one of the vendors and relax and watch the sunset"
MiteshK,"Mumbai, India",Apr 2016,"If you're looking for a beach for eating, drinking, live music and some sheesha, this is the place to be..there are plenty of shacks with bean bags that are usually on till 11 PM. Tried other beaches such as seminyak Legian and Kuta..which are otherwise great beaches but only till sunset. "
sammytee069,"Queenstown, New Zealand",Apr 2016,Great little bars/restaurants on this beach with cheap but tasty meals. Fantastic at sunset and a great chilled place to be
DeeceeVictoria,Victoria,Apr 2016,"went to try the roof top bar, went to sit out side and told to sit here you need to spend over $100, but we could sit inside if we like, inside the music was so loud we had to yell, its a huge space which didn't appeal so we left and went to the roof top bar at the Anantara and had a great night. What's also a bit off putting is the evening gowns the staff at the double six roof top bar wear, your on the beach not at a grand gala ball."
Darrin D,"Brisbane, Australia",Apr 2016,I took a long walk from Potato Head down to Cocoon recently on a Saturday afternoon and the views were spectacular. BUt what also struck me was the local use. Indonesian families and children everywhere playing soccer and otherwise coming together to enjoy that natural beauty of this place. Its as if I was being welcomed into the lives of these wonderful and spiritual people. It was a joy to experience. Oh and the sunsets are fabulous.
Teegs30,"Adelaide, Australia",Apr 2016,Great beach to visit but people trying to sell you stuff over and over again is a pain! Stay in the water! Boogey boarding and surfing great!
Dushanthan,"Colombo, Sri Lanka",Apr 2016,The beach is quite big and it has been divided for the surfers separately as well. The beach is quite clean and nice. The bars around the beach are bery good but the they are very cheap as well.
Sulacool,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"very close with seminyak beach and be one bay that place, nice and more quite just for siting and swimming can also enjoying the sunset at afternoon time"
depends on the weather,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2016,"Love the sunset, the smiling people, bintang and beanbags. A bit dirty but its a fun place and even a few good waves."
CharmianG,Melbourne,Apr 2016,"Not bali cheap but great venue and unique, people are lovely and good quality. No problem with the min spend howver 6-7 dollars for a Bintang is a little pricey! Food is excellent quality and will return. Great to see sunset, we arrived at 5pm which was perfect..."
512ren,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Feb 2016,One of many beach in Bali that perfect for viewing sunset. There are also a lot of cafes and bras alongside the beach
bcmum,malaysia,Apr 2016,"Clean beach with deck sun chairs for rent. Relax with the crashing waves sound while the kids enjoy the sand and waters. Music plays as the sun sets,  a bliss with a cocktail prior to dinner."
syortaimer,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"We visited this beach after dinner, so it's a bit late for sunset viewings, but the ambiance was never a letdown. We roamed around enjoying the vibrant beach, listening music from one club to another. When it got late, the clubs were off, the situation's getting more intimate than ever for you can see scenery around and the quiet, calm atmosphere won't let go. Definitely the place if you plan to go night-talking for 2-3 hours to go."
AkhilBiju,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Mar 2016,It's nice beach but the restaurants and the other guys giving the beach beds and other stuff over charge and tend to take people for a ride. Need to haggle extensively
G-HARP-CRAWLEY,Crawley,Mar 2016,"Stunning beach, amazing sunsets - great location. We spent a number of evenings on the beach, watching the sun go down - I guarantee you will get some amazing pictures. You will never get bored of sunsets like this. Great bars along the beach, with live music. I would 100% recommend spending the later afternoon and evening here.! "
lozza193,"Loganholme, Australia",Mar 2016,My husband and I spent a day here and hired 2 day beds with a surfboard for quite cheap. The weather was lovely so it was a nice day and really fun for surfing with a longboard but the amount of people walking along selling you things got a little bit annoying. Some would stop for a good amount of time and just stand in front of you even when you were saying no. Apart from that a nice morning on the beach
puchochot1,"Duxbury, VT",Apr 2016,"We spent a couple of days on Double Six Beach across from the Seaside Mexican restaurant in the Gay-friendly section of the beach.  Look for the small rainbow flag on a poll.  The guys who work on the beach are friendly and attentive.  They moved chairs and umbrellas to make sure everyone in our party was comfortable and fed.  Nothing beats a day on the beach with seaside food and drink service.  Just be sure to wear your sandals, because the sand can be as hot as burning coals."
ramabaskoro,22 contributions,Mar 2016,"Sunset, Beach, Acoustic. Perfect Harmony. Love this beach! My favorit beach spot while i'm in Bali. Only need to take a walk for 10-30 minutes from hotels around Seminyak area.But, hey, where is the Caesar Palace? one of the good cafe in Double Six, replaced by D'Joglo when my last visit."
Tino J,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"White shandy beach, perfect for sun bath & surf. It's only 10 minutes drive from our accommodation Hotel Ibis Styles Bali Petitenget."
Steve T,41 contributions,Mar 2016,"A mediocre beach - not very clean, full of hawkers and hassling sun lounger reps. Lard and tattoos everywhere. Not for me."
badbillybong,Hawaii,Mar 2016,"The beaches (water quality, sand, etc.) from Kuta to  Seminyak are quite dirty. Open sewers floating into the water, garbage galore both in the water and on the beach. If you're looking for light colored sand, clean crystal water, this side of Bali is not where you  will find it. Up and down the beach, you can take surf lessons, rent boards, rent an umbrella and loung chair. And by 5pm or so, the bean bag chairs are pulled out (free to use) and the party atmosphere begins. People playing soccer, music, lights, etc. We found the apres sunset scene to be a lot of fun. During the south swell season, stays offshore until about 10-11am and there's thumping head high ++ beach break...though pretty much walled except for the odd corner/shoulder that forms near the channels. But again, the water is bordering on filthy, disgusting at most spots."
Shirley Wu,"Shanghai, China",Mar 2016,"I have been to this beach 5 years ago. it was ok but not too crowed. last week i have been to Seminyak again so i went to Double six beach to see the sunset. i think like most people said already this beach is nothing special, sea is not beautiful as blue one. if you travel already other seas like Gili island or Phiphi island, please dont expect a beautiful water here. its a beach not very clean even. only thing is the sunset is ok. or if you want to hang out with some friends to have drink in the bars on the beach. otherwise no nothing special here."
amandabenjaminb,Razorback,Aug 2015,Close to everything Seminyak has to offer. We stayed in the 1 bedroom pool Villa and the facilities were 5 star.
daphne928,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2016,"Love this part of the beach as has what ever u want from manicures, massages, food, drinks and u dont even have to move from your beach chair"
Rebecca_andAmir,"London, UK",Feb 2016,This beach was extremely clean and is perfect for enjoying the sunset.  The beach is not too busy and offers the opportunity to surf or sit and eat/ drink.
TIersHasie,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2016,"If you're after a more quiet less busy beach close to Kuta/Seminyak this would be a good choice.The mostly clean and off white sandy beach offers calm waves and a few activities during the day such as horse riding, surfing lessons.At night there is some nightlife but I preferred Seminyak beach for nightlife more."
woojin2016,"Beverly Hills, CA",Nov 2015,"Located in Legian, bit quieter than Kuta. Good place to walk in the morning without having direct sunlight (West coast of Bali)"
Satya R,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2016,The beach is not as busy as Kuta.. Much cleaner with some nice waves too.Only around 10 minutes from kuta and seminyak.
Sunset Lise,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2016,Great to watch the local Bali kids playing beach games and the dogs playing in the water. Love the colourful bean bags and cold beers and cocktails whilst checking out the wares of the street traders. 
ALYSSE16,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Mar 2016,Double six is in a great location for those wanting to experience the real Seminyak atmosphere and night life. The service was excellent and I felt comfortable the entire stay. However the only down side was that my room had a few issues with lighting and technology not working - in saying that the butler had an engineer on site quickly and it was remediated quickly. would recommend for people wanting to experience great hospitality in Seminyak. 
bbrteam,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,"The stylish location has a great vibe. You can book a sunken lounge, but phone at least a day ahead. 1mil minimum spend on food/drink for a sunken lounge booking. Also, make yourself aware of the dress code or you won't be admitted. Various food options avaible, finger food in your lounge, or an Italian meal down stairs in the resturant."
Søren H,"Roskilde, Denmark",Mar 2016,"We went to one of the many beach bars with chairs on the beach, and even on a quite cloudy day the mood is fantastic. The beach itself is quite shallow, but there can be waves depending on the wind direction. The beach is wide well suited for children."
Shridhar_Jaju,"Yavatmal, India",Mar 2016,"The Double Six beach is a very clean beach along that stretch of Bali's coastline that extends from beaches at Kuta to Seminyak.Given that it's the tropics, the sun can be unforgiving during the day and you will need to grab a seat with the shade of an umbrella. You do get a beautiful view of the sunset from the beach. For those interested, the beach makes a very good vantage point to watch flights land / take off at / from the Ngurah Rai Denpasar Bali Airport every few minutes.There are a large number of shacks and small restaurants serving through the day and hawkers will be around everywhere you look trying to sell their wares. One might think of that as a problem, but they don't trouble you much if you've said a firm 'no'.The evenings see a rise in the crowd - locals and foreigners alike. You will see people trying to surf on the waves, play a game of football on the beach, take walks alone / with their dogs, and just doing a wide variety of activity all along the beach. On the whole, it's a wonderful place to relax for a few hours in Bali."
Richard W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Love to just lay around relaxing in the sun just watching the day go by not a care in the world , the way a holiday should Be . Yes there is hawkers everywhere but that's Bali love it or hate it they are just doing there job. "
David E,"Legian, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Bali's west coast has no shortage of beach spots. In fact, it's almost one endless beach strip for kilometers on end. However, of course, every area has it's own charm.For me, Double Six Beach is one of the best spots on the Island. One of the particular features is an abundance of nice beach bars which are especially great for sunset drinks, most of them equipped with bean bags for comfy seating, some of them have DJs, others live music. It's a very lively scene and there is a huge selection of excellent restaurants and beach clubs in the surrounding Seminyak neighborhood.Like in many other places, there are lots of surf schools around - its a good wave!All in all, perfect spot for sunset drinks and chill-out at the beach, a good win or surf - anything goes..."
Jo C,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2015,Tekor Bali on the beach frount at Double six is a great place to eat at sunset great for fish and chips plus Arak Madus
Ferida H,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2016,Our Villa was only 400 meters to the beach. went there everyday to watch the sunset and have some drinks with friends. Great beach for surfing and swimming. The water was very warm. You have beach chairs and  umbrellas to watch the night away with plenty of music and live bands. Excdellent
Vicknesh K,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2016,A beautiful beach with colours and a great sunset to unwind with cold beers or cocktails. Can be a perfect romantic evening with your loved one or just a great bonding time with friends! This place is a must go!
ElleForder,"London, UK",Feb 2016,Had such a chilled time listening to the live bands on the beach play whilst enjoying the yummy cocktails!We lit fire lanterns and made a wish - hope it comes true!
Axle H,7 contributions,Mar 2016,"Again I was a little disappointed at double six beach when I visited it had rubbish strewn all over, there was a tractor attempting to clean but it just seemed to be moving sand, I prefer to head up to Legian beach where why there is some mess locals seem to clean up a lot "
31081957,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2016,Great from spending the day at the beach to sunset drinks and dinner. Great music. A great pop in or you can stay all night.
Russell M,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2016,My wife and I enjoyed a couple of meals and some afternoon drinks  while watching the great sunsets. only problem is the overly loud music coming from Cocoon which spoilt the music from beach performers.
Petrina Y,Singapore,Jan 2016,Love the cafes on the beach front. Perfect for lazing the days away. Particularly breathtaking at night. A million times better than Kuta! Clean an beautiful beach!
Mike T,Newcastle upon Tyne,Feb 2016,"Beautiful beach, very popular with beach games and lots of mainly young people. Security guards are very evident plus the food was good and reasonably priced."
Angel Seraphina,"Yogyakarta Region, Indonesia",Mar 2016,"Clean place and you can enjoy swimming and surfing in the beach with quiete friendly wave :D :D .. good place to enjoy the sunset ""when is not cloudy :D "
starkerama,"Alberta, Canada",Feb 2016,"We were SO disappointed with this beach. We were in Seminyak for 4 days hoping to surf and play in the water and we didn't dip a toe in once. Bulldozers would clean the beaches of garbage every morning, and it would continue to wash up all day. Truly disgusting and so sad. We've been to Kuta and Legian before and had never seen anything like this. We were told it comes on the tides from Java..."
kasalamd,"Marikina, Philippines",Feb 2016,"A stone's throw away from our hotel, this beach had beige grayish sand and was therefore, not too cool on bare feet. Still, our stay under the umbrella shades was quite relaxing.  Huge waves most enjoyable for surfers and for those who just like to ride on the waves! "
Dale W,"Mornington Peninsula, Australia",Mar 2016,"Fortunately our hotel had a private area which allowed us to sun -bake comfortably.  That was the only highlight.The beach was riddled with plastic, paper and unmentionables.A drain was free-flowing into the sea causing brown waves that put most people off. Putting up with the beach vendors wasn't too bad, given that this is their only form of income.This beach is not somewhere I would advise anybody to swim at!"
Robbert,"Amsterdam, The Netherlands",Feb 2016,"great to hang out on the beach, catch a wave or enjoy one of the nice restaurants on the beach or on the boulevard"
Gay T,"Brisbane, Queensland, Australia",Jan 2016,This beach is beautiful and particularly gorgeous in the evening when the sun is setting.  Very nice also in the mornings for a nice walk.  
Polly199,60 contributions,Feb 2016,awesome selection of restaraunts and bars! Great place to unwind and relax in Seminyak!  Family friendly location
Kathirmathi V,19 contributions,Feb 2016,We arrived in the late afternoon in an effort to escape the hot sun. The most beautiful sunset was presented to us by nature. 
Chris-Bj-brisbane,27 contributions,Feb 2016,Great beach with perfect sunsets. Each area could try and clean up the rubbish that collects on the beach. some areas do a great job while others not so good. 
abangbala,"Bogor, Indonesia",Feb 2016,"Really nice to visit, waiting for sunset with a bottle of beer or somekind of drink. Talking about anything, with live music. Very joyful. "
John D,"Barnstaple, UK",Feb 2016,"We have visited this beach are now twice in the last three months, staying for a week on both occassions.  The last time it was clear that the local authoritiy were struggling to keep the sand clean.  However I am more concerned that the water quality is very poor which is a real shame as the surf can be pretty good.  The open drain outlets appear to run directly into the sea, along the whole lenght of the beach.  I suspect this is a health issue (serious).  I would love to be told told otherwise."
summerbeachguy,"Queensland, Australia",Feb 2016,Take your pick on dining and drinking locations along here. There are plenty. A great spot to watch the sunsets and grab a nice light meal whilst laying in a bean bag on the beach itself under a lamp-lit beach umbrella with hundreds of others surrounding you and your friends.Life is good when you take a moment and absorb where you are!
Roger,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2016,"East access down a narrow lane, not crowded with clean white sand and safe sea.  Less packed than some of the other beaches."
Reea_ria,"Jakarta, Jakarta Raya, Indonesia",Feb 2016,Nice place for having such a relax time and hanging out with friends. The sands was quite clean but there are some dogs around the beach. Good waves for surfers.
SedaEg,Istanbul,Aug 2015,The food options on this side of Seminyak beach are more international from tacos to pork ribs. However the beach itself is nosier and not as clean. Just take a walk down to Legian and both the ocean and beach will satisfy your vacation needs better.
EgleDesigns,"Shanghai, China",Feb 2016,"We came here to do some surfing. It's excellent for all levels, but be careful of the rips and pull of the water. Very strong, but fantastic time spent surfing. Lots of sun loungers, surf board rental places, bars etc."
Kat59623,United Kingdom,Apr 2015,Nice place for relax during a day and lively spot for the nights out. Great and clean beach. Packed up with surfers.
Thalia_RR,"New York City, NY",Jul 2015,DS beach is a great way to end your hectic day or meet up with friends after a long day of riding around on your bike!  There are a variety of simple places to hang out sit on  a bean bag with friends (or alone ) on the beach to watch the beautiful Bali sunset! this is what life is all about !
lesley s,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Feb 2016,"We walked  about a couple of k's from where we were staying to this beach as it was cleaner by far than Jepun Beach the sand was not as black either and more bars/restaurant's to chose from. We went in 10/2/16 a festival day in the Balinese calender and so many Balinese were leaving offerings along the beach which really added to the litter already strewn along the shore, we even saw a dead half buried chicken! It would be great if the Balinese could get onto the rubbish problem in general, when it rains the drains all block and results in flooding too. We were  told a lit of the rubbish on the beach cones from the PHILLIPINES??"
ruthojen,"Baltimore, MD",Feb 2016,"Depressing , filthy, proof that tourism destroys culture.nit should be a call to arms to have proper recycling in Bali and that each hotel should have a plan in place. It is a floating garbage can. "
Jason S,"Scamander, Australia",Jan 2016,"Every time I come to Bali I spend most evenings on the beach to watch the sunset.There is always something happening, Sports / WeddingsMany bars that have cold drinks, food & live musicI love grabbing a bean bag and just chilling for a few hours before heading off on a big night"
Linda P,"Bali, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Double six beach is one of my family ""sunset spot"" place.The cleanes, the cafe arround, the ambiance were very nice."
Martin A,"Gingin, Australia",Feb 2016,"On our last day of our stay in Bali we headed down to the beach where our hotel had a beach club (basically chairs, towels and umbrellas). At first glance the beach is beautiful with a few restaurant/bar options. What we found as we went for a swim was the sand and the water inundated with rubbish, mainly plastic. We did have a big storm yesterday with loads of rain so I am not sure if the rubbish problem is exacerbated by stormwater discharge into the ocean which is likely. The black beach sand is like mud when wet and sticks to everything. We left shortly after and headed back to our hotel pool. "
Shazrazmataz,"Adelaide, Australia",Jan 2016,"This beach is dirty & smelly, there's litter everywhere & lots of stray dogs.The only positive is that it has great sunsets."
IntrepidNomad,"Urandangie, Australia",Jan 2016,The beach is beautiful at sunset and the Balianese at sunrise send the cleaning machines in to clean up all the debris that has been left behind or floated in. This beach is nice and wide and great for wandering along or going for a run.
Jean B,"Kensington, Australia",Jan 2016,Maybe because it's Sunday so it was full of people. The beach is looking better & more clean compare to Kuta beach. Mostly local people or local tourist. It has comfy seating area in many cafes at the beachside with live accoustic band performance when we're seeing sunset. Lovely time!
preplady,Virginia,Jan 2016,We took maybe a 3-mile walk here.  It's very pleasant & amazingly quiet for a beach in a touristy area.  There are lots of restaurants & bars & places to take surfing lessons & the surf looked great!
BigJoan66,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2016,A nice place to stop off before dinner for a quick drink or two whilst watching the beautiful sunsets. 
Larry0807,"Townsville, Australia",Dec 2015,"Get down to Won's beach bar just in front of the Kumala Pantai Hotel, great service, ice cold beer and the small warung on the beach serves fresh, cheap lokal food."
Helen L,"London, UK",Jan 2016,"Great beach to get some body board waves equal to Cornwall but 20 degrees warmer.Beach hire subbed and board so cheap...beach vendors no hassle, just say no...nicely Some great waves for those who don't go out of their depth and just want fun in the sea."
ddarwen,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,There are many shops here along the beach selling food and drinks. There are peddlers around selling from steam peanuts to kites. Stalls here set up lounge chairs and umbrellas by the beach for patrons to sit and chill. Waves were not to big but there were a few people surfing. It was a nice place to just chill with friends drinking coconut juice and watch the sunset. 
Danielle,"Orem, UT",Jul 2015,"This beach reminds me of the ones back home in California. Except for one fact, the waves here are HUGE. Perfect beach to catch some surfing or boogie boarding. They have so many people renting out surfboards and boogie boards for a reasonable price. You can even get a surf lesson from the locals. Plenty of bars along the beach, no way you'd get hungry. There's lots of cute stray dogs walking around. There are many hagglers who will offer you some pretty cool trinkets. They're not too pushy. Just expect it everywhere you go. Remember they're human and just trying to support their families is all."
Donna B,"Bunbury, Australia",Jan 2016,This beach is awesome with lovely wavesBe aware of strong undertow especially weak swimmersBeach was pristine clean no rain to wash in waste Would recommend this areaGreat beach shacks with music and food
Kay549,"Reading, UK",Apr 2015,"Wonderfully clean when I visited, though apparently ocean currents can wash litter on to the beach at some points of the year. "
himeshinra,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2016,"Kuta Beach is just way too crowded and way too many pushy hagglers. The people in Double Six beach are nicer and most of the sellers are not too pushy and more polite, but you have to negotiate your way for lower prices even though they're offering prices lower than Kuta Beach. Still, you can definitely R&R in this beach. Good for couples as this beach is one of the popular dating spot in Bali. In the evening the beach gets more crowded by locals and families and dogs, and you can move to one of the bean bags at the seaside cafe and watch the sunset with live music and margarita. "
Norine007,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2016,lovely clean beach with good vibes watch out for the hawkers can be annoying. many cafes and places to drink and eat. you can go cheap or you can ramp it up a bit whatever your taste.
新加坡林峰,Singapore,Jan 2016,"Visited the beach around 5pm. Parking the bike by the beach pavement cost u 2k IDR, sat down at one of the restaurants, ordered a beer and sat down to enjoy the sunset. There is also live band in front at the beach, where one can relax at the beanbags with a beer in hand, a pizza and enjoy the sunset. Woah...Went into the sea and enjoy the waves at you. There are rental of surf boards available. Overall good relaxing experience..."
ratan3,"Bengaluru, India",Feb 2015,Had been to double six beach. Less tourist and wonderful clean and neat beach. Best to lay around on a lazing evening
Sarvs F,Te Atatu,Jan 2016,We stopped off at the Blue 9 Beach bar and it was a lovely relaxing way to spend a quiet afternoon after a whole day of sightseeing.They were setting up the speakers for a night of entertainment and unfortunately we didn't stay long enough to enjoy but we got there at a good time in the afternoon to secure seats as I am sure it would pack up quickly.  The bean bags are uncomfortable though so some new biggers one wouldn't go astray.  We did sit at a table also but for an evening with cocktails to take in the evening entertainment you need to be on the bean bags!Good and friendly service.  We ordered a chicken pizza which literally had one small piece of chicken on each slice and the crust was tough.  Go for the drinks and environment not necessarily the pizza.
melmitchell_melb,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2015,We were here in July - and it was beautiful.  Came back in December and it was almost knee-deep in rubbish.  Just disgusting.  The Balinese claim that it's a naturally occurring seasonal event (there's a sign on the beach to this effect).  More like rubbish being washed down with the rains.  Such a shame as it is a beautiful beach - it would be good if they could do something about it.
Jaad87,13 contributions,Jan 2016,"Really comfy sunbeds for 50k. Not the cleanest beach in the world, but in general people don't know what to do with rubbish in Bali. Many locals come after 5pm (when it is less hot) to enjoy the beach and watch the sunset. Many hagglers trying to sell you stuff - just pretend you're sleeping!!!"
ichembilath,29 contributions,Jan 2016,"The view of the sunset from here was awesome! It wasn't heavily crowded when I got there but the place tends to be crowded at times, nevertheless it's a great place to be. Well maintained, clean and the locals are quite friendly. A note though, drinks bought from the beach maybe costlier than buying outside!"
irresistibal,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"This beach is considered as one of the most famous and most visited in Bali, the reason being is that the beach has a long stretch and wide stone-coloured soft-sandy beach.A famous bakso (meat balls - local streetfood) stall by the name ""gerobak biru"" just across Kumala Pantai Hotel is a must-have items while enjoying the sunset over there."
MarkKarenEllie98,"Melbourn, UK",Jan 2016,"My kids went surfing there, guys on the beach hiring surf boards and offering lessons for $30 Australian for 2 hours"
nicola,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2016,"What a way to spend a day or afternoon,relaxing on the beach under an umbrella,laying back on a sun lounge,watching the sunset,whilst having a drink brought to you.Locals take good care of you."
Andy G,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"The beaches should be so much cleaner. It's a pity as it detracts from the Bali experience. When walking along one has to watch out for all manner of rubbish, dog crap and general flotsam and jetsam, plus the open drains running into the ocean."
amin a,25 contributions,Dec 2015,"this beach is over crowded, they dont have good management in waste, its to many garbage in their sand and also they overcharged the food, quality of food is also not good at all"
Trisha M,Kinross WA,Dec 2015,It may have been because of the rainy season but when you walked into the water you could feel and see so mush rubbish floating around - the water was lovely and warm but we couldn't go into it - we know that the locals do their best to keep it clean but it just keeps washing up - the water further north of 66 beach is a lot cleaner and clearer
joceey,"Torquay, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great views of the beach and sunset, free entry so great just to go and have a look around. Had a wallet stolen on NYE and staff went above and beyond to get it back. Bar service however was terrible, one girl on the til so 45min waits, hopefully it was just a NYE issue."
Erlintirto,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Dec 2015,A perfect beach for watching the romantic sunset while you enjoy a cold beer in their cafes. For my teens they crazy for surfing all day time. In night you could enjoy the live music in each cafe with ur fam or friends.
Markie17,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2016,"Amazing sunsetNice beanbags by the beach Sun, sand, sea, waves, kids playing soccer, vendors selling sky lanterns, fireworks, singers.. And not very expensive. Beach is abit dirty yes, but sunset alone is worth the visit "
kmtnmm,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2016,"The vibe here was magical.  Wonderful beach; pretty clean, great temperature, hari krishnas dancing up the sand with santa clause hats on, great food.  Just go."

sugiphang,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"the beach with a lot of sunset cafe, very crowded for enjoy the sea and sun. but little bit dirty. loves to morning run at the beach, and doing a good time with buddies."
rodrigoelp,"Sydney, Australia",Dec 2015,"Between the plastic bags and other rubbish in the water and on the sand the illusion of a paradise island was quickly shattered. It was really disappointing upon arrival to the point my partner didn't want to take a seat on the sand for a little while (after a 25 minutes walk under the blazing sun and suffocating heat).Saw a surfer coming out of the water with the southern cross tattooed on his shoulder (Aussie mark), asked him how good was the water and replied ""got it going for a bit, then lost it when three plastic bags got tangled to my leg, right now I am going to wash the frustration it down"""
Virag2811,"Ahmedabad, India",Dec 2015,the place is at good location. nice hotel. we just went to chill out. view from the roof top was spectacular just like place. visit it once and have a drink. only veg food option was potato wades/fries.
caron s,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Visitors have trashed the place, sadly. Great surf and board rentals, lessons are cheap and plentiful."
FLT1904,"Mittagong, Australia",Dec 2015,"We have swum at Double Six Beach for numerous days and the first day was fabulous, but then there was a bit of rain and the next day the beach was covered in rubbish , on the beach, in the water. We returned a few days later and still rubbish, then it seemed to improve. Apart from the rubbish the beach was good."
BrianC5,"Vancouver, Canada",Dec 2015,Sorry but I am tired of saying no to vendors who do not listen and continue to harass me and others who are just trying to relax on the beach and enjoy a Bintang.
Kimtikawaka,"London, UK",Dec 2015,We visited the beach 5 days before Christmas and had to sit on sun loungers a few feet away from a tide of trash that had washed up on the sands. People were having to walk amongst it and over it to get to the sea. It was absolutely filthy and stretched right along the beach. I can't believe this is one of the main attractions of the area. I see that other people have left very good reviews so I imagine the beach must be cleaned at certain times of year. I won't be recommending this to anyone I'm afraid. 
Mukta A,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2015,"Very nice beach, full of fun and peace. Nice location. 24*7 shop is there for everything you need. must visit"
Selena39,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2015,"Nice beach for afternoon drinks or food. Definitely not the golden sands of our Australian beaches, but great for a refreshing dip with the added character of beach bars. The street hawkers are there but very polite and no hard sell. Beautiful sunsets."
Ryw Surf Lesson B,"Bali, Indonesia",Dec 2015,"Surf Lesson, Surf Photography, Surf Trip.Enjoy the waves in Double Six Beach.. With our surf instructor and ride your wave, we will capture your moment stand up on surfboard."
FleecySqueezyFizzy,"Singapore, Singapore",May 2015,"Nice view but too crowded. I prefer quiet beach where i can enjoy the space, the ambience and admire the sea."
Sonia D,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,When you visit Double six beach be sure to stay for a drink a dusk. They set up bean bags and tables on the shore and you can enjoy a drink whilst watching the ocean and people watching. The guys that look after you are amazing and only too happy to look after your needs. Most of the cafes and restaurants serve great cheap food.
kellysherry,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,fun and atmosphere great. close to lots of drinks and food. Massages and the water. can rent sunlounge at a reasonable rate
Aussie D,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,There is loads of things to do on this beach and it would be a good beach to learn surfing on for the beginner.
SunilNambiar,"Bengaluru, India",Nov 2015,"Double Six beach was just a short walk away from where we stayed in Seminyak. The beach is clean & flat and the waves just right to have fun with. There were red flags at parts indicating strong undercurrents. The beach had vendors all along renting out sundeck chairs and umbrellas. We didn't opt for these as it was already nearing sunset. Local Kids playing football made a refreshing sight - and you could join in if you wish to. The beach is lined with a variety of restaurants - with almost all having a podium in front with the back facing the sea, and good singers crooning out popular pop numbers. The lane just adjacent yo the beach too had several nice eateries. A great night life spot in Seminyak."
ong_giri,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2015,"nice place just relax on the beach and get full sun shine or get swim on the beach  or you could go for surfing , just nice in seminyak beach."
Micheal E,"Cairo, Egypt",Dec 2015,"This is the best Bar/restaurant on the beach, best time to be there is around sun set. Its one of the places you must visit during your stay in Bali. "
A2535ATjohnw,"Adelaide, Australia",Dec 2015,"Been here a couple of times. Its a nice beach, plenty of places to eat from cheap to expensive. Hawkers offer to sell you things, just politely say no and they move on. Not to big a surf. Family friendly"
drew_m_johnston,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2015,"Great beach with large sand breaks. Plenty of places to eat along beach, board hire and hawkers. One can even ride horses on this beach."
Stefanwar,France,Nov 2015,"First the location is incredible, lots of people, great flat beach and easy to go in the sea to play with the waves...(not the cases on all beaches). We rented body surf board for 50.000 rp the hour, quite alright but the sundeck chairs with umbrella are ridiculously expensive, after bargaining really hard we got 3 chairs for 200.000 rp, it was already 2 .30pm went we showed up and at 4.30pm she asked us to leave as the bar adjacent was setting up for the cocktail hours...total rip off. Next time I will go a little further away. Excellent location to listen to music and enjoy the sunset !!"
travellerone28,"Swansea, UK",Oct 2015,"Don't be put off by persons selling paintings, I bought three for approx 25 pound and was offered 150 each on my return to UK ! A lovely beach and setting highly recommended"
Batchy94,"Darwin, Australia",Dec 2015,"I went down for a walk to double six beach for a look one morning, and I was quite impressed on the cleanliness of the beach, beautiful sand lounge chairs everywhere a few people trying to sell bracelets etc.. Despite that a great place to come for the day "
Thomas Hynes H,18 contributions,Dec 2015,Easy day on the beach - reasonably priced sun lounges with good drink service Water was perfect temperatureAlso great for a long jog along the beach
lalith1,"Panjim, India",Nov 2015,"This beach is famous  for its long stretch of clean beach.  Centrally located, it can be reached on foot . Popular with foreigners and tourists. "
Nieken29,"Tangerang, Indonesia",Nov 2015,More better then kuta beach...you sould visited..and on this beach there is cafe/restaurant for chill out with live music when sunset comes..
Paul,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2015,Nothing special really. Check it out if you'd like but there's nicer beaches further north. Lots of rubbish washes up at nighttime.
Fiona L,"Avoca Beach, Australia",Nov 2015,We just went to the bar!  Fabulous view.  Very modern and cool bar!  Wonderful mojitos!!  We went on a Tuesday night 2  for 1 prices!! Dangerous!!  Also BEST EVER popcorn chicken.  Delicious!
Ryder G,"Greater London, UK",Dec 2014,"We arrived at about 4pm, just as the sun was making its decent. Beach was busy, but there was plenty of room for people to move about without feeling that one was stepping on eachother's toes. Lots of activities going on along the beach from sports to family & couple gathering to impromptu food stalls and delicious sate grills. Spent about an hour there watching the sun go down and having a little paddle in the sea, before making our way back to our Villa transport that was waiting in the car park. All in all a nice break from all the shopping in Seminyak "
ridha w,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"My favourite place is here. DOuble six beach, I can do jogging, watch people play football , many tourist and local enjoy the beach. many cafes in here so no worries if we are hungry. "
Joan31100,"Toulouse, France",Nov 2015,"Very good spot, and eazy to access but this beach is to crowdy... You can see much better beach in bali by taking your scooter ony 15min, and if you are eazy on scooter, go to the Bukit ! Uluwatu, Dreamland, Impossible, Bingin... So much better !"
Carine P,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2015,"This beach isn't wowwwwww...its always full of families, its good for those who wanna learn how to surf, or is travelling with kids. Btw i have to warn that the water is sooooo cold, and there are a lot of option for places to eat, or just chill out and enjoy the beach."
Birgit K,"Munich, Germany",Nov 2015,"Impressive waves thundering onto the beach, which makes it a gr at surf spot, also for beginners. Deckchairs under umbrellas for rent, don't pay more than 100'000 IDR per day. Only ennerving are the constant flow of sellers coming buy......"
trishr798,"Newcastle, Australia",Nov 2015,Disappointed  nice location but felt food was overpriced and over cooked bacon rock hard eggs over cooked asked for soft and where hard Fresh fruit platter was tasty Felt it was a letdown considering our hotel provides a nicer breakfast included in stay 
tinesimanjuntak,"Bandung, Indonesia",Nov 2015,Sunset is so beautiful when I came. Really enjoyed watching sunset and sitting at the beach since they provide benches. However I don't really like the crowds.
ohclaramia,"Bunbury, Australia",Oct 2015,"Walking on this strip life is buzzing, beach live music, restaurants,with the warm temperatures life couldn't be any better"
Theasamiadji,101 contributions,Jul 2015,"comparing to Kuta Beach, this place is a little bit quite so you can enjoy and relax. Dont forget to buy Rujak Bali, traditional food sell by local people :)"
db9x,Indonesia,Nov 2015,"if you love to get tan, well you might be like this place. perfect place to spend time with friends during sunset, surfing (and oh i saw lots of sufring class sign -if you wanna learn this thing-). or drinks at the cafe all the way down. i came here alot because i love the clean beach and it's easy to find food :)"
Marwan83,146 contributions,Nov 2015,"Compared to Australia and the Red Sea, it is a poor beach. Only surfers would enjoy it. Not bad cafes and bars on the beach but alcohol prices is a bit high because of the location. "
marianne b,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,"Spent a lot of time in the beach shacks on double six . These are a great place to kick back and listen to some music, beach is clean. quite enjoyable"
Adsandme,31 contributions,Nov 2015,Went to see the sunset and had a drink at one of the beach bars and sat on the bean bags.. It was great seeing the waves and surfers. Then the music is blaring in all directions.. From the bars next to you as well as the one your sitting in which ruined the mood completely .. The beach isn't too clean and dirty compared to others
Kazcob,"Terrigal, Australia",Oct 2015,"Lovely hotel, great staff excellent restaurants.  Nothing was a trouble.  Very impressed would definitely stay here again"
Vee A,114 contributions,Oct 2015,"Didnt enjoy it as much during the day. The beach is a bit dirty along the sand and the water not clear. Waves are kind of rough, perfect for surfies I guess. At night,  hubby and I spent at least 5 hrs from sunset onwards, going from beach bar to beach bar sipping on cocktails and trying tapas. Locals sell stuff to you, lanterns, bangles, glow lights, kites you name it. Not a big deal at first, but one can only buy so many bangles in one night. The one man live bands are entertaining and we fell asleep at times, not sure if from the $4 smirnoff bottles or from their singing. Still, I loved hanging out there, I think I miss that most."
gael d,"Semarang, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Don't expect to take a rest on this beach. You will be harassed by boring people trying to sell you crappy paintings, cheap laser pointers or bad massage. They will come and try again every single minute..."
simon_macc,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,The most relaxing way to sit back at the end of the long day and watch the sunset. With a couple of Bintangs on the beach with the camera ready for that sunset shot.....
Mags132,"Brisbane, Australia",Nov 2015,They areas that get cleaned are ok but some areas not so good. Fun beach bars and restaurants line the beach but not the prettiest beach in Bali
Lizcurrier,"Billingshurst, UK",Oct 2015,"If you don't mind being hassled by beach sellers ( they are actually really nice and funny ) this is a good beach. The sunbeds are very comfy and have nice large umbrellas with them.Without leaving our sun beds we bourght sunglasses, had delicious fruit for lunch , a welcome ice cream ( nicely frozen still ) and enjoyed a massage.Wonderful sunsets."
Stefanii_Wjy,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Double six beach is an amazing place for waiting and watch sunset. we can choose one of the restaurant there. some of the restaurant provide music or (sometimes) live music to accompany us enjoy our evening.
HungryFriend,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2015,This beach is well-known for it's food. Along the beach there are many Cafe that provide beverages with Sea and Sunset view. Really nice place to spend afternoon while watching the surfers and the view. 
me020392,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Double six beach is one of gorgeous beaches in Seminyak. Relax your mind and bury your feet under the warm sand. Hey! You're the only Indonesian I guess!
Natalie K,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,Double six is the most happening place to be in Seminyak.  Beach activities are good.  Food is great.  Some really good quality shopping in Seminyak too.  Worth a trip when in Bali.
Bruce R,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,As a guest of Double Six Hotel we could also use the deckchairs by the beach spent a couple of hours each day just sleeping and watching the views just great.
Sn00py66,Darwin NT,Oct 2015,"We love to eat at all the different restaurants along this strip.Watching ""the Gadget Guys"" showing off their goods for sale is always amuzing.Sunset is lovely too."
puchka,"Bengaluru, India",Oct 2015,"We visited the beach for a dinner date.   The entire Beach has eating joints each one vying for attention over the other, making it difficult to choose a place to eat.  Most of the beach front restaurants have their sit out areas on the beach under cover of umbrellas.  Surfing boards are available for the water sports enthusiasts.  Beach chairs with towels for the sunbathers and in the evening a lot of entertainment to go with food and wine.  A real fun place !"
Tracy f,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Sep 2015,everything at your feet massage sunset beanbag resturants music entertainment cocktails surf lovely locals 
Putu S,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"Double six beach is not a very clean beach, though it is one of the best places to learn how to surf since there are no corals or rocks. The waves are also ranging from 2m down to as small as it can be. I wouldn't recommend this beach to do anything else because the water from the sewage comes out just at the centre of this beach, so it smells and gets pretty dirty most of the times."
Pauline J,"Launceston, UK",Oct 2015,"We visited Seminyak & did plenty of walking, relaxing, reading & sleeping on this beach.Saw some reviews prior to visiting that put me off slightly, but it's got soft golden sand (that gets very hot) plenty of sun loungers, great views down to Legian & Kuta & you can see the planes land at the airport...watching them taxi down the runway looks like their ontop of the sea...very odd.We had a surf lesson with one of the surf schools, and the conditions were perfect for us. Sadly that day was the only day out of 4 that the conditions were good...as there were a few strong rips & the wind was in completely the wrong direction. Ah well, what can you do!Slight downside is the pushy old ladies wanting to massage you & the lookie lookie men who pester some what... don't let them bother you! Just a polite no & some ignoring seems to work.Sun loungers you could rent for the whole day...we ended up paying around 100k for the whole day... which was just less than a fiver.We personally found the restaurants along the back of this beach overpriced and nothing special... one or two of the beach bars were fun although they all seemed to have live singers on the beach which would sing over their neighbouring bars act...not the most relaxing thing to listen too...All in all good times spent on this beach!"
Andrew S,"Jimbaran, Indonesia",Oct 2015,Always full of people and the waves are great for surfing.  The sunset is also visible from here.  A few F&B land marks around here including Chez Gado Gado and Anantara Hotel
Julie E,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,"Great lbeach and umbrellas  available,  a choice of different restaurants on beach available with a reasonable area for family to swim and relax and have the choice of getting a drink and food near by.  Only toilet was in the restaurant if required but need to purchase something to use it."
mskatie1959,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Scattered bars with reasonable beer prices. Live music at night. Street vendors to buy yummy food from. Relaxing during the day, busier at night.  Love it. I will be staying closer to it on my next trip back in December."
ScooterOz,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2015,"Seminyak Beach is one of the nicer beaches to visit. There are several beach clubs but it is not too crowded with them and the surf is good. The beach is patrolled and flags are put up in the morning. There are a couple of surf schools operating there. Good location for restaurants etc. there are ATMs including an ANZ one, two mini marts. At night the beach comes alive in a nice family friendly way before the sun goes down."
Jan P,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2015,Great beach with very big waves.  Good for surfing not so great for swimming as it is a bit dangerous with the current.
PJbig,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Sep 2015,Many different Beach Bars from the more basic ones in Legian to the built up ones in Seminyak (personally I prefer the basic ones for atmosphere and personalised service). 
yesdes,Melbourne,Jan 2015,"Not sure what the fuss is about. I found the beach dirty, littered with rubbish. Not great when you want to take a leisurely walk or dip. Next time I'll stick to Nusa dua."
Marie A,27 contributions,Jul 2015,"Good value, but you do get what you pay for. Worth the experience as it has great ambience right on the beach. Lots of choices and very casual and relaxed."
AustralianSlush,"Greater Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,Amazing - cannot wait to return again and again!!!!!!Double Six staff & amenities are second to none.....luxury at it's best!!
Amine T,13 contributions,Oct 2015,"cool and enjoyable beach to watch and relax the sunset time, lot of coffees ,bars and  restaurants around and along the beachanytime visiting Bali , double six beach is a must visit place "
HXNNXH,"Darwin, Australia",Oct 2015,"Came here in December 2014 with a girl friend and brought my boyfriend here with me this time. From the moment I laid eyes on this beach, I fell in love. The music, the sand and sea and waves. The wind. The fairy lights and colourful umbrellas. It's basically a whole stretch of beach bars. I think they're all pretty similar and have quite a range of drink selections. I usually go right before sunset and stay on for a couple of hours after. I would recommend picking a place with a live band. Can't get any better than a live band on a beach, with a cocktail (or bintang) in hand. Was pretty romantic. "
MatthewTheCatthew,"Fukuyama, Japan",Oct 2015,"Double Six Beach can only be described as the epitome of paradise. Endless sole soothing sand to sooth your soul as you stroll along and take in a sunset which forces even the most cynical among us to fall in love again with this world of ours. Beanbag restaurants complete with live musical entertainment, all by candlelight and the warming glow of the setting sun provide the perfect way to spend an evening in easily one of my favourite places in our natural world."
Hailey N,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2015,"Perfect spot to watch the sunset. Located in seminyak, good vibe around sunset . During the day there are lots of sun beds and before sunset they all get packed up and out come the colourful bean bags and umbrellas. Heaps of different bars to choose from along the stretch, with good food and drinks, and some with live music. "
Christoo M,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2015,"Double sex beach(66 beach) its good and nice pleace and good for surf aslo and in the afternoon you can come to see the sun set a wail have a botol of bintang,and aslo you can have a full body massage there,or you aslo can call the therapist to give you a good massage in your hotel or villa after from beach."
HowardDG,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,Great for sun tanning and great restaurant's on the sand which deliver F&B to your day beds .The beach sand is cleaned from rubbish washed up from the sea every morning and you welcome to give a hand around 6am when I'm still in bed-hehe
Deadgeckoo,"London, UK",Oct 2014,"The benefit of Double Six beach is that there are some rather nice beach bars along the stretch that give parts a nice boho vibe.  The beach itself isn't that nice - though if you're willing to shell out for drinks you can usually nab a sunbed or beanbag.  Ok, for swimming if it isn't too windy."
Sandra M,15 contributions,Sep 2015,"My husband and I have been coming here for a few years now and everytime we leave with a smile.From the beautiful ladies selling their wares to the abundant eateries.The atmosphere is like a village and everyone is welcomed with a smile and good conversation.The women are who make it for me.They have big smiles and bigger hearts and no matter how long between visits,they remember you and share a laugh.The waves are perfect for beginners,facillities are everywhere.Nothing is too much trouble for the hard working locals who give this area its soul.Fantastic community if you take the time to watch,listen and enjoy."
Nusye,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"Easy to access and beautiful sunset to enjoy serounding with cafe, restaurants, and hotels.. Lots of things this beach could be offer to the tourist"
jokeclaesen,"Kortessem, Belgium",Sep 2015,"Double Six beach was really quiet in september and we had some chairs from our hotel, so no complains here!"
adechan2015,Makassar,Aug 2015,"Nice beach with many place for chilling like La Plancha, etc. Oh well, one of the best spot to see sunset in Bali! You'll love it :)"
SweetbixNZ,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Sep 2015,"Slick place to go in the afternoon.  Lay on some bean bags and enjoy the sunset whilst getting drinks and food.  So good.  Then later as the night goes down, just spin some good yarns, meet people then go back to where for Netflix and chill."
dmcallis73,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2015,"Nice spot, also bars and restaurants around, nice relaxed place. Chairs available, normally you need to pay or be at one of the bars. "
Changchunlaowai,"Tongren, China",Sep 2015,"Convenient spot to meet friends and relax, but better beaches elsewhere. Easy to get a beer and chill out. Some surf was OK."
DithaXie,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Average beach, not for swimming nor enjoying the water. But best for evening walk to enjoy the sunset, you can see peoples plyaying football, running, or just playing the sand"
ketutdamar,"Ubud, Indonesia",Jul 2015,nice beach visit during sunset time . many place for chill out . good food and drink. some balinese women try to sell small thing . good spot for learn to surf.
bj582015,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,bright lights at night and lots of choice for food and lots of fine western style  music... beach sellers can be a problem in the day..... close to lots of restaurants but also food on the beach is 
Chris S,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2015,"Best place in Bali for sundowners, find a bean bag, plonk yourself down, order a drink, and drink in the atmosphere at sunset....."
Sunflower,United Kingdom,Jul 2015,"Great surfing beach, especially with Santai Surf school. Beach umbrellas and loungers are available for hire. Lovely sunsets"
MsGoriH,"Nottingham, UK",Aug 2015,"Chill out on beach at sunset, the bars put bean bags out, great atmosphere, live music, cocktails, fresh local food"
HyLy,"Singapore, Singapore",Sep 2015,The Sunset The Love The Companions The Food The Play The Wave The Friendly People...The Memories will stay...We will go back there to play again...❤
keshia w,9 contributions,Sep 2015,"Went there every morning for 3 days to play in the waves, get a tan and body board. The beach is dotted with colourful beach chairs and umbrellas that can be 'rented'. You just need to order a drink or two. My boyfriend and I ordered a coke and a bintang beer for SGD14 (pretty extravagant but we took it as rental for the chairs) and that entitled us to use their chairs for the whole day. We also rented 2 body boards for SGD10 for whole day use. Double six beach was away from the busy Kuta area, but can still get pretty crowded on the weekend. The waves here can get quite big and the under current can also get quite strong. Would suggest that parents keep their children close and in sight at all times. There were some points where I almost fell due to the strong under current. There were peddlers approaching us to purchase things from them, but once you say no they won't bother you so much. Or you could also close your eyes and pretend to sleep when you see them approaching your direction. All in all, this is a great place to rest, relax, people watch and learn surfing if you're up for it. It costs about SGD30 for 1.5 hours lesson."
Nicole L,"Mascot, Australia",Sep 2015,"Great spot to sit on the beach at one of the many bars and take in the beautiful sunsets.   Choose any bar, they are all pretty much similar.  Can get busy at sunset as its a popular spot.  "
Jadex3,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"Not much beach activities except for surfing. Just relax and chill on the lounge, grab some drinks and do people watching and watch the sunset (if it's not cloudy) "
Jamboash,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2015,"Great place to relax on the sun chairs, be prepared for people trying to sell you stuff but you can get a manicure on the beach for a great price! You can also rent surfboards by the hour for a good price. "
Robert A,6 contributions,Sep 2015,"pros : huge landscaped beach, a lot of food choice from cafes to warong, affordable price of food, cons : a lot of dogs sometimes can be intimidating"
Dewa W,5 contributions,Sep 2015,"There's another place to make your sunset time awesome..How's beautiful place,, how's beautiful sunset..Thank you for keep this place.."
Paul F,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"Great location, beautiful sunset.  bean bags on the beach.  friendly wait staff bringing you cocktails and beers (plus food if you want) on the beach.  very relaxing."
dwt991,"Brisbane, Australia",Sep 2015,"Great spot to sit and have a few bintangs and watch the sunset... Plenty of seats and umbrellas where you can get a drink and some bakso... In the evening try the dragon eggs sold by some of the hawkers on the beach, fantastic.."
Kelly M,18 contributions,Mar 2015,We had a lovely view from not only our room but our favourite bar. Prime location and not too busy.  Great place to spend a day and enjoy the sourounds.
monalitar,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Sep 2015,"I'll tell you what, during my 6 days in Bali, I visit this beach 3 times. Twice for sunset and once for surfing (I am a total newbie anyway)The beach is very near from the city, and there are so many shops on your way here, for those who love window shopping (or shopping) it's like a paradise. I told you.For sunset, there are so many restaurants and bar all along the beach which offer you table on the beach with beanbag to just chill, awaiting sunset. And the food, I consider them cheap. Some of them have live music too.I learnt how to surf here for the first time too. There are so many stall that offer surf learning, and it's bloody fun!"
LukenAsh,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2015,"no matter were you stay in Bali you should try going to double six beach and go to one of the bean bag bars or just enjoy to water and sunsets.if you jump in a taxi and a say double six beach and they will drop you at the end of the street and walk to the beach, lots of restaurants and bars to chose from and nice clean beach to swim or just sit and relax"
DanandPao,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2015,"Great beach, you can learn to surf, they have many sun chairs, some cheaper than others, they have many beach and restaurants on the beach, great for spending the day tanning, drinking coconuts or cocktails or spending  sunset with live music, close to shops, good for surf or swim. "
Phil H,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2015,Very clean and safe and was nice to walk further up the beach to Potato Head or down to Legian and Kuta. Cheap bars to sit under shade and enjoy a drink or two
TLCWorldtraveler,california,Aug 2015,Awesome hotel !! Thanks for the upgrade ! Gee the Manager was the nicest !! We will be back for sure.
Elizabeth M,147 contributions,Aug 2015,Awesome for lounging on the sand or in a nice chair. Be sure to post up next to a chair guy with beverages those are the best guys to make friends with. They typically can also rent you a board and you can barter with them for a better deal. Sunsets our here are also spectacular. Double six is a great fun day in the sand!
Pamela M,"North Haven, Australia",Aug 2015,"top spot on the beach at Seminyak, food excellent, view fantastic. Would recommend for sunset. We caught the golf cart from the Marriot down to the beach which was great"
SUE M,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"This is one of the most amazing Hotels I have seen, just beautiful treat you like  royalty, Rooms are amzing Restaurant and Roof Top Bar great and the Plantation Grill fabulous"
Tina G,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,"had lunch at the Italian restaurant, great menu and great food. Good service. Upstairs with a view of the beach and pool downstairs."
ThomasF,556 contributions,Aug 2015,"When we came the first day beach bed guys riped us off, and tried also the second day but then inknew what tonpay, they are to greedy and rud, and try to get max out you isnsted of wnating a returning client,Somhqlf price the second time, and intalkes with other clients and they also got this treatment.Found a big pice off glass in the sand just beside my bed.And a hassel all day by beach vendors, if you sleep they just pull a toe or scream in your ear to wake you up...way to much and the food placesnearby i just avarge and costly.Better go tona beach club and take a bed and buy food for the same price and get the sun bed for free"
adam,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,A lot of places to pull up and relax and watch the sunset beach is okay and quite crowded but that's why you go.
Jessica S,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,Great beach with loads of drinking and eating options on the sand. La Plancha seems like the best option with it's funky tunes and colourful beanbags but if you can't get a seat there then try any one of the lookalikes nearby. Lots of friendly beach vendors to haggle and giggle with. Double thumbs up for double six beach.
Diny T,"Dandenong, Australia",Aug 2015,Plenty of room for everyone and surf patrolled areas. Your not bothered too much by hawkers. Seems to be a safe beach to rest and play.
Naga Mas,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Had not been here for a Few years and was surprized how things change. Wel it all does, having been here in the Hippy days in the seventies...yea its different. Went from a dirt road to the beach to a full blown resort atmosphere area.         It was well known then and its well known now, gone are the little street warungs and replaced but excelent restos and also cute warungs still. Just come and explore and go see the graet sunset from here. Good place for Family friends and kids. Just as cozy place..."
linellsm,"Adelaide, Australia",Aug 2015,"good walking, but the beach could be kept cleaner.  effluent flowing over the beach to the sea is a bit confrontingl"
VonDutch1978,"Auckland Central, New Zealand",Aug 2015,"For me its a bit of a cliche now. Its nice to go down at sunset and have a beer, but there are nicer beaches in Bali."
Nipun_Parikh,"Ahmedabad, India",Aug 2015,A very clean beach and the sunset is just perfect. Has quiet a few nice restaurants who have live music on weekends and has good waves for surfing.  There are plenty of guys renting surf boards and ready to teach you too.  Do your bit of bargaining.
ambieis,"Gold Coast, Australia",Sep 2014,"This is my favourite chill spot... Have a Smirnoff or Bintang at Frank's Bar (on the beach outside Jayakarta), watch the sun set and listen to the boys play the guitar and bongo's. The beach can be super crowded and you will definitely be hassled to buy things."
tony532015,"Bunbury, Australia",Jul 2015,"Fine dining in nice location, opposite the beach the water is only a stone's throw from the restaurant. Wonderful food at affordable prices "
mylovelybie_1316,"Seven Mile Beach, Grand Cayman",Aug 2015,a nice place to relax and get your skin dark. many place along the beach if you want to hire a long chair. and also if you want your hair to be done like bob marley:) many restaurant around too.. lunch or dinner will be perfect while you enjoy the brezzee of the sea
Ayu_wida,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2015,Love to relax on the beach while enjoying the street meat ball soup and hang out with friends. Stunning sunset would complete your day
Michael C,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2015,Fabulous to watch the sunset from Bar or lounge on the beach.Sitting listening to the music and watch the sun go down is surreal.
edwardorusfid,"Jakarta, Indonesia",May 2015,its one of a great beach in the same line with kuta beach. but its more better than because its more private. several cafe around with live music and its cool. this beach is one of option beside kuta beach in bali
babybushka,30 contributions,Aug 2015,"Great beach, loads of small stalls selling ice cold drinks and food, lot's of people selling goods which can be a hassle at times, water was pretty clean and some nice surfing as well."
gloria f,"Mandurah, Australia",May 2015,"Great hotel ,just perfect including the staff and position.Only one problem is the very noisy club next door which is owned by the same hotel.Make sure that you book a room on the other side of this night club."
Borneo-Bob,"Hernhill, UK",Aug 2015,"We always come here to enjoy the sun and sea. The beach boys are great, very friendly and look after you throughout the day. A sunbed will cost you 50,000IDR (£2.50) for the day and is great value. Once you get used to the various beach sellers offering watches, sunglasses, sarongs, massage etc etc its fine. Most of them are very friendly and won't pester you if you politely say ""no thank you"". The fresh  fruit and ice cream sellers are definitely a hit though."
Ben A,"Hong Kong, China",Feb 2015,Attached to the hotel - the beach is beautiful and you can see a wonderful sunset. For hotel guests only and you can order from the bar/restaurant - a must for those seeking luxury!
SteveFawley,"Seal Beach, CA",Sep 2014,Double Six is a iconic beach in Bali. There is so much to see. Lots of good people watching. The beach can get a bit dirty with plastic trash. There are lots of street and beach sellers which get a bit bothersome and they do not take no for a answer. Double Six is a great place to go grab a beer and watch the sunset.
MICHAELJC59,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,"Such an iconic place to laze , swim eat and people watch . We spent 5 different days here .. you can barter for beach loungers for the day but never pay more than 50k for the day per chair  "
Travellor,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2015,Lots to see and do. Be prepared for hawkers selling stuff on the beach. Lots of places to eat and relax.
Geeess,"Rome, Italy",Sep 2014,There are many beaches in Bali and its best to go to one close to you to avoid traffic. This ones a great area if you stay in Seminyak and Legian as its close to both and motorbikes can you get there quickly. They are very crowded but have nice eating places and views as well.
chis2014,"Napier, New Zealand",Aug 2015,Water was lovely renting a chair with umbrella is a great idea watch out for the Hawkes they are everywhere
jo-lee j,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,Went to the roof top bar for after dinner drinks. One of the best settings in Seminyak. Staff all lovely. decor amazing. A beautiful place.
Sebastian K,"Vienna, Austria",Aug 2015,I think the beach is not only very nice but very good to start Surfing. As I think that all Schools more or less are able to teach I Chose one and had much fun.
AyuSavitri,"Guangzhou, Guangdong, China",May 2015,perfect sunset view! love it with beers we went almost everyday watching sunset from here. La Planca is my fav place 
Joy,Mauritius,Jul 2015,"A lovely big beach which has the typical characteristics of  a busy beach. On arriving it is very littered near all the vendors. Loungers are available from IDR 20 000 to IDR 50 000 depending on the season and your bargaining ability. There are a lot of surf schools and good beach to learn to surf. You can have a pedicure, massage or hair plaited by one of the ladies who come around. "
redbeachsuz,"Orewa, New Zealand",Jul 2015,"Seminyak is my most favourite beach in this area.  Especially at Sunset, with a Bintang in a Bean Bag.  Bliss"
Ian J,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,"Fantastic place to spend an afternoon and watch the sun go down. Good music, good food and cold beers....awesome."
IndianinSingaland,Singapore,Jun 2015,"unlike other beaches at Kuta or Seminyak, which are overflowing with rowdy crowds and activity, this one is a calm, laid back, soft sand beach. perfect for couples wanting to soak in the magic."
Otis Noble,"Brisbane, Australia",Jul 2015,Beautiful beach that isnt quite as busy as Kuta which is a pleasant change. Still a few people barking at you to buy things but overall a beautiful sunset and lovely temperature water to walk through. 
karen201520152015,"Al Khobar, Saudi Arabia",Jul 2015,"Liked :- Good for surfing, Disliked :- Current to strong to swim in & beach touts don't leave you alone & get really annoying! "
alexandre_delasalle,"Paris, France",Jul 2015,"bali is a paradise on earth...or could be...!( and i ve been around more than 50 country in my life,)  i remenber some freind show me picture from long time beofre the first time i came to bali in the early 80' a stuning paradise this beach was., it's been a disaster since then...! the all dirty water of 1000' of hotel and restaurant from kuta to legian go directly to the beach water... it's insane!  who really want to swim in his own poo...??? i wonder why the baliness as a comunity don't take serious mesure to keep bali clean (i mean like just the minimum) please it's never too late, do something!"
Carol250342,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,"Wow ! Wow ! Wow ! Amazing , different decor. Fabulous service. Incredible food !!! Brilliant pool !!! Loved everything. Don't miss the Sensorial spa experience !"
Sjalina,"Bali, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Although its more crowded than the eastern part of Bali, but its still a more convenient beach for regular beachgoers. Still a good spot to watch the sunset along the strip."
nellielim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Sep 2014,"This is the 'happening' beach of this island. Great for watching sunsets while enjoying an evening out. With the number of bars, restaurants and clubs here, the evening will be a lively one. In the daytime, you can enjoy the beach in peace on a deck chair or go horse back riding, learn to surf or join in some beach activity."
Colin616,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2015,"Our hotel was just across from this beach it is great for families with a wide expanse of sand which is kept clean each morning there is a beach patrol with flags denoting safe areas to swim in the surf , there are a number of beach cafes and small bars along the beach at night the beach comes alive with live bands and you can relax on the bean bags provided and enjoy the music, great fun."
Bryan R,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jul 2015,I recently stayed at a hotel close to the beach and went to the beach each day.The beach had swimming flags which a lot of swimmers swan between.The problem was that lots of surfers also kept moving into the area making it very unsafe for the swimmers due to the surf boards frequently nearly hitting the swimmers.After seeing many near misses I approached the surf life savers they said the current was pulling the surfers along the beach so there is nothing they could do. I pointed out that the flags are there for swimmer safety and the surfers should not be in the area under any circumstances and besides they had all of the rest of the beach to surf. The life savers answer was to remove the swimming flags and put up no swimming signs - not a satisfactory outcome.  For the rest of my stay (9 days) the flags were not put back out. It seems that the surfers have all the rights and to bad for swimmers.I love the Bali beaches its just a pity safety isn't taken a little more seriously but I suppose that's Bali for you.
jdb339,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,Much better beach than Kuta. Was clean and not that many hawkers. Great place to kick back and have a few Bitangs and grab some food. Nice sunset's also
Chris F,"Warragul, Australia",May 2015,Loved the waves either for just watching or for catching. The water was walk in warm.The only drawback is that the beach is not as clean as the beaches in Australia. They do sweep the beach in the morning with a tractor but following behind there is still a lot of rubbish left. The colour of the sand is quite dark.
1954Elizabeth,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2015,"Seminyak beach is very clean at the moment,  We are here in July 2015. Seminyak beach is a lovely long beach to walk along. There is always plenty happening from local soccer games, kite flying, horse riding, surfing and plenty of music. There are lots of beach restaurants and bars to choose from."
richardkesper,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,We found that this side of the beach is cleaner than Legian or Kuta...Lots less rubbish and lots less hawkers... The gay area is great for a bintang too !!!!
Annika C,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Jun 2015,This time we had no rain so the beach and water was beautiful and clean.  The water temperature was a bit cool.
MelS64,"Echuca, Australia",Jun 2015,Beautiful beach with comfortable chairs and umbrella to hire. Loved having a cocktails st sunset after a day sunbathing and then finishing up with dinner in one of the quaint little restaurants right on the beach.
Lel1Perth,Perth,Jul 2015,"A great night out and excellent value with its 2 for 1 drinks offer every Tuesday. The drinks are accompanied by some very good jazz from a live band who play from 7pm to 10pm. We ordered food including sate,vietnamese spring rolls to share and every dish was good. It's was luxury at an affordable price. "
2015megs2015,"Adelaide, Australia",Jun 2015,"we are a family of 3, and it cost approx $13 AUD to hire 3 sun lounges and an umbrella for a day.  The young guys set it all up for you and keep an eye on your belongings.  As with any of the beaches in Bali, you get people coming up to you all the time offering shorts, sunglasses, manicures, massages etc.  We were there during bali school holidays, so the balinese kids are being dragged around all day by their mums, hoping that you feel sorry for the kids and buy stuff from them.  The sunsets are great.  You can hire surf boards and boogie boards and do surfing lessons as well. The surf is usually pretty good.  There are plenty of restaurants around for lunch or dinner. "
FROMManny,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,This is a new hotel and rooftop wine-bar with incredible design with  great cocktail and food options. Sip a cocktail with a view and watch the waves rolling in over Seminyak in style.
Rebecca B,"Broome, Australia",Jan 2015,Great cafes along the beach with bean bags out the front. Could easily spend a whole afternoon chilling out! 
Ramadhan Harya,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"This place is rather good in sunset time, live music, restaurant to chill for sunset is very good, i can stay until midnight sitting near beach, looking at stars and hear live music. In the day, this place is not that good, rather dirty :/ "
Nev B,Elanora,May 2015,"we love going to the beach, hiring some lounges ( Andy Bar),sitting watching the world walk by, conversing with the vendors ,we are getting to be regulars , so no real hard sell...eating fruit, reading, having a Bintang, local food from the beach......overall, just relaxing "
Ginanjarr,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Jul 2015,"Nice beach, we can use the sun bed without renting it (not like any other beach). The waves is good for surfing and there's a lot of restaurants to pick if you're hungry. Would give more stars if it's easy to find toilet and car parking lot."
BSWAustralia,"Tweed Heads, Australia",Jul 2015,This a great beach for learning to surf (lots of surf schools here). The beach has darker silica in the sand so it has a black tinge but it's really fine and soft. The water is clear and appeared clean without refuse or pollution. Importantly the beach is patrolled with uniformed competent lifeguards and no savage rip or undertow that we could see or feel so a good kids beach. Lots of deck chairs for rent if that's your thing and no hassles from hawkers with friendly locals all around. Located at the end of double six street.
Kristy L,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2015,"Nice beach spot, very popular! Great restaurants along the beach. Sun beds and umbrellas cheap to rent ($5 AUD) for as long as you want. Sand is black. Beach has a bit of rubbish from people but I've seen balinese trying to clean it, not bad though. "
RizaL Sulaeman,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jun 2015,One spot in bali to have a sun tan and also have a little message on the beach. Meanwhile others surfing for the boys who enjoy surfing or just simple lying on the beach to have a sun tan.
noviam s,Indonesia,Jul 2015,nice.i enjoyed an fun. Very nice spot for drinks..watched the sunset in a cabana. The beach is clean.
The-Swain,"Dandenong, Australia",Jun 2015,It was right across the road from the hotel. Good waves for trainee surfers. There were lounges for hire and plenty of room. very popular with locals and holiday makers
John Le Raye,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Jun 2015,"A must do. Watch the sunset, then lines of planes coming in to land at Denpassar. In the distance fishing boats after a nights catch. not the cleanest of beaches, swim back at your Villa instead."
Billyhatescustard,"Newport, UK",Apr 2015,"gorgeous beach, you can even shop from your sunbed, and the sellers are friendly and will go away if you don't want to by anything. You can learn to surf, our friend did and loved it, I even had ""a go"" but not standing up!!!! Getting on it was hard enough. The sun is hot, the sea is clear and warm, and the sand is absolutely boiling so ear your flip flops down to the wet sand  or run as fast as you can. Stay under cover for your first couple of days if you are a brit- the sun burns quickly. "
Peter G,"Pacific Coast Australia, Australia",Jun 2015,"a good vibe.  the beach had an interesting mix of beach goers, restaurant patrons and kite sellers.  The beach was active all day and the sunsets were not to be missed"
Rachel L,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"Nice and great place to hang out and have a walk on the beach. Can get crowded but it still has a great vibe. At sundown, head to La Plancha for some great 90's music mix and relax on the colourful bean bags and brollies with cocktails and nibbles."
Stephen O,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"Apart from the amazing view of a magnificent beach this area has a bunch of restaurants and other activities that will help you enjoy your day.   We especially liked finishing up there at the end of the day, falling into a bean bag and watching the sun go down whist we sipped on a cocktail or two.   Wonderful spot to unwind and relax."
girleen,"Portland, OR",Jun 2015,"Bali beaches still need some clean up, but this is an excellent beach to learn how to surf. Mornings are best. The waves are strong - you hardly have to paddle to catch one. I'm a novice surfer and it's one of our favorite beaches."
Bali2u0812,"Bali, Indonesia",Jun 2015,"We met up with friends for sunset drinks on the beach and it was a great atmosphere with plastic chairs, umbrellas and the chilled alcohol in the eskies!"

geoo1,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,"Most enjoyable evening with friends.  Food was very good, music was fun, sunset was great as usual.  Very nice spot for dinner and drinks, will certainly go back."
Missslizz,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,This place is incredible!!!! Must book a dinner on the rooftop in the booths! Food amazing! min spend $100 but very easy to do with a big group! Worth going!!!!!! you will see when you get there :)
Quinn E,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2015,"being hassled too much by hawkers while trying to eat. La Paloma is the best on the strip, read menus well before going in "
T1NT1N,"Bondi Junction, Australia",Jun 2015,Stayed at the double six hotel beach and cafes were good sand is a little darker than other areas waves good and some flagged swimming areas along beach
Puku75,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,Very unusual and awesome venue. Loved this place. Watched the sunset in a cabana. No singlets for boys but you can buy at t-shirt for A$10 if you forget! Make sure you're there for sunset. Well worth it.
piku1980,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable."
BeachLoverNN,Singapore,Jun 2015,Everyone must go to Seminyak Beach for the most widest beach and chill-out experience.You don't have to go the expensive beach clubs to enjoy the beaches of Seminyak. Prices are reasonable.Go at 5pm is the best time to wait for the sun to set. Seminyak beach is the best experience of watching the world go by with a drink or two in hand together with loved ones.
shazmann2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2015,"Dirty grey sand makes it visually unappealing and some places along the beach are littered with rubbish. However, the water itself is lovely and it is a perfect learner surfer beach (at least it was when we were there)."
Mimi P,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"the beach is clean, very nice sandy beach, big waves, not too crowded. you can enjoy to just walk around the beach or swimming. Also lots restaurant surrounding the beach. During sunset it very beautiful."
Lorelle L,"Korumburra, Australia",Jun 2015,"Waves at the time where bigger than what I thought they would be, not a beach for a non confident swimmer. Lots of activities going on like, fireworks, hirers of equipment, deck lounges for hire, hawkers trying to sell you stuff. Nice view "
Clive G,"Perth, Australia",Jun 2015,"Double Six Beach is located between Legian and Seminyak. I guess about a kilometre strip of beach. During the day it is the same as any other beach but toward sunset and into the evening the place begins to buzz. There are numerous bars along the beach each offering some sort of seating, food and drinks and live music. All at inflated prices with plus plus to cap off the price. BUT if you go you are there for a sunset and balmy evening on the beach. Best advice I can give is to monitor your bill as it can too easy get out of hand. Food is at best ordinary.  If you choose to swim be aware there are quite large waves (Dumpers) which form in very shallow water. Be aware of the rips that form quickly and the odd idiot on a surf board out of control. For all that a very pleasant evening can be had here if you are carefull."
DocDanG,"Berlin, Germany",Jun 2015,During daytime it is like any other beach. But for sunset the bars but out nice chairs to enjoy a dirnk or two ;) listening to live music.
Jess K,"Nagambie, Australia",Jun 2015,"Fantastic place to spend an afternoon or sunset. Relax on a day bed for a very small price if you negotiate, have fresh coconuts and beers brought over to you, get a massage and a pedicure whilst working on your tan with friends, what more could you ask for!"
Melissa C,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Jun 2015,"This hotel surpassed all expectations. The staff were wonderful, very helpful & their uniforms were very nice. Our room was exceptional, really really nice. The shower was powerful enough to wash my hair (not too common in Bali) and the accessories (Hermes) and mini bar were very impressive. The in house Restaurants were all great and the spa was wonderful. I cant recommend this hotel highly enough."
Brooke C,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2015,Double Six is much cleaner and quieter than Seminyak Beach. You can easily spend the day there sunbaking and swimming without being hassled every five minutes. If you fancy having a go at surfing there are lots of cool people there more than happy to show you the ropes. Overall great beach only five minutes away from Seminyak. 
Kristi E,"Northern Territory, Australia",Jun 2015,"Excellent view, great service, very classy. Food was lovely. Cocktail was one of the best I had in Seminyak. Seating and tables were great for large groups or couples"
Rahuli786,"Rohtak, India",Jun 2015,"lots of local restaurants around,lot of surfing activities,visited around 8 beaches in bali found it to be best beach ,Highly recommended."
Ali B,"Joondalup, Australia",May 2015,This place is suited for couples or groups with table service provided for all drinks and food. Tapas was good and staff really helpful and friendly. Not the cheapest place but if you time it for happy hour it helps! A good night out and great view of the beach and sunset from some of the booths.
mmhsydney,sydney,Jun 2015,"Loved watching the waves and the surfers all looking for that great wave.heaps of bars along the beach where you can buy drinks and cheap food. Sand is very black and not nice to sit on without a deck chair, which can be hired for a reasonable rate"
snake43,"Victoria, Australia",May 2015,"Fantastic beach for sunset and dinner and just to relax, many restaurants on the beach and awesome music to listen to. Arrive about 5.30pm for sunset, pick a beach restaurant to sit at, jump on a bean bag, relax and enjoy the sunset and just take everything in while you are being waitered on by the friendly staff.  Most beach bar's have live music about 8pm, We felt safe to sit their till about midnight, much safer than kuta beach at night. It's about $5.00 in a taxi from Kuta or $3.00 from Legian, just ask to be taken to double 6 beach, they will drop you off at the end of the road near the cocoon club just walk across to the beach....Pure magic"
LizT55,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,"Nice to look at at the different times of day and tides. Dig dumping waves often. Someone drowned one night when we were there.Black sand, very clingy. Tractors drive around each morning. And people ride horses - watch out!  Not a good beach. "
Daniel P,"Seoul, South Korea",May 2015,"Just like any other beaches around this area, the waves are quite high thus making it suitable for boogie boards and surfers. Fortunately it is cleaner in general compared to Kuta Beach where at times it can be filthy from the trashes of the tourists.I think it will be a great place to hang out if you have time to spare!"
Liachaterina,8 contributions,May 2015,"just 5 mins walk from seminyak area, jogging-friendly, and nice sunset! crowd is good, many restaurant offer food and beverage to enhance ur sunset experience."
NatB1,79 contributions,May 2015,cleaner than most beaches in Bali and close to the new double 6 hotel which has great dining and nightlife
Emma B,"Perth Hills, Australia",Jan 2015,"Of course we are spoilt for beaches in Australia, we can't compare. But the fun, cheap massages and surfing lessons is great! Still love it, great atmosphere that can't be beaten anywhere."
stephen w,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Excellent food, good wine and to top it off, free bar snacks during happy hour.  The bar on the 4th floor is over rated and tries too hard to be hip.  Go to the W or the bar at Ayana if you really want a treat.Overall"
Lourose73,"Perth, Australia",May 2015,"Love the fact you can lounge on a beanbag, order food and drinks, and just watch the sun go down listening to live music. Just superb. The hawkers trying to sell their wares can become annoying, but if you are firm and friendly with your ""no"", they will leave you alone"
Ian B,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2015,Beach dining was excellent and it was just amazing to walk along such a clean beach especially at sunset.
Essy G,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,This is one of my favourite beach as it very relaxed and has all the cafes with the outdoor bean bags during the evening. During the day there is day beds you can hire from many places as well as the small beach bars that sell drinks. You still get every one comign up to try and sell you anything from sunnies to ice cream but its not as full on as kuta beach.
Enlightenedlyn,"Torquay, Australia",Apr 2015,Beach had a lot of rubbish and smell there was an outlet from the street. I would not recommend swimming there.
VirginiaRoss,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,I walk down in the early morning and while this might look ok at night it's just very ordinary in the daylight. I hate nothing more in Bali than seeing signs for COLD PISS. Don't bother
Sandy B,Melbourne,May 2015,"Just great have a beer, enjoy something to eat whilst relaxing in a bean bag, listening to live music and just loving life Fantastic loved it"
Puzzo P,21 contributions,Feb 2015,"The sand is not white, but very long and wide with beautiful waves and spectacular sunset I forget the color right away. "
fudgie55,"Rockingham, Australia",May 2015,"One of the best places in the area of Seminyak a must see and experience . We have just returned and held my husbands 50th Birthday on the Rooftop bar we had a group of 20 and all our guest were impressed with not only the venue the sunset and the staff all out done themselves we booked our table from 3pm -8pm then we moved on to the VIP room one level down from the rooftop again a showcase presented room our Erving kicked on to the early hours thank you Double Six I will definitely be returning. On this holiday to Bali I visited Double Six 3X that's how much I love the venue the selection of restaurants, bars, and the whole ambience is just amazing.. A must visit travellers 👍"
gitzgitz,"Denpasar, Indonesia",May 2015,"If you feel lazy to go to another beach near Uluwatu to catch the sunset, then this beach is okay too. A lot of beach bar. You can swim a little also if the wave is not too big."
Courtney J,"Sydney, Australia",May 2015,"Grab a beanbag chair and watch a stunning sunset. As the sun goes down, most of the bars have live music on the beach. Drinks are well-priced - we found for as low as about $2.50 beer. Lots of options for food along the strip."
Leisure93,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Apr 2015,Compared to Kuta this beach is better for a swim and surfing. Much more cleaner than Kuta beach. We enjoyed the beach.
Gerald2463,"Mangalore, India",Apr 2015,Nice beach with grey sand and blue water. Lots of food joints. Better than Kuta beach. Good place to relax have a massage on the beach while sipping on Bintang or Cocktails.
Sarah41KL,Malaysia,Apr 2015,This beach is cleaner and quieter than Kuta beach. Sand very refine and smooth but big waves when we went so we could not swim. This is also good place for surfers. Recommendable.
miztraver,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,Very dirty beach. There are also a few sewer outlets running into ocean. Would never use it. Rubish strewn all over the sand. Black sand.
hendrikh413,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2015,"Double six beach is located in Seminyak area ( Jl. Double Six ), not too far from Kuta and Legian. The beach is more interesting than Kuta Beach. Have lot of food shop and cafe nearest from The beach."
Melissa S,"Mackay, Australia",Apr 2015,Great waves for learning to surf as well as the avid surfer. The sand isn't as white as that at home in Oz but that is to be expected in a volcanos area. Plenty of cafes along the beachfront also. 
Steve c,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2015,Lovely large beach but grey sand.I didn't think water was as clean as could be.If going to the beach and just sun baking all day is your thing then maybe its great. 
Charlie X,NSW,Apr 2015,The Italian is worth a visit the food is the best italian I've been to around the world.Also make a point to visit the roof top the view and finger food is awesome.Tuesday & Thursday nights 2 for 1. Our next visit in Jan 2016 we will be staying here after inspecting the rooms.
Carmen L,"South Australia, Australia",Apr 2015,"Clean, I was expecting to see a lot of rubbish along the beach in the morning as per pics on the net but a tractor comes every morning (you can't even hear it) to clean anything on the beach."
Bronwyn B,Brisbane,Apr 2015,"By far the best beach in the Kuta, Legian,Seminyak region. Chairs are cheap as are the Bintangs. Always easy to get to regardless of where you are staying."
338joyce,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2015,Not the best Bali beach. Sand black.  Rubbish in water but they do try to clean it.  No bins around to put your own rubbish in.
Simon_Carter77,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Apr 2015,It was okay. Liked the multitude of thrown together bars on the beach. Water was warm and not many hawkers at this part of the beach.
Sheena C,"Victoria, Canada",Apr 2015,"I hear it's mostly due to the time of year but the amount of garbage was disappointing. Unless you are directly in front of a nice resort, parts of the beach were filthy. Even then, standing in the waves, a plastic bag wrapped around my leg, and I certainly watched other human debris float by. Other travellers we spoke to had similar experiences. If you are travelling between December and May, I would definitely chose a different part of Bali for beaches. The waves look lovely, but its a different story close up. "
David S,5 contributions,Apr 2015,A beautiful beach once you run the gauntlet of enthusiastic beer and sunshade vendors.Great in the evenings for younger holidaymakers with live & recorded music in several places.Very popular with surfers. Lifeguards were on duty.The only thing that spoils it a little is the bogans who leave their rubbish on the beach. You carried it down there - carry it back!!!
weeflea,australia,Apr 2015,Music on the beach at bean bag bars! Great way to start your evening. Half of Melbourne and a lot of Bali will be there!  
lonevol,"Singapore, Singapore",Apr 2015,"Great music and items are well priced. Great place to watch sunset. Lots of folks coming and sell items, but they are friendly bunched. Would recommend to come here if you are feeling casual."
Jo B,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2015,Not the cleanest of beaches constant hassle from vendors but if you like that sort of thing then you will enjoy. Good for learning to surf.
Deb05213,"Kuta, Indonesia",Oct 2014,"Loved this new hotel at the end of Double 6.  Got a great package deal with Luxury Escapes and wished I had of purchased more.  Our room was divine, and the service and amenities were 6 stars.Loved the location and the swimming pool was amazing.  Restaurants in the complex were amazing and the food amazing."
Trinity S,"Island of Malta, Malta",Mar 2015,I'm not a surfer so maybe surfers would enjoy the waves but for people who just enjoy sunbathing on the sand and go for a paddle avoid this beach. It is just very dirty and unappealing.
Lisa210,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,Lovely to take a walk along the beach at sunset. Have a beer sitting on a coloured bean bag in one of the beachside restaurants.
Megan S,40 contributions,Mar 2015,"I quite liked Double Six Beach. It was a bit grubby with a bit of litter around etc but still a nice place to hang out, particularly at night. I hired an umbrella lounge for $5 and was soon approached by one of the many massage ladies who sell along the beach. They sell bracelets, sarongs, do manicures, massages, you name it, they do it. I had a great massage by a lovely older lady. She was very nice and it was a good massage. I paid about $13 Australian i guess which is probably more than the going rate for a beach massage, but i thought she was worth it. Bit annoying to have other ladies come and try to sell you things when you clearly have your eyes closed in the middle of a massage, i just tried to ignore them without being rude. Often they would go and get a little child to come back with them to see if that improved their sales tactics. If there was something i wanted to buy i would not have minded but how many sarongs and bracelets can you buy in bali??? This beach cafes etc were not really open during the lead up to Nyepi Day so we only got to go down there our last night. La Plancha was very popular with all the umbrellas and bean bags on the beach. We decided to go to the little place one up from them, i think it was called the Juice Park or something like that. Bean bags, not as busy and cheap drinks, we were very happy to hang out there and would certainly go back. Much quieter than La Plancha and we even had a foot massage on the bean bags, how cool is that. We stayed at the gorgeous Double Six Resort but next time would not waste my time drinking at their rooftop bar or their expensive pool area. At $16 for a very average cocktail i would rather drink cheap drinks on a bean bag on the beach any time. Especially with someone massaging my feet! Doesnt get any better than that in Bali! "
Nicole D,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,"A great beach with lots of little bars on it. Bean bags everywhere. Lots of balinese eager to sell there goods or a neck massage, pedicure, manicure while you enjoy a cold drink."
mick6068,27 contributions,Mar 2015,The best spot to sit on a beanbag and watch the sun go down.The peddlers were a bit too much but after a lot of saying no they finally got the message
radenayu,Bogor,Nov 2014,"You can enjoy sunsets on colorful beanbags, or take your dog here. One of the most well-known cafe at the area is La Plancha. On some nights you can also enjoy live music at several bars."
Washolovestotravel,"Adelaide, Australia",Mar 2015,Very disappointing.  I was told it was due to the recent tides but the amount of rubbish was incredible
JacJac2015,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2015,Private beach and surf was great.  Able to access the beach fast and also surf board are always avaliable
BaliBrian,"San Francisco, CA",Mar 2015,"Get an umbrella, relax and the beach boys will bring you cold drinks all day. My favourite restaurant the Zanzibar is across the street with terrific reasonably priced food (plus a toilet)..."
nevanov,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2014,"nature and party. that all you get. also there are many restaurant here. from local food to western. If you planned to enjoy sunset while drink some beers, double six will be the best place."
lynda k,"Sydney, Australia",Mar 2015,"Hotel fantastic, wonderful food and service 5*only negative is noise from outside nightclub and noisy air con "
trustascot,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,The hotel is brand new and very luxurious with fantastic balconies and one gigantic pool. It also has an bar on the beach with live music played every night.
Keggfish,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2015,"Back in Bali again we have been stunned by the amount of rubbish on the beaches on the Legian side of the island in the morning.  Whilst admittedly there were a couple of storms last week, the amount of rubbish washing up on the beaches should be making us all terrified about the state of the planet.  We al went fishing from Benoa and the teIl of rubbish extending miles out towards Nusa Lembongan was horrifying.  Our 15 year old grandson was most upset and it really made an impact on him.  The authorities do clean the beaches but they need more equipment and the rubbish needs to be removed.  However leaving the above aside, the beach has a good atmosphere and there are It's of little spots to sit and have a cold drink, rent a lounge, umbrella and some great little beach shacks serving great cheap food and cold drinks.  The beaches are not a patch on those we have in Western Australia, nor the water quality, but unfortunately we appear to have an unbelievable aversion to allowing people to build small restaurants, cafes and the like to service those whom wish to use the beaches, something the wonderful Balinese do not."
Drexy C,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2015,"the beach is quiet and peace, but unfortunatelly sometimes the beach become dirty when the sunset time, because the visitors sometimes tossed the garbage everywhere"
kenrick w,"Port Macquarie, Australia",Feb 2015,"more for surfing and the contact game,not really good for swimming.the dining along this beach are great. Zanzibar is great for elevated sunset drinks."
Pat B,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,"Nice beach, lots of people and kites and waves. Sun beds for rent and many cool drinks available for the thirsty traveller"
Hebbie,"Western Australia, Australia",Feb 2015,"The hawkers on the beach drove us nuts! Only went once as we went there for a peaceful swim! The hotel did take us there in their buggy, which was nice."
DebraJaneC,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,"Double six beach is a nice clean beach, good for walking etc.At night there are a few bars on the beach with bean bags to sit on which look great.The bars all have live music but I think they try and compete with each other so you can hear the music from the other bars as well so that I didn't like.Quite loud too.The sunsets are amazing so would still go."
denise H,"Toronto, Canada",Feb 2015,"When we were there the beach was clean, water was great! Lots of fun in the waved!Fun atmosphere, Lounge rentals $5, bintang $2.50 - some hawkers-have to kind of ignore...fantastic sunset!! Surf lessons available"
Muru_KL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Feb 2015,My family and I enjoyed to be at the Double Six Beach. It is clean. Enjoy the sunset in the evening. So beautiful! In the evening there is a live music and we sit enjoy the music.
Carol-Anne E,"Hobart, Australia",Feb 2015,"Recommended to us by previous visitors to Bali. After a walk along the beach our family dined here for lunch. Whilst it appeared to be the slow season, many diners were taking advantage of this popular venue. An up market expereince with a reasonable priced menu. Service was very good, did not wait for our food for very long. Indonesian and western foods available. I had the Pasta Carbonara, very delicious and made to order. The restaurant is part of a very large accomodation complex right near the beach, visitors enjoying the pool experience as we walked through to the restaurant. We will look to stay here next time we visit"
Pancakepie,Europe,Apr 2014,"The place in Bali i saw the most of street vendors and people trying to sell you something.I have never said ""No Thank You"" in one place more than i did in Double SixBut after 8 pm it gets bit quieter and pretty chill actually. Cocktails are good (especially the ones served inside of a coconut - sometimes you have to tell them to serve your cocktail in a coconut and for extra 0.5 AUD thy will do it)But for my taste (when i was there while the sun was still up) double six is not a nice place to have a chilled drink with your misses. Extremely touristic and allot of people under 20 away from home who had more drinks that they could actually handleTake a scooter and some time and go to Balian beach instead. Cheers"
CDN_GUY_40,"Raleigh, NC",Feb 2015,"The beach has dark sand and very popular with locals and tourists. It was a great place to relax and work on your tan. There are many plsces to rent chairs, order food and drinks.Local ladies will come and offer spa services right at your chair. Not as busy as Kuta Beach but just as nice!"
Dianne980,"Evans Head, Australia",Feb 2015,"The beach is a great position , the food is good,  drinks are cold and a little shopping while there."
Roni G,"Darwin, Australia",Feb 2015,"Double Six Beach is the last part of the good beaches between Kuta and Seminyak. The further you go towards Seminyak from hear the beaches are crap. This beach still has all that the Legian beach has to offer but a bit more secluded. There are restaurants on offer with the usual coloured bean bags on offer, it has a trendy party feel with different restaurants to choose from, some on the beach and some over the road behind the beach. Everything is close by...."
Colin B,"Sydney, Australia",Feb 2015,"My travel partner and I had opposing views about Double Six Beach. I had been disappointed by Seminyak beach just farther north of this one, whereas he had liked Seminyak's ambience. I liked Double Six's feel and nearby places, but he found them less desirable. Beaches are such a subjective thing, but I quite liked this one, as Bali's beaches in this area go. None of them were great compared with the beaches down to the south end, e.g. Nusa Dua."
FassoMark,"Melbourne, Australia",Feb 2015,"The beach is filthy the water smelled of sewerage after the rain!litter all over the beach from drains,"
Chrisinasia,Asia,Feb 2015,Nothing to compare with the old time 66 beach. Still comfy and a great place to watch the sunset. Bars now are quite pricey and vendors pushy...
Donna B,"Greater Perth, Australia",Feb 2015,Unfortunately the beach front in Seminyak is not that clean and the volcanic sand doesn't add much!  Great  to take a morning walk along though!
Robert G,"Adelaide, Australia",Feb 2015,"Each morning after breakfast, my wife and I took a walk on this lovely beach. Warm water, clean beach and great views!"
SamChopra,"New Delhi, India",Dec 2014,There are loads of restaurants and hotels by the side of this beach. Easily accessible. Better to take a cab. You will find many shacks on the beach also. The all serve alcohol. Its a busy beach.
Alan W,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2014,Lots of different Beach Restaurant's and at night many of these have live bands. Sitting on the beach at night on beanbags drinking cocktails and listening to live music.
James P,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Very clean near our hotel and hotel umbrellas for our use. Never too busy and close to cafes and restaurants 
Daninsydney2065,"Sydney, Australia",Jan 2015,"Good music, great views, awesome location. Amazing for the younger set, (music) but still very enjoyable"
Paula M,Figtree,Feb 2015,"This is a magical place to chill out on the beach as the sunsets. Grab a beanbag at any of the cafes along the beach, grab a drink and listen to the music. Watch all of the action as the sun sets. Bliss"
missscoward,"Wolverhampton, UK",Feb 2015,"Not the greatest beach I have been to, I understand the currant was bring a lot of litter onto the beach which was a shame."
Paul R,"Greater Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Sunsets were great and the music from the local cafes was always upbeat and modern. Nice to see people happy and enjoying themselves.
uktraveler2015,Singapore,Feb 2015,It had such warm water it was like walking in a bath. The only bad thing was the hassle from the beach vendors but once you'd said you didn't want anything a couple of times they left you alone.
Beach Bum B,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2015,"This is an extraordinary beach from Apr-Dec when the current runs west from Bali; flat, clean and welcoming.Mid Dec-March the current flows from Java and Sumatra towards Bali and the beach is loaded with anything and everything you can imagine; not a nice place to play.They try to clean it but seem to fail more than succeed!The west coast from the airport to Canggu is pretty much all the same at this time~~~Indonesia needs to work on Environmental awareness or tourists will stop coming during those months.Today, 4 Feb, the beach was a mess.Beach Bum Bill"
Nadia S,9 contributions,Jan 2015,"Compare to Kuta beach, this beach has one of the most beautiful sunset... I am sure will go back there..."
Genevieve A,59 contributions,Aug 2014,"Beach and surf great and restaurants very good especially ""Sea Side"" We got lounges and umbrellas on the beach very cheap and it was good they had the flags to swim between for safety. The beach is kept very clean and ""Ari"" looked after us each day with a good price for lounges. The Ice Cream boys were great on the beach especially ""Echo"" and Frankie."
BeatBop66,"Tiwi Islands, Australia",Jan 2015,"Amazing view on the balcony, sitting in the sunken lounges surrounded by water, over looking Legion Beach, sipping delicious cocktails. Sweet and attentive staff."
Sam9922,"Medellin, Colombia",Jan 2015,"Plenty of vendors trying to sell you things. Not so clean, Much better other beaches further towards Cangu"
Simon R,Glenside,Jan 2015,"We spent last visit at this beach and found it a refreshing change from Seminyak Beach. The beach vendors are very friendly, check out the candlit beach bag sing fest from around 7 everynight. Check it out on your next visit. "

Jane,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2015,"watched 2 awesome sunsets at this beach, clean and well maintained.  A relaxing way to spend the day or evening."
LagsFamily,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Jan 2015,"Some nice bars and cafes but spoilt by all the rubbish washed up on the beach. It was a shame to see so much human rubbish along the beach including syringes, plastic bags etc. Not a safe place for kids to play."
VTik,"Singapore, Singapore",Jan 2015,"Pro :- Nice beach with ocean view.  Good view for sunset.- Lots of cafe, restaurants and bars fronting the beachside.Con:- Extremely dirty beach during the monsoon season (Dec/Jan) when the rubbish from the rivers got washed to the beachside."
Lawrence H,"Brisbane, Australia",Jan 2015,"The amount of plastic , logs , bottles that was floating in the water was very bad and disappointing very very dirty. "
Dolphindream,"Byron Bay, Australia",Oct 2014,Just too many sellers on the Beach - not so Clean - but if your YOUNG and Looking for a DAY VIBE - lots of Day Beds on the Beach to meet others very Social - but I don't like the Vibes for Families with Kids - Too hectic - didn't feel comfortable leaving Stuff on the Beach to go Swimming - Like a Mini Kuta
karthickn123,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"Good beach, but need cleanness.Got lots of cafe, bars and beds to hire. Great for kids and viewing sunset. Water is bit warm and bit tides for surfers."
Kimkortekaas,Bali,Sep 2014,"Double Six Beach is okay. I think its a nice beach if you want to learn surfing because most of the time the ocean is very wild. It's not a good beach to go to with young children because swimming is a bit dangerous. If you are going with friends, reading a book or you just want to sunbathe it's fine to go here.  "
freedomwheels289,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,"stayed over the road ,so many great little bars and food places from all kinds of taste,great beach bars and music every night just got love it here!"
Ika P,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2015,"One of my fave beachto watch the sun goes down.Though you maybe have to avoid to come here in weekends, very very crowded.And looking for parking spots is another problems that you will faced."
Kezzas27,"Perth, Australia",Jan 2015,Bean bags on the beach with a cocktail and watch the sun go down. where in the world can you do that. This is a great way to spend the early evening and watch the sunset. Service is a wee slow but worth the wait. There a few to choose from along the beach front.Cheers
charly1684,"Krefeld, Germany",Jan 2015,Compared to last year (2014) this beach has strongly deteriorated. Unfortunately there's rubbish all over the beach and it is not a pleasure any more to stay there. Let's help the local people by showing more responsibility and keeping the beach clean.
josiewolff,3 contributions,Dec 2014,We had the best Christmas Day lunch ever at the Penthouse Restaurant (top Floor). the food was fantastic as well as the service and the view was incredible.
R0sie1,"Lombok, Indonesia",Dec 2014,Fantastic bar and restaurant right in the beach . The best NEw years eve ever! Inexpensive . Fantastic staff and loads of fun.
Shane Zieck,"Melbourne, Australia",Jan 2015,"This beach/road has been a destination for beach goers and night clubbers since the 1970s'. I have been there so many times I have lost count. Recently the clubs have returned to their glory days and are a lot of fun. Not the place for a quiet getaway, rather one of the hubs of daytime and night-time action. Leave it to you to decide..."
TravellerTeale,7 contributions,Dec 2014,"The sand looked brown and dirty and rubbish was all over the place. However, the restaurants along the beach looked nice."
Phase N,7 contributions,Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are are awful. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourist come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are pristine paradise.p so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc.  I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer.  This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built  over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person.  All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.   These bars also seem to be populated with pretentious people staring at their smart devices and taking selfies particularly 'la  Plancha'.  You're better off buying some bin tangs and go further up where there are no bars and enjoy the sunset on a towel with some quiet."
Jayne I,"Dongara, Australia",Dec 2014,"The Rooftop at the new Double Six Seminyak is the ultimate In rooftop bars. Views, service, the kids cinema section,  layout and design tick all the boxes. "
Giboos,Western Australia,Dec 2014,"My husband and I met up with some friends of ours for a night at the Double Six Rooftop Bar.What struck me was that we were asked before being advised of directions to where the bar was located what our names were, as though there was a door list (which there was not) and the bar was barely half full.The cocktails are super expensive and are no where near as good as others I have tried, Potato Head's cocktail list is much more extensive and better executed.The clincher was the food....My husband and I ordered the ""Big A$% Bucked of Chicken Wings"" which mentioned on the menu that it would be enough for 3 people at least - we are NOT huge eaters and what we received was a ""Big A$% Bucked of White Rice"" with some chicken wings on top - this was not good enough in my opinion.Service was slow - the waitress had to be chased down at times so we could order.I can see what type of ambiance that is being attempted here at the Double Six Roof Top bar but it is not been executed well at all.Food and beverage needs some work and service needs tidying up.Also nothing is more off putting that trying to fake elitism with pretending to have a door list when one does not exist - people don't want to put up with this kind of pretentious rubbish when they are on holidays - in fact no one should have to put up with it ever.Sorry to say but we are heading back to Bali in 2 days time and I don't plan on returning to Double Six at all - there are great little bars along the beach with plenty of local people who are friendly, welcoming provide great food and beverages at a reasonable price and certainly don't have door lists.... steer clear "
Dalla11,"Middle Dural, Australia",Dec 2014,This is a fantastic hotel. The staff are lovely and always have a smile for you. We had Christmas eve dinner in the new plantation restaurant and had a fabulous time. Then Christmas lunch in the Italian restaurant was once again great. Spa centre is amazing. Rooms are great. And kept emaculate  the manager is exstreamly welcoming and doing a great job. We can't say anything negative about this hotel
asri testiana m,22 contributions,Nov 2014,"This beach is so comfortable, amazing sunset view, love the local food, and the people is so friendly. Best place to spend the day at the beach with view budget. "
Koula D,"Melbourne, Australia",Aug 2014,A beautiful beach spot with all you could ask for in the way of eatery's..sit back and enjoy the Bali sunshine..Great mix of people..very relaxed indeed 
MerryMegsy,"Lara, Australia",Nov 2014,"As with Seimyak and Legian beach, the best time of day for double six beach is sunset.There are loads of little makeshift bars with locals selling beers. Possibly a bit less refined than Seminyak beach where you can sit in a restaurant/cafe and watch the sunset, double six is more for hanging with the locals, grabbing a beer and sitting on a deck chair or bean bag.Tends to be more Aussies here and it maybe a bit more laid back."
Finda Ayu,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Dec 2014,"My fave closest beach from kuta. Left side from entrance road is great for breakfast, there are a lot of restaurants serving nice and affordable breakfast. In the evening, the right side will be filled up with bean bags on the beach. You can enjoy the sunset while live music been played. Nice!"
Lynley T,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2014,"As an Aussie, I deem it my responsibility to go to one, or more Bali beaches for a Bintang and watch the sunset each trip.  On this occasion, I had guests staying with me at my Villa and I had assured them this should be ticked off their bucket list!   As always, several ""Beer boys"" descended upon us and I ordered 3 chilled beers, as we were ushered to some rather old and grubby looking laybacks.   As they were uncomfortable on our backs, we requested chairs.  Anyway, the beer was chilled to perfection.  As the beers were delivered I was advised that it would cost each of us IDR to sit on these chairs, about which I was most embarrassed in front of my friends.  I paid the bill when we left and added IDR for the uncomfortable laybacks, making it perfectly clear that such demands are damaging the image of 66 Beach and people will go elsewhere for their beers.On top of that, Taxi's were asking IDR100,000 to transfer back to Seminyak because of 66 being 1-way!    I said we would use the meter, and received the normal response ""meter broken"".   Who is going to tidy up this place and take it back to the happy and fun place to have a beer & watch the sunset??   I'll go back then."
whitejen,singapore,Sep 2014,Double Six Beach is good for swimming. It is not big waves and love cafes for drink during sunset. But i don't like when it too touristic. 
rsalas06,"Spring, TX",Dec 2014,"Black sand beach that could be nice if the trash, dogs and vendors were not everywhere. Our first day in Bali and we went down to the beach to let the kids play. I sat just to relax and couldn't do that because I was interrupted by a vendor every few minutes to buy something. There are tons of stray dogs and lots of trash probably coming up from Jakarta. "
diane cunningham,Edinburgh,Dec 2014,We wanted to sit and watch the sunset but there was rubbish music blaring out of speakers most of the way along the beach. Then we found a nicer place and sat on bean bags and watched the world go by and it was very entertaining with Hindu dancers to football games to kite sellers and the usual sarong ladies. Fine for one night but I'd hate it if it was every night. Taxi drivers try to charge a fortune to get back to our resort but you just have to keep trying till you get one that's fair price.
kingauto,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2014,"Brilliant location if you can afford the outside rotunda.Great atmosphere, food and beverages pricey but well worth it for a night out."
GinaT99,"Whangarei, New Zealand",Dec 2014,"The beach is really dirty. There is rubbish everywhere, bottles, broken glass etc. There is some attempt to clean in front of some hotels but the rubbish comes down open streams onto the beach and is everywhere. I would not swim there although the water is warm and there were a number of surfers out everyday. Sad as it is a long attractive beach but would not stay there again for the beach."
Cooker850,"Fremantle, Australia",Dec 2014,"Went here at about 4.30 to relax and watch the sunset. Unfortunately the weather did not allow us to do that, the skyline however was still pretty special. Bit hard to complain about a fairly neat beach, beanbags on the sand, music, cold drinks and a general happy atmosphere without being harrassed by vendors like at Kuta beach. Ended up moving into Capil bar when the rain started..live music..interactive..enjoyed it very much. "
Irma S,7 contributions,Nov 2014,The beach definitely better than kuta beach. It is well maintained and lots of restaurant around the beach area. You can seat at the relaxing bean bag and order a very cold beer. Enjoy the view without too much people around you.
Jeff P,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2014,"Long walks on a clean, organised beach.  Beach hawkers but not pushy at all.  Plenty of choice for bars and/or restaurants all along the beach"
Alilen,"Damascus, Oregon",Nov 2014,"Warm gorgeous blue water. Shallow a long way out. While not the worst we've seen in our travels it is sad to see such a lovely beach with so much plastic and litter. ""Hawkers"" selling trinkets, ice cream, fruit etc were overall friendly. If you were not interested a simple but firm ""no thank you"" was sufficient. On average about 50,000 reps for beach chairs for 2 for two people the day. "
Kelvin C,128 contributions,Dec 2013,"I really liked the Cocktails plus the cool night breeze but would not go to that area in the day , it is too hot and crowded then . For the Afternoon I recommend Sanur ."
Suzie O,"Sydney, Australia",Nov 2014,"This beach has lots of live music that starts around 6pm so,you,can drink..eat and watch the sunset."
138JoeS,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2014,not too much hawking. Plenty of beach side cafes   Like the bean bag dining.   Dry close to our hotel and walking distance to Gado Gado restaurant. Close to a wide choice of places to eat.  
mibial,"London, UK",Aug 2014,Pick your spot very carefully as distinct smell of sewage on parts of the beach! Whilst we were there it was extremely windy with HUGE waves so large parts of the water were out of bounds...a bit disappointing.
MvdK01,"Heemstede, The Netherlands",Nov 2014,This is a really nice place to watch the sunset and have a drink while watching. Many places have nice music and a great atmosphere.
rayj1011,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"the roof top bar is spectacular and if only for this you should visit the double six but i would recommended you visit the seminyak italian food restaurant as well. the food , sevice and wines are great. the setting is relaxing overlooking the pool so do go "
monalizzahl,The Netherlands,Apr 2014,beautiful stunning sunset <3 lots of cafe with good price. can relaxing have a drink or two while watching the sunset... what a beautiful life :)Double Six Beach is not really crowded and busy compare to Kuta Beach.
SoloSenior48,"Gold Coast, Australia",Oct 2014,Great place to chill at the end of the day with friends or alone sipping a beer and watching the glorious sunsets.  The guys who run the little bars are very friendly and love to stop for a chat.  Great atmosphere
E113N,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Nov 2014,"It is not the best beach in Bali, but it is quite nice to see sunset here. Lots of restaurants and cafes around."
Fauzia B,"Depok, Indonesia",Oct 2014,"The beach is not so crowded, not so many sales woman/man who force us to buy their things. The cafe's are colorful, I love the umbrellas and the lazy beach cushions to sit comfortably. It's a perfect spot to spend times watching sunset while drinking juices or beers (with not so expensive prices).. So relaxing."
JulieD2011,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2014,Freshly made in house pasta. Tuna was fantastic. Prices were reasonable for the quality and service. Drink prices were reasonable and the choices huge.
spotswood2014,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Good beach,  with warungs on sand.  Bean bag sunsets with cocktails,  very relaxing.  Capil Beach hut,  great iced coffees and rum and cokes..."
Hollioccky,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,Great stall shopping. Great Italian pizza restaurant opposite double six cafe too. Some stall owners were a little too pushy when just browsing
tony h,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2014,"What better way to watch the sun go down then having a few drinks at the beach, the part of Bali i love the most"
Debra W,"Sydney, Australia",Oct 2014,It is located right on the beach and is the sister resort to The Breezes so you can also access the resort and go in a golf buggy.
mizztic,"Moscow, Russia",Apr 2014,"Hot sun, big waves, relax, surf if you want, coconuts, massage, etc. Great fun with Acong's team! We miss you, guys!"
mcnairn2014,"New Plymouth, New Zealand",Oct 2014,"Beautiful hotel. Beautiful people. Service outstandingWhat is disappointing is when you look beyond the facade, you notice that the bottom of the showers and toilets have cracked tiles, where dirt piles up. Hard to believe this place has only been open a few months - already looked quite tired in places."
Jan P,"Darwin, Australia",Aug 2014,"We spent most afternoons on hired beach chairs until the sun went down, the breeze is so refreshing, its great to give the samll beach chair owners business, and you can purchase ice cold Bintangs for 20,000 each brought to you, tell you will be back and make sure the Bintangs are ice.  Relax and have fun with the Beach hawkers dont take it too seriously."
SamWeinstein,"Mosman Park, Australia",Sep 2014,This beach and the Ocean are extremely clean. The rip is not to bad and the waves are usually manageable but also big enough to learn to sure or have an ok fun surf. It is patrolled by trained lifeguards and has sweet ladies to massage you for about R50.000 to R80.000 of course they will ask much more. We like to rent the little lounges with umbrella's and then eat across from the Beach at The Blue Ocean Cafe where my fav is the Blue Ocean Salad and the pasta dishes but the seafood is also fantastic. We sit inside at the elevated lounges. It also has a little shower to wash the sand off.
GSewell85,Birmingham,Oct 2014,"It depends on what you're into but we got the shock of our lives when we arrived in Bali. We expected, quiet, idyllic And picturesque, instead we got busy, bustling and quite dirty! If you're a surfer, rasta or hippy this might be the beach for you, it's extremely crowded, with vendors, bean bags, surf schools, reggae bars, etc etc. However if you want some peace and quiet with calm seas go for the beach at Sanur which is thirty minute cab ride from double six."
avidtraveller,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2014,"Don't expect pristine sand - it is very dark grey and gritty walking along....also lots of sand in the waves on the water's edge. The water however looks stunning from the beach, the breeze is lovely and glorious sunsets.There are lots of dogs on the beach in the early a.m. - we are assuming with dog walkers - they often have four or five beautifully kept dogs in tow."
RichardConnery,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2013,"Don't forget your surfboard and relax with an ""on the beach"" massage between sets. Step up into one of the numerous hotels with direct beach access for a coffee or bite of lunch."
Snoopras,"Melbourne, Australia",Oct 2014,"Double six had great reviews but we found it a little lacking particularly in the bed availability around the pool - a struggle every day, the music late at night and the breakfast service."
Tracey H,"Adelaide, South Australia, Australia",Oct 2014,Tried surfing for my first time with Wayan Tembok.  Super fun.  Genuine nice guy. He also apparently works as a tour guide.
Jadeyp91,"Carrum Downs, Australia",Sep 2014,"I have been married on part of the double six beach near the Jayakarta and learnt to surf on another part near the padama! love the clean water and the locals are great as well! Love that I can shop from my seat, it can be a bit hard getting some of the sellers to accept no as answer but overall I rate it highly!"
Tony_mc27,"Liverpool, UK",Sep 2014,"My wife and I had a half day beginners surfing lesson here after travelling from Ubud for the day. The beach was clean and had a plentiful selection of bars and restaurants.Yes there are hawkers and yes they are a pain, but this is common on every beach across Asia that I have been to. I found as long as you said no and were polite they would leave you alone. The waves were great for learning to surf and as long as you follow the rules of the flags it is a safe place to swim"
gurugheryl,"Adelaide, Australia",Oct 2014,"Current music, sunset, Bintangs in bean bags without the ++. Surf was quite huge as we watched the surfers."
LouFran76,"Wodonga, Australia",Jul 2014,"Definitely better beaches for a swim down south.  An example of why most villas have pools.  If still undecided on going for a swim, take an early morning stroll along the beach and see the rubbish washed up!"
RodSutt,"Melbourne, Australia",Sep 2014,"We have three kids under 5 and this beach is perfect. Heaps of sand, a little bit of white wash and plenty of food options. The new Double Six hotel also looks nice, we ate at Cocoon and the food was great."
Susan R,6 contributions,Sep 2014,Double Six is one of the nicer sections of Seminyak Beach.  Great water play for little kids with loads of beach to play on.  Surfing great for older kids.   Grab yourself a banana loiunge or beanbag and spend the afternoon there - you will have to order drinks and food to stay on the furniture but believe me you will want to.  Stay for the sunset and listen to the live music whilst waves are crashing - what a better way to spend a casual evening.
mjw_au,"Brighton, Australia",Aug 2014,Surf too big to swim on 1 day but ok the other. many service providers to rent surfboard hie - prices vary but quite cheap
rosemaryVenusBay,Venus Bay,Sep 2014,"This place is supposedly renowned for it's pasta dishes - over our stay, we had three different pasta meals, and all of them were quite ordinary.  However, the raw tuna with pomegranate, and the delicious calamari entres were excellent.  Service good."
JamesSharpe,"London, UK",Sep 2014,"Its a real let down to find such an idyllic setting ruined by litter, raw sewage and soiled nappies / sanitary products.  I know this is a developing country, but the local authority would do better to clean the beach overnight. On the plus side, plenty of loungers and bars to rest at, Bali Joes, is fun and beer is cheap and cold!"
Susan W,Kuta,Aug 2014,Recently I visited double six beach and very surprised to see it's very crowded.So many new cafés / restaurants and equipped with bean bag on the sand.Quite relaxing and fairly economical if you like to sip your coconut or something stronger while watching sun set. The view is nice and nobody will bother you if you stay a bit long with only one drink.
Belinda B,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2014,"Loved this beach, even the beach sellers are gorgeous people.Mer many a swim buddy, shared many stories and Bintangs, sunset memories"
Zimmer1973,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"This was a fantastic experience, as soon as you walk along the path you can hear the house music, smell thew food in the air and as soon as you are there with the drinks and the beach it is a buzz, the vibe is party and you will feel it straight away"
ltanudib,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2014,The beach is crowded. Lots of drinking place nearby. much like the kuta beach. Suggest to go here by taxi as walking from seminyak without knowing the way will be a long long walk. 
NararaToni,Narara,Aug 2014,My favourite time here is in the late afternoon and evening with the lovely lit umbrellas and the beanbags. Sit and sip your cocktail and enjoy the live music on the beach. Totally relax with a foot massage as well. Sunbaking and surfing is over rated!
MartinC4,"Surfers Paradise, Australia",Aug 2014,Meal was tasty and service good.  The pasta was slightly undercooked but overall the meal was very enjoyable.
siamsabu2014,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,Nothing really to dislike here..you can take a leisurely stroll and find a very affordable place to eat along here..having a meal while sitting on the beach in bean bags is the way to go..
brightl,Victoria,Aug 2014,"Safe, magnificent waves, friendly, lots of eating places on beach, Bintang in a bean bag watching the world go by! Or watching planes arrive  and depart"
Jodi78,Gold Coast,Jul 2014,"I always stay here every trip, much cleaner than it used to be and no whee near as many dogs. Service offered here with beach lounge rentals is always great and happy to help you. Can't go past sunset drinks here. "
Nicole L,"Kota Kinabalu, Malaysia",Feb 2014,the sea is full of rubbish. but my first surfing experience was great! around 15 mins walk from my hotel. 
Roger F,"Tiburon, CA",Aug 2014,"Thinking of taking a surf class here which would be cool, as waves are plentiful and fast but not immense. But this isn't a beach you go to for sheer beauty. Sand not great and some trash about. Seminyak beach not beautiful either but wider and some nice chill cafés with music, right on the sand. Looks best at night. "
Regina W,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2014,"Great place for Sunset drinks and watch an amazing sunset ,especially from the roof top.A little more pricey than on the beach,but a must do whilst in Seminyak "
leaguegirl,"City of Greater Geelong, Australia",Aug 2014,"The lifeguards here are very friendly and there's no shortage of sarongs and beads to buy from the hawker ladies (can get a bit overwhelming at times), beach chairs for hire and cold beer for sale, if you want it (I didn't).The beach itself is pretty ordinary when compared with say Langkawi or Kota Kinabalu in Malaysia. It's a bit grubby and there's way too many people. You will be hassled to buy sarongs and beads. Luckily the ladies are nice, but they are persistent."
Oli422,"Sydney, Australia",Jul 2014,Enjoyed morning walks and hanging out watching spectacular sunsets with great music from surrounding warungs.
chelsren18,"Geraldton, Australia",Aug 2014,Picture perfect with lots of day beds to hire and perfect sunsets. Alot cleaner than Seminyak beach.
Edmond C,"Bellagio, Italy",Aug 2014,"Lovely beach but remember to negotiate for the umbrella and seats.  Prices could varies up to 100,000Rp."
J S,23 contributions,Aug 2014,"I learned surfing here on baby boards. A lot of fun, although it has little to do with real green wave surfing."
Isabel C,"Manila, Philippines",Aug 2014,It's a wide sandy beach and the waves are great for surfing! We rented a tent and loungers and spent the morning relaxing and watching all the various beach activities.
Andrew G,"Brooklyn, New York, United States",Jul 2014,"Not a quiet place, but it's an amazing setting. We stayed in more laid-back Sanur, but traveled the 20 minutes to double-six to take surfing lessons (at Rip Curl -- awesome place!).  There's a bit of traffic and lots of folks on the beach in July/August, but the weather and the waves were great.  Lots of places to get out of the sun and get a drink, too.  This beach reminds us of some of the places in Thailand, but it's actually cleaners and the waves are much better (for surfing)."
Kirmatt,"Mansfield, Australia",Jul 2014,A very relaxed atmosphere to sit in a bean bag and enjoy the sunset while sipping on a cocktail.. :)
BenMiz,"Adelaide, Australia",Jul 2014,"When the swell and tides are right double six has a really nice little beach break. The last 3 days of our stay I manged to get my 5 and 7 year olds standing up and surfing in the perfectly sized kid friendly waves. It's not always like this however and small kids under 5 should be watched at all times. The beach itself is your typical volcanic sand, it was relatively clean and there are some nice little restaurants that you can dine at, sitting in bean bags dining at sunset on the beach was great. I had some nice service of Mahi Mahi there washed down with a few cold Bins you couldn't go wrong. "
saverioca,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Jul 2014,"I like the warung (little restaurants on the beach) but since five years ago waves of concrets are destroyng part of the beach with new ""luxury"" hotels ...but the atmospere is still nice and you can walk in the afternoon looking for the wonderful incredible everyday sunset ."
joe036,perth,Aug 2014,"Well, This amazing restaurant is set within an amazing hotel. The hotel is awesome enough but wait till you taste the food. I had the squid ink tagliatelle which I swapped for what was originally served with rice, The flavours were amazing. The starter was a bruschetta, traditional and perfect. Do yourselves a favour and try this place foe a reasonable price."
Barry M,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2014,Even if surfing isn't your thing...head down jalan double six until you hit the beach. I prefer the area to the right of that intersection. Now hang around until after sunset. Many of the beach cafes bring out bean bags for you to slide into and watch the magic. Its a photographers dream. |This is an ideal place to learn to surf as well.
adit3005,"Hong Kong, China",Jul 2014,"Like - Nice sand and strong waves for an interesting swim.  Nice bars with live music in the evening on makeshift stagesDislike - Constant touts for foot massage, drinks, fruits and trinkets.  Could do with half of the number of requests "
Jacaydan,"Moranbah, Australia",Jul 2014,"Our children did surfing lessons on double 6 beach with one of the local surfing groups. I highly recommend this experience.  There is a strong current in some places, but the surf instructors are very helpful reminding people where the best places are. (They looked a bit intimidating when we first met them, but they were lovely and incredibly helpful). The sand is black sand rather than golden, so it looks dirty... but you get used to the look. There seem to be a lot of dogs roaming along the beach, but they were well behaved. I definately recommend purchasing a cocktail or  Bintang from one of the beach front eateries, hiring a chair / umbrella and sitting back to watch the surfers and the sunset."
Scott F,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,Double Six is covered with beach umbrellas and full of holiday makers.  The water can have a strong undertow but it has a gentle sandy bottom.
Nocky-1961,"Margaret River, Australia",Jul 2014,"Looks Dirty compared to Kuta Beach and some sleazy characters hanging around, eating places look ok but the rest is a let down, not for us"
Penelope3110,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Mar 2014,"So many tourists are fascinated by the famous Double Six Beach and is called ""five star beach"" but seriously, the place is completely packed with tourists, and domestic tourists. The domestic tourists makes you feel so uncomfortable cause all they do is stand in front of you and take photos or videos of you sun bathing or running. And not just one person does this, it's a whole group of men! There are so many other great beaches on Bali! "
Monica A,2 contributions,Jul 2014,"I liked that there are a number of restaurants along the shore, where we could have a few snacks and drinks.Hotel Horison (our hotel) has a designated lounge area here, which was good for us. It's a quick 5-minute walk from our hotel.What I didn't like was that there were so much plastic garbage (food packaging) in the water. I lost interest in swimming. I wish government invests in coastal clean-up so tourists can appreciate the beach more."
Veronica H,"Perth, Australia",May 2014,"Best meals while over the ocean, such a variety to choose from.loved them all tried all restaurant s , "
Michelle19682014,"Melbourne, Australia",Jul 2014,"Visited this beach a few times... deck chairs always available to hire for 50,000 rupiah for 2 ($AUD5) and plenty of fully racked eskys to purchase a cold Bintang! Surfboard hire was popular with the kids and great value for money - just check the board thoroughly beforehand as you will have to pay for any damage such as lost fins etc. Though too many hawkers, the women attack you from all ends - hair, nails, adorning your body with jewellery - so much so you don't know what you have/haven't paid for - and they get grumpy if you don't buy from them at all - be stern when saying NO! Pity there were no set up for massages on the beach - you can get one but you have to ask until a random lady drops her bundle and offers - you can probably get better and cheaper elsewhere but if that's what you need at the time then... Late afternoon sees the beach converted with bean bags for cocktails and sunset watching, gets quite busy but the scene looks great!"
hickles74,"Perth, Australia",Feb 2014,"Cheap, lots of activity going on and cocktails a few hundred metres from the ocean's edge at sunset - worth a visit."
daCoach420,"Boracay, Philippines",Jun 2014,Double Six is one of those laid back beaches with a surfer culture vibe. Nice little restaurants and bars dot the beach front and there are surf schools everywhere. It's just more upscale and less crowded than the beaches of Kuta or Legian.
Aussa2012,"Richmond, Canada",May 2014,"They are a loud pub like place, fun to watch a game but the food is only ok. My partner and I both had a burger and it was alright. They had delicious onion rings but the portion was really small for a side order."
Omri B,"Paris, France",Apr 2014,the beach is becoming more and more dirty. Atmosphere is not what it used to be. I don't go there anymore.
adrian_stevens98,"Riga, Latvia",Jan 2014,"Great location, not many people. Love the food and bean bag bars. The drinks come in the most awesome cups."
nogenmania,"Surabaya, Indonesia",May 2014,Beach was quite crowded when it comes to sunset. Very beautiful. love it! Perfect for sunbathing or just relaxing enjoy the view.
SunSeeker S,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,"Double six is a great beach to relax and watch the sunset.There are many bars and restaurants on the beach to chill out in, relax and listen to music.Double six is less hectic than Kuta beach and many Balinese come here to socialise.Nice way to spend an evening, drink a cold beer, eat pizza......without breaking the bank."
Adele R,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2014,Andy  is wonderful.  Very friendly and nothing is too much trouble.  Very cheap hire of sun lounges for the day.  $2.50 or can sit on the bean bags and watch the sunset while having a Bintang or Smirnoff.  
chrisraywhitebali,"Bali, Indonesia",Feb 2014,"Great beach for sunset, relaxing and less touristy like Kuta beach.Could spend every day there if only they had wifi so I could work!"
frizi1,"Adelaide, Australia",May 2014,"Sunset and Bakso (meatball soup), sitting on a comfortable beanbag with a loved one... Nice!!!! Very crowded on a Sunday after 4 pm so they may run out of soup by 7 pm or hard to find a seat unless you share a coffee table with others."
angiegala24,"Melbourne, Australia",May 2014,"We sat on the chairs here on  two occasions during our stay in Bali.   We were actually staying closer to Potato Head but found the beach calmer and the life guards more alert in this area.  The people hiring the chairs out were nicer- and didn't keep on asking when are you leaving.  We paid $5 and stayed here to watch the sunset on one occasion.  The massages were cheaper here and you could also buy any type of fruit- pineapple, mango, dragonfruit, mangosteen etc etc.   you could buy beer, sprite and chilli butter corn.   The people selling bracelets, sarongs etc were friendlier and not overly pushy.  I did a lot of my sarong and bracelet shopping here.  The atmosphere was GREAT and FRIENDLY."
markymark40,18 contributions,May 2014,Plenty of places to sit on the beach and watch the sun set.breathtaking views plenty of familys and couples a must see 
Hazcom,10 contributions,Mar 2014,"great place to catch up with expats from all over , great feel with familiar people great information found here on what to do and what to watch out for!!"
Bali777,"Perth, Australia",Apr 2014,"We have travelled to Bali every year for about the last 15 years in March/ April. Sitting on the beach with a cocktail or beer, listening to the waves break & watching the sunset was romantic & relaxing  before strolling to one of the beach side restaurants for dinner. Sadly our sunset  experience this year was totally ruined by by the absolutely  deafening Afro American music blaring out from Double Six making it impossible to talk to one another let alone hear the waves. We had to walk a fair way to find a restaurant along the beachfront where the thumping music did not intrude. We are not against the  music per se but the volume should be kept within reasonable levels so that everyone can appreciate whatever they have come for. Happy hour by the pool with duh duh duh music is fine for those who enjoy it but it should not be so overly invasive & spoil the evening for more peaceful beach  sunset lovers.   The sunset magic has been lost.......we won't be back."
PeggyPesik,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2014,"I love this beach!I go to Double Six beach almost every day ^_^I like the wonderful sunset view, lovely people from all countries, and lots of bar."
Jacki B,"Melbourne, Australia",Mar 2014,Great  place to watch the sunset pre dinner.  Live music - great cocktails!!.  The Bean Bags come out later in the afternoon so you don't really get a feel for the night life earlier in the day.  Champlung (chinese umbrellas) has good service and fantastic music!!  I can't recommend the food at any particular place and would probably recommend you eat elsewhere but it is well worth the visit just for a few drinks!!
Jasb10,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2014,"Rubbish every where along the footpath, beach crowded yet did not look inviting.  Hawkers blocking the way to the beach overcrowded with hotels - makes Sufers Paradise look like heaven and I try to avoid Surfers P!"
Sarah W,"Adelaide River, Australia",Apr 2014,"We stayed a small walk from double six beach, regularly we would walk down there. Beach was fairly clean and looks good, not as amazing as some beaches. Good for a swim and lots of keen surfers. Good atmosphere, especially around sunset. There are a few nice restaurants and places for a cocktail while there."
SaigonGal,"Liverpool, UK",Apr 2014,"Beach was fine with sunbeds and places to buy drinks. Sunsets amazing. I was not so happy to see that dog seems to have been trained to toilet in the shallow waters, and in fact the number of dogs toileting on the beach makes you wonder what the children, and us, are sitting,walking in. Still, it's nice to see that the dogs are looked after!"
Mandy B,"Perth, Western Australia, Australia",Mar 2014,"So enjoyed the atmosphere of kids playing, sunset cocktails, music and a great meal. Awesome!Its a short walk from Double Six street all of the little bars and restuarants service great food. They don't look like much but they are just fab."
Kanuctraveller,"London, Canada",Mar 2014,Great weather and waves but they need to rake the beach often because of garbage in the water. We paid $10 for 2 chairs and umbrellas each day. There are a to. Of vendors who ask you to buy their stuff.  Buy something and they stop. 
BrianJay2014,"Yangon (Rangoon), Myanmar",Jan 2014,"Bali has lost its romantic and exotic touch. The beach is crowded and noisy. Rubbish and people gather in the evenings to see the sunset. Water is never clear, chalky and waves too dangerous to swim. My sister's best friend's husband drowned and died in those waters there. The best thing is the untouched sunsets that fortunately, mankind cannot abuse it yet."
Ninja_Cats,"Perth, Australia",Mar 2014,We came here to see the sunset and it was absolutey amazing. However sadly the beach is littered with so much garbage. Still i would come here again. Right next to the beach is restraunts and hotels.
rickyrose,"pasay, philippines",Mar 2014,"No white sands, plenty of trash, not a good place for kids.  Better beaches in the Philippines and Thailand."
Maria P,"Perm, Russia",Mar 2014,"Unfortunately,i should say that water and beach became full of gabbage and plastic!This change happened just in one year and i don't have any explanation why.Many people got sick because of this water and got a ""bali belly' or ear infection!This beach still have good waves for surfing and its beautiful that's why i hope local goverment will do something!"
Karina,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2014,"Went here to hunt sunset. The view is awesome but it wasn't clean beach. Lot of plastic bag, and somehow stingy in some spot near Legian Beach."
June W,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Mar 2014,Much better than Kuta Beach for sure. Less crowded and cleaner. Rent a bodyboard for some good fun. For 2 beach chairs and a bodyboard we paid IDR 50 000. Make sure you bargain because they will always start with a ridiculous price. The waves are quite strong which was great for bodyboarding but it's not a place to just chill in the water. 
John250255,"Parkwood, Australia",Feb 2014,"The beach host left nothing wanting.  Great lounges and beach umbrellas, food and drinks easily available, all at a great rate. "
Xinni,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2014,"Rode to double 6 beach on a bike. The beach does not have crystal blue waters but it has beautiful waves for surfing. The beach is lined with beach chairs for tourist to suntan. There are many small shops selling souvenirs, clothes & paintings along the streets before reaching double 6."
Kris G,Walvis Bay,Jan 2014,"A great beach to visit , clean for indo , liked the a fine chilled atmosphere. Didn't really get hassled either. "
vee_vita,"Seminyak, Indonesia",Aug 2013,"I like to hang out in the sun beds provided by cafes in the beach. The beach is not as dirty as Dhyana Pura (Seminyak) beach which is the neighbor beach of Double Six. If you want to surf, it's not a quite great spot because the tides is not as good as in Kuta Beach. But it's great place to hang out with plentiful cafes at cheap price."
geromam,"Geraldton, Australia",Jan 2014,"The beach was strewn with rubbish and looked absolutely dreadful. I would not walk bare footed along here never knowing what was laying beneath the sand. According to locals trying to clean up, the rubbish drifts on the currents during storms from Java. I was impressed with the young lad I spoke with trying to clean up his ""patch"" for no wages. I have been to this area when it was clean, but avoid the area in January and February."
Sarah Abd Rahim,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Jan 2014,A quiet beach away from the crowds of Kuta. Great for an afternoon jog along the lengthy stretch of beach. There are a number of cafes along the beach that have tables or bean bags for you to chill at and enjoy the sights. Surfing lessons also available from the locals. Great for sunsets!
Michelle T,"Bali, Indonesia",Oct 2013,"Well kept beach, with a super long stretch of white sand. Bars and restaurants overlook the ocean. You can rent a sunbed for a small amount of money on the sand. Lovely for an evening stroll. Watch the sunset here!!"
MariaSushi H,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Dec 2013,"When we where there beach was filled with empty bottles, plastic garbage and beach huts did not look inviting."
Andrew K,"Melbourne, Australia",Dec 2013,"The beach after it has been cleaned daily is ok.  Not quite what i expected early morning walks to be with all the debris washed up on the beach.  Afternoon and sunset it was like a totally different beach, clean and lots of activity"
Diana T,Quito,Dec 2013,"There were a lot of souvenirs stores in the Jalan Arjuna street at Double Six Beach, Seminyak.  Coming from South America i was not that impressed by the souvenirs.  In fact when I travel to a country I usually like to get souvenirs related to the traditional hand crafts/products of that country, but at Jalan Arjuna street most of the products I found were t-shirts/tops of football/basketball famous teams and very few handicraft and affordable products.  Most of the sellers have a rude and not kind attitude if you just have a look at their products and don't buy anything, but if you end up buying something they set prices waay higher than what the products are supposed to cost.  Anyways, I walked several times through this street and I found out an alley at the right side of Jl Arjuna if you face the beach, right before 66 Corner sign, so the third store had a good and fair seller, he was kind, not pushy and he even gave me a good discount, so if you are around this area and want to buy souvenirs and don't want to feel any pressure to buy anything you may want to give it a try to this store."
mhrani21,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Jan 2014,"I went there around 2 pm, there are lots of cafe and hangout place by the beach. The beach is not that clean tho' unlike the Petitenget beach. but the wave's great, nice view. Great place to spend your afternoon and just chill to watch sunset"
Danella C,"Newcastle, Australia",Dec 2013,"This beach was full of litter, both in the water and piles or rubbish on the beach itself. I had hoped for a swim but I'm not a huge fan of being covered in floating garbage. Very disappointing."
Jill K,"Perth, Australia",Nov 2013,Love the people on the beach. it was the wet season while we were there so it was mostly locals on the beach
JohnDaglas1,"Melbourne, Australia",Jun 2013,Good Close Beach which is normally busy on good days-But except soccer rackets ect A place to visit and swim in but Much better beaches available in Bali. SEARCH AT INFO STAND AND MANY FANTASTIC BEACHES FOR SAND LOVERS.
Dawn C,"Perth, Australia",May 2013,"This beach is quite nice as far as Bali beaches go.  Being from Scarborough Beach in WA it doesn't compare.  Ari Lobre is a local surfer who managers the lounge chairs right in front of the O-CE-N Outrigger and his service is awesome, not to mention his friendly conversation and gorgeous smile."
Jill D,"Nerang, Australia",Nov 2013,"An amazing experience, relaxing in a beanbag with a cocktail watching the sunset, a must do while in Bali."
Gabbi66,"Melbourne, Australia",Nov 2013,"Since our last visit in May, this time around, the beach was a lot cleaner, enjoyed a nice long stroll and with life guards on duty, this gives peace of mind to families traveling with kids..."
David W,"Viti Levu, Fiji",Oct 2013,"Double Six Beach is the most convenient beach to access if you are staying at Seminyak and appears to be very popular judging by the number of people who use it. There are a number of bars and restaurants along the beachfront but they are only of average standard based on our experience. At least the bintang was cold. There are plenty of beach chairs for hire and plenty of hawkers selling hats, sunglasses and other tourist items. This is a surf beach and is well positioned for the sunsets which can be really spectacular. One word of warning, you may have to wait a while to get a cab back to your accommodation from the beach, especially around peak times and the cab route back to the main street in Seminyak is not the same as the direct route to the beach so therefore costs more. Also some of the entertainment attractions that used to be at Double Six have been dismantled to make way for a new hotel/apartment development."
dani73Melbourne,melbourne,Nov 2013,Walked here from my hotel in seminyak a couple of times . Had to dodge dog poo and various rubbish items . Up on pathway rubbish piled every where . Would never swim in the water as there is sewarge spilling in to the sea
JalanJalan69,156 contributions,Nov 2013,"Surf: Waves just close out on you most of the time.Beach: Mostly dirtyBars: Lots of friendly bars on the beach -- the main attractionRestaurants: Mostly crap. Good food is in SeminyakClubs: I wouldn't go to any of them there.........Hotels: I wouldn't seriously rate any of them all that highly, they have location, but quality is generally lacking.Most annoying is the parking ticket sellers who at best are highly agro and try to rip each person who enters the beach off. Even people who they know they still try to rip off. From the time of entry to the beach there's a sense of a need to be on your guard, and that's true.The beach is full of rubbish piled up on the road.The beach is packed full of corrupt beggars who are mostly enslaved children, who will do anything to get a buck out of you, and steal your wallet or phone if they can, and swear you down in a second if you don't hand them the money that they expect from you.Other than that it's a great place to visit !!!!!!!"
Kbazi,"Perth, Australia",Oct 2013,"Was quite filled with restaurants along the beach, many seemed to have tax on the higher side and lots of locals with scooters, otherwise beach is nice lots of tourists!"
Fatmadcat,"East Drayton, UK",Oct 2013,Took surf lessons here... better to come at night when you can't see how filthy the place is - there is a whole lot of bars and restaurants lining the beach and the view is so much better... cos you can't see the debris!
Pat S,"Sydney, Australia",Apr 2013,"Had enjoy a morning walk on a great beach unspoiled by crowded like Kuta ., is a peaceful beach n if you go early in morning you can see local woman praying n offering laid on the beach"
22jenny22_12,"Hunter Valley, Australia",Nov 2012,"its like bali, sunset,beer and shopping or just relax....its up to you....I liked it ...its what you want....say no if you dont want it.....pay no more than $3-00 to $5.00aud for sunnies otherwise tell thm no and mean no...they are nice but we need to tell them our price and thats it, cos they will come down....make sure yr not arguing with them,,,,,cos sometimes its like 20cents to us.theres a guy called woody woodpecker....sellling carvings...( loved them but he started out at $50,,,,I said $20 and he left and came back 3 times,,,,He is very funny....I brought it for $24 and had it shipped back at a local post place...only about 15$"
Lily A,"Birmingham, UK",Oct 2013,"As far as beaches go Double 6 beach is a true Bali experience in itself. The sunbed guys will try and rip you off by saying 2 beds are 80,000 when you can get them for 50,000. Then once you've actually settled on your sunbeds which granted are very comfy, half of the hawkers in Bali will descend on you and offer you anything from tattoos to pedicures to ice-creams (he was actually a favourite). Even pretending to be asleep doesn't work! We are pretty laid back so it didn't bother us too much but when two balinese families set up camp behind our sunbeds and kept knocking into them we were starting to wonder if we were on Punk'd. The beach itself isn't that pretty but I could people watch all day and there are plenty of beach dining and bar options if sun bathing gets a bit too much. The sea is great for surfing not so much for swimming but there are a few guys offering surfing lessons along the beach if you want to try it."
Ffteo,15 contributions,Sep 2013,"Similar to Jimbaran, along the stretch of Seminyak Beach.If you're looking for a place with less crowd. Dive, dine, enjoying sunset, jogging n etc"
Janet H,auckland,Sep 2013,"Lovely beach for swimming, surfing or just lazing on a beach chair and watching the world go by. Hawkers start to get annoying by mid morning, even when you pretend to be asleep! The ice cream man was always welcome though.Surf school was popular. Very busy at night with music, beanbags to lounge on and lit up cubes for tables and fireworks going off."
David S,"Bali, Indonesia",Apr 2013,"The sand is white and clear. The beach full of resort and restaurant. So many people jog and play soccer in the evening time. The wave is not that high, safe for the children to play. It used to lot quieter 6 years back when this beach wasn't that popular. "
John F,Perth,Sep 2013,"Black like dirt and smells like sewer. The sewer creek drops into the ocean making the beach even more smelly and unpleasant. And then people are wondering why they get ""bali belly"" Do not swim there as you literally swim in sewer."
tonyoneteam,"London, UK",Sep 2013,"Take a bed, let them serve you a drink, watch the learner surfers fight the waves, water is clean, locals touts friendly, easy access, great for sunsets too.."
sonbeth,perth,Sep 2013,"Dirty beach with a constant sewage smell.  Don't know why people spend their days on the sunbeds here.  Too many stray dogs and hawkers.  If you want a beach holiday, don't stay in Seminyak."
londobali,"Legian, Indonesia",Sep 2013,"It's a very nice beach to learn surfing as the waves are very forgiving and the sand-bottom is not as dangerous as coral bottom.. or just to chill and sun-bask... or to see the sunset..Lazy chairs and big umbrellas for rent everywhere, as well as boogieboards, surfboards, beach-tennis, etc.. soft drinks and beer, and a few local food stands are there.. For western lunch, try one of the restaurants on the otherside of the streets.. some even offers beach-deliveries.. :)BUT:- could be very busy on weekends, specially on high season. TIP: go to the very ends of the street, and you'll find less crowd there..- on those busy weekends parking can be a problem. TIP: DONT GO THERE in car, take motorbikes or bicycle instead. Some (usually local tourists) insist on going there with their (rental) car and makes it a total mess, as it's a dead-end street. - local government/village could make a fortune if they would make a pay-shower booth and pay-toilet there."
Ashley V,"Brighton, Australia",Sep 2013,"Warungs are right on the beach with coloured lanterns and lights and bean bags to lie down in. It is an ideal place to hang about and watch the sun go down whilst paying reasonable/cheap prices for Bintang and cocktails and ""maybe"" listening to some decent music."
Haydochick,"Ascot Vale, Australia",Sep 2013,"another nice beach in Bali, however Kuta still was best re: sand quality and surf.Many places to relax, but haggle hard for you beachfront piece of lounge.    Do not allow any peddlers to come to you  - allow one, you attract many.....  arghhhhh"
Farfaraway1972,"Perth, Australia",Sep 2013,"This was the second time we had visited a beach in Bali. In July 2012 we went to Echo Beach, which is nice, but not good for kids. Just for surfers and a great place to eat & drink.This time (Sep 2013) we visited Double Six Beach, which was nice, but your could smell the sewerage, which was not so great. Not too many people ""stalking"" you with ""crap"" and after politely saying no, they went away. It is pretty clean, not too much rubbish, and the kids had a ball"
BundyRed,"Duncraig, Australia",Aug 2013,"A great spot to watch the sun go down whilst sitting in a bean bag with a bintang.Can be quite dirty with rubbish / drains in places along with the steady stream of hawkers trying to sell their wares.There is however some excellent eateries just up the road on 66 street , this end seems to be going through a transformation with new building and renovations happening in the vicinity."
Paul M,"Munich, Germany",Aug 2013,"Great beach for surfing or enjoying the waves, but avoid the rip-off sunshade and loungers - they charge up tp 250,000 rupiah. Most other places in Bali charge nothing if you eat at their restaurant. "
jaylowe,"Hong Kong, China",Sep 2013,"Many surfing coaches teach classes here, so that it's quite busy. There are two big drains that pour smelly water into the sea... So, we didn't really swim there. The sidewalk around the beach smells like urine. I guess it's okay to sunbath and watch people surfing. But if you're picking a nice secluded beach, go somewhere else."
joeyjoeo,"Brisbane, Australia",Aug 2013,"This is a nice beach if you can see past the garbage.  Like the title says, this is the Dirty end of town.  The beaches further south are much cleaner.  The footpaths here are very bad also.  The area seems very popular for some but not me.  I could not wait to get out of this area."
sara m,"Saint Louis, MO",Sep 2013,"After reading all the reviews about the Seminyak area we booked 3 nights at Villa Kresna in Seminyak. The villa itself was nice but the Seminyak beach and area was dirty, difficult to walk around in (poor sidewalks and tons of motorbikes) and the shops were expensive. This area seems better suited to younger patrons who like to party on the beach. The beach itself was not clean and at various points sewage water came into the ocean from the land. The streets of Seminyak square were so busy with cars and scooters that you had to watch where you walked to not trip over the small edge of sidewalk. The food at the 6 restaurants we ate in was typical Bali, wonderful and inexpensive but you don't have to be there. We have now been in Sanur for 6 nights and are so much happier. Clean beaches, wonderful sidewalk on the beach and in town. Lots of choices for the wonderful food and generally a more relaxed, beach vacation."
markbutt62,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,has really nice restaurants but will cost you for parking and needs public toilets but so does most popular beaches in Bali
KLWebb,Rockingham,Aug 2013,Absolutely a must while in Bali. Sit in a bean bag on the beach with a cocktail or two and a bite to eat and watch the sun go down. This is always a highlight and a must do when your in Bali.
Pieces of P,5 contributions,Jul 2013,"We had planned a pretty last minute exchanging of vows with just family and close friends and we were recommended by Alam Warna Resort to get in touch with a wedding planner, Mita, who understood that we were on a tight budget as we just had 2 weddings already. She still obliged in providing a restaurant with an affordable and fresh seafood dinner set and set up a romantic table with lanterns for us. It took all of us by surprise as we arrived at the location. It wasn't too overly crowded and the service was superb. The seafood was so fresh and well cooked. If you ever go to go to Double Six Beach, look for Amazing Bali Cafe (ABC). And if you're look for a wedding planner or event organizer for weddings, anniversaries etc. do contact info@batikbaliwedding.com and look them up at http://www.batikbaliwedding.com/. Had an unforgettable time. It was perfect! Coincidentally they had fireworks which just added more 'wow' factor to our little reception. The only regret was that we didn't make the reception during sunset and didn't have enough funds to get a photographer and other services from the full package."
Mia R,"Perth, Australia",Aug 2013,started off very quiet - we were the only people there and we going to leave. Decided to stay for one more drink and once the band came on - we realised that this could be the making of a good nite - it turned out to be a fantastic nite!
MirantiKemala,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Aug 2013,"I particularly like this beach in the morning. Not too crowded as Kuta. Morning run from Double Six - Kuta, or Double Six - Seminyak is a good track. Try running with your feet and feel the sand and the breeze!"
AliyaCHL,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",Aug 2013,Don't find it spectacularly beautiful - but the beach is clean and probably not as crowded as Kuta beach. 
johnberndt,"New York City, NY",Jul 2013,12 noon till 3am this is the beach where all the action is. grab a bottle of wine and walk up and down the strip.
Fraser G,"Sydney, Australia",Aug 2013,Beach is great and is home to some really cool bars with music at sundown. Mixture of cheap bars and really trendy (but still pretty cheap). Beach has everything you would want it to have and is right next to Legian markets etc. Worth doing!!
Mich_Vintcent,"Dubai, United Arab Emirates",Jul 2013,"We came to 66 beach because the branded surf schools (rip curl and quicksilver ) are here and our children wanted to learn to surf. The surf conditions are relatively safe here most of the time compared to beaches further north, but you do need to be on high alert at all times because there can suddenly be strong currents and rips. What I disliked most about this beach was the constant harassment from beach hawkers. If offered something once, and you decline it, and they go away, that is fine. But many times they won't accept a single 'no, thank you' and the same person will come back 5 or 6 times in the same day! Some kind of intervention is required because the beach hawking is out of control. "
Sarahyoung28,"Brisbane, Australia",Jun 2013,"We took our young children down to Double six beach to swim in the afternoon and it was quite nice on the sun lounges, but by 4:30-5:00 pm the beach was full of drunk Aussies with young indo women and it was an awful place for a young family. Would never go there again. Slightly further up the beach in Seminyak is much nicer, with bean bags on the beach and great cafes with yummy woodfired pizzas, not to mention a much nicer family atmosphere. Double six beach is dirty and sleazy YUK!"
Liverpool051,"Singapore, Singapore",Aug 2013,"A massive and very busy beach. Sand was nice, and sea is shallow and water is clean.  Good to learn to surf. My 8 yr old and husband paid $50 (US) for a 90 min lesson. Make sure you stay in the yellow and red flags though as it can be dangerous.  There was a report in the paper of a tourist drowning this week.  We paid 270 rup for 3 beds and drinks all day ( beer and water) and 2 surf boards too.  This was at the far end of the beach where the vendor has Bob Marley decor.  I think it's called One Love.  The constant sellers of silver tat, bracelets, CD,s, DVD,s, magazines and fruit are very annoying when they do not take no for an answer. I did not like about 5 of them gathering around my bed and not moving. I found the best way to not get hassled was to wear sunglasses and a hat and pretend they did not exist.  It's a pity there are so many wild dogs roaming around too.  I know some of them may be rabid, which made me fear for my children's life - literally.  But they just poo on the beach and no one clears it ( or any other litter up).  I would have happily paid the seller's to pick up the poo and tidy the beach, instead of trying to sell me tat. The bars and restaurants along that road are ok, but nothing special."
lkpoli,"Singapore, Singapore",Jul 2013,"It's crowded long beach with many seas activity!You can get most of the top notch restaurant on the beach, having your cocktails or meal with the great sea view!"
ABAAJacobs,CPT-South Africa,Jun 2013,"there are always people.It is very busy and lost of hustle and bustle.There are shops and restaurants on the main road opposite the beach.There are always people wanting to sell you something,or braid your hair, or give you a massage etc.A little pricey with the goods they try to sell.Great hotels on the strip."
KayvD,"Perth, Australia",Jul 2013,"What better way to end a day than sipping half price cocktails, sitting in bean bags, watching the sunset and listening to the waves. Make the effort, it's bliss."
breadlovesbutter,"London, England, United Kingdom",Dec 2012,"Whenever I visit my friends in Bali we use Double six as a meeting point. The cafe's along the front perfect to sit after your morning dog walk, or after a day at the beautiful beach. Have your nails done whilst your sunbathing from one of the local girls (help them to survive!). Sometimes the beach vendors can be annoying so it's good to know how to say NO!! or Suda (If spelt correctly means ""already""). Great place to people watch and if you're lucky enough to be there on a Sunday to watch the sun come down you will also experience the locals coming out to play football or just hang out with their children and friends relaxing - This is a wonderful people watching area."
Missykatz,"Pismo Beach, CA",Sep 2012,"Had fun surfing and relaxing, but it is a beach full of people and vendors.  Not a quiet private beach by any stretch."
cheung w,"Seoul, South Korea",Jul 2013,"In addition to learning to play surf here, you can also enjoy the beach atmosphere while enjoying dinner. Because in this area that provides many restaurant for dinner."
SenyumDunia,"Brussels, Belgium",Jun 2013,"In Bali, we have several address that we keep. Double Six area is definitely one of them. A street full of range of restaurants and cafes are ready to welcome you. "
PatBintang,"Lanzarote, Spain",Jul 2013,Years ago the beach was quite clean down here but now the sand got more and more grey. The little creeks flowing through the beach from inland with the invested stinking water makes it even worth. Water quality must be really bad with brown foam on the surface where the creeks hit the ocean. Shame for Bali and lot's to clean up.
Katya R,Arusha,May 2013,"I was hoping my husband can learn to surf there, as I remember it being nicer than Kuta, and quite fun with all the little cafes and not overcrowded. The parking personnel asked for 2$ per hour parking fee, we went out of the car and were hit by the smell of sewage running into the sea, there pedestrian walk was filled with tourists, and coming out on the beach we just saw mile and miles of sun beds with umbrellas, and herds of hustlers selling you everything from sarongs, cheap bracelets and massage. We spent 5 minutes there and ran away. We ended up learning to surf on a lovely beach next to OM restaurant in Canggu and had a great time."
travelexpert w,"Tokyo, Japan",Jun 2013,"Very nice beach in Bali, there are lots of things to do, surfing, soccer, tanning, sunset. will be back"
Steve Herman,"Alexandria, VA",Jun 2013,Nice surf and sand but can become very crowded and the roaming touts are almost as annoying as on beaches south (Kuta and Legian). 
Magdala79,"Singapore, Singapore",Jun 2013,Quiet beach with many unique beach cafes. Pretty quiet even for the weekend. Beach is clean too. Only downside is the ladies who would offer their services to you. Remember to bargain the prices. Check out the prices in their massage parlour before hitting the beach... 
Eat1Drink2Travel3,"London, UK",Jun 2013,"Double six is bang in the middle of Kuta and Seminyak and a better beach than either for a number of reasons. It is more relaxed than Kuta but livelier than the end of Seminyak which is just a backyard of 5 star hotels. Th beach shacks provide sun beds, beer and great satay. What else could you want? Oh, some shallow water bathing could be nice, but it's all big waves. So bring your shades and enjoy watching the surfers dance on the waves."
cindychng77,Singapore,Jun 2013,"Am an amateur surfer, and Double Six beach, although popular, is not too crowded that I cant get on a surf. I usually rent the board from Andy's beach near the Lanai entrance and spend the day on the deck chair sipping Bintangs and catching some sun and surf - definitely a great way to relax! Food around the area is only so-so but the chicken wings at Lanai are good!"
Fio ng,"Hong Kong, China",Jun 2013,I like the fine sand and the long coastline. We took some great pictures there. The beach is not as crowded as Kuta beach.
whitstar,"Alexandra Headland, Australia",May 2013,"Look it's Bali, I know, but when I go to the beach, I like to relax. You just can't here. You are constantly, and I mean all the time, bothered by the street sellers who do not take a polite no for an answer. One sat down on my sun lounge trying to convince me to buy a pirate kite. The only way we could get some peace was to pretend we were asleep and that still didnt stop them. Witnessed a few dogs doing number twos in the ocean. Apart from that, cheap sunbeds, cold beers and awesome waves. Enjoyed the soccer match, except when the ball hit me on the head when I was asleep :)"
dekanggit,"Surabaya, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"My favorite place to do daily sport like jogging, volley beach, sunbathing, learn to surf, etc. The beach and sands was almost same with Kuta. But double six beach more quiet. Beside doing some sports, people also enjoying party on beach, chillin with their pets, enjoy the sunset, etc. But must be carefully beacuse I had bad experience. It was two dogs in double six run down for me when I was jogging."
Jayson C,"Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia",May 2013,"Cool Beach, Food's are available. the chairs cost 30000IDR, cant really swim our far as the guards will warn."
WiestGabi,"Florianopolis, SC",May 2013,"The beach itself is like Kuta, grey sand and grey sea, but the beach clubs are the highlight of the place. It has a lot of them, very cozy and with a really nice chilling out area. The drinks a very expensive but it worths to have a drink to see the sunset."
Lorraine P,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2013,Loved the small fee to have the use of a large sunbed and umbrella for the day!  In the afternoon a local soccer match was set up and was also enjoyed by the spectators!  Sunsets are unbelievably beautiful and seem to last for ever.  Vendors are persistent but one can't help liking them and even be-friending several.
stephanieosigli,"Melbourne, Australia",Apr 2013,loved the beach for just a small price of $3 AUD you can rent a banana lounge and be serviced cold drinks but the lovely beach.other then people hassling you to buy things was overall relaxing!
J0insing,"Medstead, UK",Apr 2013,"The Good:It's Bali!  The sea is warm, the sun is shining, the surf is fantastic, sunsets are epic, the loungers and umbrellas are cheap(ish), there are endless ladies to massage your back or do things to your hands and feet, the beer is cold.  Beachboys are keen to teach you to surf or just to hire you some boards - and everyone is happy and having a great time.  The beach bars come out at night with beanbags to relax on and watch the sunset - whats not to like?The Bad:Well - there ARE a few things not to like...1) Some days, the smell of sewage is strong in some parts of the beach.  That's a bit alarming given how much of the water goes up your nose, in your mouth, if you are as bad at surfing as I am2) Along with the smell, there was a suspicious looking brown scummy foam in some areas of the beach3) Two days of our stay, there was virtually no safe swimming area due to the size of the waves/rip.  The small area that was available was, you guessed it, right in the brown scummy foamy area"
mlock2000,"Tacoma, WA",Apr 2013,double six was the first beach we went to during our stay in Bali. it was a short taxi ride from where we were staying in Seminyak. upon arriving we notices the sewage smell right away. it was not goody. we walked as far as we could down the beach away from the smell. it was easy and cheap to find chairs. i even rented a boogie board for 3 bucks. the waves were amazing and we had plenty of fun! its not the cleanest beach along this coast but for one day it wasnt bad. there are little cafes and restaurants all around and some good shopping too!
1NZfamilyof4,"Christchurch, New Zealand",Nov 2012,"If you want to be in the heart of the action, see, hear and smell the epic waves of Bali this is the place!  It is full to the brim of life and love!  I love the fruit lady!  I love the beach chairs! I love everything about this place! If you only have a few days in Bali aim for here!!"
FEbulous,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Feb 2013,really crowded but I'm enjoy with that. I've seen beautiful sunset from this place. I visited this place with friends and enjoy some drink while see the sunset... pretty good !!
AngelinaK656,"Hong Kong, China",Apr 2013,"The beach was very nice to spend time with family. After the activity on the beach we can enjoy local cuisine to foreign countries. And at midnight, we are also able to simply drink while meeting colleagues, because in this place many cafe / pub until closing late at night."
583RS,"Tokyo, Japan",Mar 2013,"I found this beach to be moderately dirty - lots of trash around.  Surf is great - but wouldn't visit again.  Shopping around it is good, though"
Jamie,"South Australia, Australia",Mar 2013,"Loved just walking up the beach and grabbing a cold beer and beanbag, watching the locals surf, play football, volleyball and relax."
Mylene A,"Montreal, Canada",Mar 2013,If you love surfing and amazing sunset ... this is the place!Love it! The beach is clean and somehow very quiet.Sparkle by small lovely bars ... perfect for the apero for the sunsets!
hmpbpd,"Kerobokan, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Double Six beach is a Seminyak Staple. It's filthy during wet season (January and February) but the fine sand and flat surface make it perfect for exercise. It's particularly smelly at the end of Jalan Double 6 where the river dumps into the ocean. But the sand is fine and nice on the feet.With this and all other Bali beaches, keep your expectations realistic and you will have a great time. "
kormensandiego,"Manila, Philippines",Mar 2013,"Legian Beach, where Double Six Beach is, is actually a middle point between Kuta Beach and Seminyak Beach.  Double Six is just near the edge of Legian and start of Seminyak.In terms of crowd, you can see less of a crowd here than Kuta Beach, although you can still see lots of umbrella lounges for you to sit and enjoy the beach.  There are quite a number of surf schools here, so you can see some beginners trying to learn to surf.  This area is definitely not for swimming as the waves are strong.  But it's a nice place to stroll around the beach and hear the waves.There are some warungs around the area too, where you can get some food.  And there are a couple of bars just off the street parallel to the beach, if you dig the night life.You can see locals selling their wares, but they are not pushy as I've read about.  They sell jewelries, watches, kites.  The kites were actually quite nice and intricate, I saw one they were flying which was a pirate ship with many sails.  Actually I was just walking along, they offered 200,000 at first then even without any reaction from me except a smile, they lowered it to 100,000.  I figured I could get it for 50,000 if I haggled, haha!  But I didn't intend to buy it since it was too difficult to bring home anyway.The sand is ok, but it's brown.  There are also some garbage along the beach, plus patches of them along the sides, which is really a waste of the beauty of the beach.  I don't mind the brown/black sand as long as the beach is clean.  My friend told me Kuta Beach is even worse.In the evening, you can see a lot of local folks who have come to enjoy the beach.I was excited to see the sunset, unfortunately, it was raining that day, so I missed it.  Instead, I had a walk under the rain with my umbrella on the pathway just parallel to the beach, which was also nice ;-)"
Angan A,"Denpasar, Indonesia",Jan 2013,"Two and three years ago, this beach still offered a peaceful ambience, as not really much hotel were built. Compare to this year, that we found it hard to find car park though you have to pay for parking retribution. Food seller is not much like in Sanur. Unless you bring more money, better eat in Goodys or some resto besides it."
James Q,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Mar 2013,"Beach is great, just dont go in the ocean! Very visible sewage / oil in the water. Lots of litter; paper, cups, bags, etc floating in the water and washing ashore. A real shame. Bali must clean up its act!"
Guillaume P,"Singapore, Singapore",Feb 2013,"This beach is covered of plastic bags on the beach and in the water. It is really disgusting. And if you date to go in the water, you will feel some tiny little things (cant see, they are too small) biting your skin. You got 2 sewage areas on the beach too, which doesnt help... Just avoid the place!"
Lil-Bali-Traveller,"Nusa Dua, Indonesia",Nov 2012,Great sunset and sunbathing placeLove this beach and the sceneryWe always bring our client here also to enjoy the horse riding and to visit our favorite cafe
Clarissa11_11,"Sydney Olympic Park, Australia",Mar 2013,"The water was lovely, but the beaches and the rubbish is a real turnoff. I've been to many other third world countries, they have always appeared to keep the tourist areas somewhat clean, but not in Bali, disappointing."
SandeepBalaji,"Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum), India",Jan 2013,A bit dirty but then thats the case with a lot of Kuta and Seminiyak with the tourist explosion. Nice beach to chill and watch the sunset.
jessica m,"New York City, NY",Jan 2013,"I remember that was a nice beach near my hotel when I went to seminyak, Bali. Very nice sunset when I enjoy it in that beach. Nice bar too around there. Good place for enjoy the sunset"
Adhy76,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Feb 2013,It is a great beach to walk and play around. There are several cafes near the beach to hangout and see sunset from there.
Latitudes-Longitudes,"San Francisco, California",Jan 2013,"I love going for sunset drinks to the bars on this area, the black sand and colorful cushions create a nice atmosphere.Is a pitty there is so much trash floating ashore from the currents coming from other islands.This ruins the view and experience of a ""romantic"" moment.Still, nice to go for a drink the rest of the year."
Lina Jasin,"Jakarta, Indonesia",Nov 2012,"The best place to hang out and go crazy a bit, get drunk and dance, if you feel hot then go to the beach for oxygen then comeback, go with friends or your love one, its fun to release our stress after too much works"
Bhavan45,"Perth, Australia",Dec 2012,Went down here late afternoons for a beer. Lots of hawkers who you learn to ignore or joke with. Good if you have a family as the kids can play. Pleasant walk back to Seminyak.
