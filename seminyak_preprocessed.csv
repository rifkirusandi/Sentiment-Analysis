Sep 2019,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha.",arrrrh one place didnt list agenda plan trip particularly people spend time tan crisp write completely bit harsh wish make exception still manage couple hour toe dip coolness sea watch listen great ocean wave tingle u excitement almost sweep u case sand stress 17 hour flight blissseminyak 10 minute walk alea hotel route straight cut residential area dot quaint villa tropical greenery temperature didnt hold back midday sun worshipper crawl back luxury hotel air con u great almost local vendor try delight u war friendly smiley people polite thank will suffice enjoyed moment peace calmness watch swirls wave come cool roast foot blaze heat sand salty sea air catch odd glimpse surfer conquer wave add fun sun spot crab pop pocket sand run sea well camouflaged longer spent walk gaze vastness ocean mindset touch sens one dream paradise make feel alive regain sanity clean line palm tree gently sway breeze sand soft youll leave picture postcard memory footprints others follow bar restaurant set late brunch park cafe people watch take photo end leisurely stroll bohemian cafe look one big tropical fruit cocktail invite cosy colourful bean bag low level table signpost funky quote picture relaxation peace love cafe overlook ocean feed water enjoy ambience guess fabulous party vibe even mover shaker enjoy beer watch amazing sunset recommendation definitely go press escape youll transport world calmness ride wave let free spirit run wild therapy cheap personally ill put future trip whats likeindu versha,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.609, 'pos': 0.323, 'compound': 0.9975}",0.9975,1

Aug 2019,The Money Changers here scam you with posting high rates outside their doors. When you give them a  $100 Bill they will keep it on top of the counter and pile up the Indonesian Rupiah bills on the counter. The conversion is approximately 1.4 million and change. This they will convert in 50000 Rupiah notes which will amount to between 28 to 30 notes per $100. They will then pick up the notes to hand you the pile and will CRAFTILY PULL OUT a large chunk of the notes. The bigger the amount the easier it is for them to pull out more notes. An unsuspecting traveler will put the money in their purse or pocket and later realise that they were scammed. In our case we changed $500 and our due amount was 7.35 million. They handed us a shade over 5 million. We realised this when we arrived at the hotel.

Jun 2019,"….This 5km section of the continuous KUTA-CANGGU beach strip rates AVERAGE by Bali mainland standards but BELOW AVERAGE by world standards….You don’t come to Bali for great beaches...correction, you may come to Bali to sit on the beach in tropical conditions when it’s  freezing at home, sipping a cut price cocktail yada…..but the beach will not be whelming…. not on the mainland at least.I’m a beach blogger with over 3 million hits – get back to BALI annually and always make a point of cycling/walking SEMINYAK – stayed inland there a few years back. I’ve visited thousands of beaches over 40 years and would not rate BALI MAINLAND’s best in my top 500. Offshore LEMBONGAN may just scrape in. IN CONTRAST gorgeous and spectacular ARTUH BEACH** (offshore NUSA PENIDA) would make my top 10. Maybe even top 3.But hey, if you seldom see a beach, you may think SEMINYAK the ants pants. As FERRIS BUELLER’S bookie never said: “Sure beats a sand-pit in south SPRINGFIELD”.See. what we have here is a long strip of sand where it’s easy to find a fairly deserted section - or to sit with a crowd on rather swish sun-loubge/umbrella combinations if that’s your jam. These more crowded parts are outside the bigger resorts (all sized high-end places back the beach along here) + where roads from inland (more accommodation) access the sand.There’s a gradual change heading north. South end near the big DOUBLE SIX** resort has sand similar to KUTA-LEGIAN: kinda tan-grey (rather than the gorgeous white stuff when I first visited in ‘75). Heading north it darkens somewhat – although never reaching the light black of CANGGU BCH immediately north. Most areas are quite wide but it does narrow in sections.Activity changes too – the first 400m is a continuation of the crowded KUTA-LEGIAN scene. 3 or 4 beach bars with cushions/small tables on the sand are a real scene around sunset. Moving north it becomes quieter with gaps between crowded areas. The far north can be very uncrowded.TIPS – those beach clubs: maybe 4 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw one with at least 1000 people on the sand!!!! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems high end. Dozens of all budget places within a 10 min stroll inland.- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.- wet season is not the best time to visit – lotsa rubbish and dirty storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here (hotels/airlines offer great low season packages) – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions.

If I had children there is no way I would allow them to swim in those waters.  The first couple weeks the beaches were much the same, some days much worse than others. There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions.

Dec 2018,"(written after 1st day, update after that)After starting our Bali trip in Sanur, where the beach was clean, with zero plastic and crystal, still waters, the Seminyak beach DUMP was a shocking experience!A very nice, classic monumental beach, tens of kilometres long, and more than 50 m wide, with this solid, easy-walking sand, BUT FULL OF PLASTIC! Both the beach and the water as well. And small rivers bring sewage, nauseous.Could not swim at all, so ugly! Fortunately we had such a nice villa, we could stay there.About this disaster we discussed for long with our villa manager. Well, he said that the beach is not such all the time, but twice a year. Then there is certain wind, that now started blowin 4 days ago, and it brings a lot of wood pieces and plastic ashore.Usually lasts around a week. Good thing to see, compared to eg. Thailand, was to see, that there was an army of government paid workers cleaning beach, and trucks driving the waste away. On our 1 hour walk I think we saw more than hundred workers on a 2km strip of beach.Still, it will last days for the sea to vommit all the carbage to the land for them to pick up.I asked where is the litter from, and the manager told us, it is from ther rivers, namely Balis own rivers, not coming further away. He said there is a lot going on in Bali to tackle the issue, but the change is slow, and presumed it take at least one lifetime. They do realize that tourists won't come if it is not clean!And, maybe tourists have already started to shun Bali as both in Sanur and in Seminyak it was really quite, the restaurants empty all night etc.?They are banning the plastic straws already, which is a start, but most of the plastic litter seems to be smaller than plastic bags, these everyday wrappers for food.

Apr 2017,I didn't like Semiyak beach at all. Went there once. In fact Semiyak was not what I was expecting. It's really busy with lots of traffic taxi drivers constantly hooting. I just didn't feel relaxed. It felt like we where in a hot noisy city full of designer shops and to find a nice beach you had to go to a beach club with a minimum spend. We left after a few days even though we had a hotel. We also had a lot of trouble getting cash out. Make sure when using cash machine you press checking account as it has 3 options and you press the wrong one and you don't get any money. A lot of the machines kept running out of money. Everyone from all over the world had trouble getting cash. Always get a blue bird taxi as they have to use the meter and they are much cheaper. You can download the app before you come called my bluebird taxi. I went all over Bali and I found the people very friendly everywhere. And if you learn thank you and a bit of Balinese they love it. Oh if you like wine ( like me) bring it from duty free as it's expensive everywhere in Bali. Semiyak is not the place for cheap shopping either. It's all expensive cloths shops and we found prices cheaper in Kuta. ,didnt semiyak go fact semiyak expect really busy lot traffic taxi driver constantly hoot didnt feel relax felt hot noisy city full designer shop find nice go club minimum spend leave day even though hotel lot trouble get cash make sure use cash machine press check account 3 option press wrong one dont money lot machine keep run money everyone world trouble get cash always blue bird taxi use meter much cheap download app come call bluebird taxi go bali find people friendly everywhere learn thank bit balinese love oh wine bring duty free expensive everywhere bali semiyak place cheap shopping either expensive cloth shop found price cheap kuta,"{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.749, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.7575}",0.7575,1

Apr 2017,"This is for anyone visiting,  or thinking of visiting Seminyak this year (2017).These are only our own opinions based on our recent holiday there. GETTING THERE: Most people will arrive via Denpasar Airport, and from the arrivals hall you'll enter a very busy area with hordes of people holding name boards,  and even more taxi drivers vying for your business.  My advice here is to ensure that you've pre-booked a taxi through your hotel. Your (c30 min) journey to your Seminyak hotel will then be easier and probably less expensive.  Our pre-booked taxi cost £15.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok, Denpasar and environs is never going to win any beauty awards, if you're familiar with the Far East then the ramshackle set-up, the huge volume of crazily driven scooters, and the antithesis to Western order won't come as a shock, but if Bali is your first time east of the Mediterranean then be patient and stick with it.  Seminyak has been designed for enjoyment whilst Denpasar is a capital city with few reasons to linger.Seminyak is quite compact and this review only encompasses this area and not Kuta. The vast majority of the accommodation in town is either beach facing,  or a short walk from the beach.HOTELS: Whilst we can only comment specifically on one, the excellent Taum Resort, we saw enough of the others during our stay to build a very favourable opinion on standards,  most were 4* and quite a few the vaunted 5* quality, and they looked every inch comparable with the best beach hotels in Europe. We saw a number of very smart beachfront hotels with sun decks, pools and lovingly manicured gardens, where the almost daily stunning sunsets could be enjoyed in blissful surroundings. NIGHTLIFE : This is where Seminyak scores highly.  It's set-up for people who like to enjoy life once the sun goes down - but that said,  it's not trying to be an Ibiza. We felt that the beating heart of Seminyak was given over to couples,  irrespective of age (we're 40's and 50's), and testimony to this were the range of other couples that we met during our stay; the vast majority being Australian  (3 hrs flight from Perth for example ). Lots of 'gap year' youngsters and 'Eat, Pray, Love' wannabe types looking for adventure or love (or both). They'd all gravitated to the right place, heaps of great bars and restaurants and enough high-end nightspots to please every taste,  budget and preference,  most people will have heard of Potato Head and Ku De Ta etc, they're very good as you'd expect, but look beyond them and the supporting cast will enthrall you and your money will go a long way. Although just examples and exchange rates will fluctuate, you'll find most bars trying to lure you in with 2-1 cocktails or 2-1 Happy Hour deals for around (UK) £1.50 for the beer (Bintang is the excellent local beer) and £3 for the cocktails,  compare this to London prices and you'll be in the slightly unusual position of feeling mildly wealthy.  Eating out bears similar fruit and we enjoyed some brilliant food in extremely atmospheric restaurants for Wetherspoons type prices! For a couple of personal recommendations try La Laguna, Ginger Moon, Batik, Grocer & Grind,  but there are nany more as good.  In short then, tons of choice,  fantastic service wherever you go,  and very kind on your pocket  (have you booked yet?).SAFETY: This one comes in two parts.  If you're reading this and you're an adult,  or going with other adults,  then this will be the safest place you've ever been unless you drink too much,  if you get drunk then at some point you're likely to fall foul of the 2-wheeled 24/7 carnage that is the half a billion scooters that compete for space on the narrow Seminyak streets, these things are literally everywhere and at times the lunatic drivers (term used loosely ) will mount the kerb and use the footpath. Many of the scooters appear to be carrying at least 3 generations of the same family and they'll all have aboard items such as ladders, power saws, live animals and the sort of stuff we'd need a Qashqai to transport. We took photos of the aforementioned just because we figured the folks back home wouldn't believe us! Crossing the road in Bali would be classed as a dangerous sport in the Uk, but help is normally on hand courtesy of the ubiquitous security guards, who guard everything.  They all carry illuminated batons and make full use of the whistles that they also carry, if they spot that you're struggling to cross the road then they're out there in a jiffy to see you safely across.  Top boys.The pavements are hilarious in that one minute they're there,  and then the next minute they've either ended abruptly at a large chasm,  or a  set of neck height power lines (not kidding) ,  or....the pavement just reappears on the opposite side of the street. So, given the last point,  I'd implore any parents with babies,  toddlers,  or pre-teen children to take a holiday elsewhere,  because we saw so many anguished parents frantically trying to either control their kids next to the Nurbergring town roads,  or trying to stop enough of the wacky races participants in order to get to the other side,  hugely dangerous and quite disturbing to see. Bali is lovely but small children brought up with UK road sense are in peril here.Like I said earlier, sensible adults will have no issues here. BEACH : This was a shock to us. When we booked our holiday we of course Googled Bali (Seminyak) beach images,  and feasted our eyes on the stunning shots. In reality there are times when the long Seminyak Beach is quite the opposite. In the wet season it rains regularly and when it does the stuff cones down in torrents,  add to this the generally observed habit of throwing most litter into the gutter,  then you'll quickly realise that all of the litter is quickly washed into surface water culverts that themselves wash into the small rivers that flow through the town. These then run straight into the sea,  and the tide deposits the whole lot on the tide line early doors the next morning! ! Take a beach stroll on the morning after one of the regular evening thunderstorms and you'll see what I mean.; absolutely shocking mess and not safe for walking on as you can imagine.  The Balinese seem to employ a small army of people (many wearing face masks and PPE) plus tractors to try and make good this mess every day.  When this has been done then large swathes of the beach do justice to the brochure images,  but just be aware that at times the beach can be quite awful and there has to be some effort made to try and improve the littering situation which I have to say is more down to the locals,  than the visitors!TAXIS: Worthy of its own section,  the town is chock full of taxis and this whirring convoy just seems to endlessly circulate around the centre (AKA Seminyak Square) looking for anyone 'walking '. We deduced that when Balinese taxi drivers take their training course their first instruction is the assumption that someone walking is in dire need of a fare-paying lift! From the second you creep beyond the wall of your hotel EVERY taxi driver will hit his horn and slow down,  many will stop and wind down their window and wait for you to agree that 'yes....you can't possibly walk 100 metres to the beach / bar / shop, and that you need a lift'.  The trick is to either smile and carry on walking, or just ignore them. Both methods work equally well but the good news is that these guys aren't the least bit pushy or aggressive. You get used to the patter and we assume that they get used to just driving around all day.That said, be advised of the ongoing scams. The ONLY officially licensed taxis are Blue Bird. That doesn't help you with recognition because in Bali EVERY taxi is blue and the same model  (Toyota ) as the official ones!  Also many of the unlicensed taxis have the name 'Blue XXXX' that look almost identical to the pucker version. The difference being that if you ride in a dodgy taxi then the driver will either say ""meter not working"", or when you arrive at your destination,  he will say ""no change"". The latter is a patent lie of course, and if you enter a taxi with ""broken meter "" then get straight out. We of course fell fowl of both on day one, but a very helpful 'official ' Blue Bird driver apprised us of the dark side of Seminyak taxis on day two,  citing that unlicensed drivers face fines if caught with dodgy meters or if they're discourteous to customers.  In summary we found the whole taxi topic amusing,  and I'd also add that almost every driver  stopped or slowed down if they saw that we wanted to cross the street.In terms of fares. From our hotel to either the beach or Seminyak Square,  both a 30 min walk,  we'd pay the minimum evening fare of IDR 30.OOO. Which worked out at £2 at the March exchange rate of IDR 16000 to £1. MONEY: I've alluded to the generally very agreeable cost of eating and drinking out, taxis I've also said are cheap,  and with a total absence of other means of public transport you might want to engage your hotel in finding a locally recommended driver. We hired a friendly driver who took us all around the island for £30 per day, try doing that in the UK and you'll be adding another '0', fantastic value and all of the drivers speak good English  (as do almost all Balinese ).There are numerous ATM's dotted around Seminyak and my wife and I used different ATM's with our respective banks and the exchange rates worked out at broadly the same as the exchange rates that we'd been given prior to setting off from the UK. If you're a single female traveller and are conscious of security with your cards / money then there are a couple of cash machines inside the new shopping mall in Seminyak Square, the latter housing some good shops,  but tons of better ones that aren't generic 'high street' around the town that are well worth a look.  THE PEOPLE : If you've been to Thailand then you'll be sitting there thinking that 'nobody is friendlier than the Thai's', I know you're thinking that because we thought so, too. But come here and you'll be truly in the presence of the nicest people on God's green Earth. We were humbled by their humility,  their values,  their sheer desire to make a difference to your day. The service we received in every single venue, bar, hotel, or even total strangers in the street was so genuine,  so wonderful,  that to not come back to Bali would be a crime. Come and see for yourself,  if you've been promising yourself  / husband / wife / partner to take a trip to Bali then go to your bank tomorrow,  or beg a wealthy relative for funds,  sell that useless artefact or trade-in the boat you never used,  and drag your weary body to this temple of soul salvation, I promise you that you will enjoy every moment and you'll return to our embittered crime -ridden soulless country a better person.SEMINYAK: Yes it's a fabulous destination.  It's not without its faults and I'd advocate it's not fit for young children or the infirm,  but if your mojo has lost its sparkle then this is the place to lift your spirits. Great hotels, great nightlife, and incredible people. WEATHER: There are two main seasons in Bali. Hot and wet and hot and dry. We came end of March which is towards the end of the wet season. We had rain almost every day but in the main the rain and thunderstorms came late afternoon or during the night. When it rains it comes down in torrents but the temperature doesn't drop,  meaning it gets very humid. When the sun comes out it's blistering hot and most days the mercury will climb up to 32c (90f in old money ) and often beyond. The actual temperature feels hotter so the 'real feel' in the daytime is more like 40c (104f). Bear that in mind if you're fair skinned!  At night the thermometer rarely dips below 25c (77f) so you'll not need to bring outer layers here save for a rain mac. What disappointed me was the appalling lack of weather forecast detail available online in the lead up to our holiday.  The BBC didn't feature a single location on Bali,  others just gave a  generic 'cut and paste ' tropics forecast, and the go-to Wunderground  (Weather Underground ) gave pessimistic forecasts which simply stated ""cloud,  frequent thunderstorms "" for most of the days we were there,  and whilst 'yes' we did get some cloud and some storms,  the latter's forecasts made no mention of the 5-6 hours of blazing sunshine that we got each day. Only one day out of 12 was 'bang on' their prediction. So I'm saying don't take too much notice of the forecasts before you come out here,  they're not accurate enough!  Have a great time.

Apr 2017,"And you get all sorts of life on Seminyak Beach. It all depends on what you want from a beach as to whether or not it is a good place to go.The problem here is that for every good point, there is an opposite and vice versa. Firstly this is a huge beach. At low tide very wide and it is accessed by a few gaps in the rows of restaurants, cafes and bars which line the coast usually abutting the access roads . You will pay to park, even a motorbike nearby but then it will be relatively safe. The alternative is that you will get free parking in an isolated area and have you bike pinched or complain that there are no facilities.This is an excellent beach for running especially by the water and if you go fast enough you wont be bothered by hawkers. However if you stay still for five minutes they will be all over you. Especially if you show any interest in the sunglasses, watch or Ken Holm wok that they are selling. This is truly an international problem now but they have to earn a living and they generally move on if politely addressed. The problem is that there are so many of them there is always another one to follow. Alternatively, you may just want your hair braiding, sir, or your nails varnishing whilst sitting on a beach. To be honest, you can get pretty much anything you want on Seminyak Beach except probably any peace.The water is warm but a lot of sand suspension as it is shallow. It can also be windy and because of its undisturbed length,windy and disorientating. Look out for the flags for safe swimming. A truly high point is to watch the sunset especially with a cold beer at one of the bars or walking along the sand with your partner. If my memory serves me correctly though.

What I saw instead was a beach full of trash, stray dogs running around, some brown water in the beach and some red flags that's telling you not to go into the water. Trash. That's what I felt as I was walking around in the water and on the beach. There are lot of TRASH. I couldn't stand in the water for a minute without some kind of trash touching my feet. Wrappers, Cloths, or whatever. Trash. Now I come from Los Angeles where there are a lot of people that go in the water and has commercial businesses all around. Even LA beaches felt it was cleaner and more sanitary than here. I couldn't believe all the amount of trash floating in the water and debris on the beach. I thought this was supposed to be a paradise, instead it felt like where all the trash ended up. Granted some of them could be from Bali and some of them could be from elsewhere just washing up here. Regardless, it felt dirty just standing in the water with the damn trash touching my feet every 10 seconds or so!I saw some brown water and thought it was weird that the water was so brown. Not all parts but some parts. I asked around why the water was brown and no one knew. Also there were red flags all around and when I asked around, people were saying because the wind was strong and that you could get sucked out to the ocean due to fast & strong current. Also there are apparently whirlpools that will suck you in. That's a scary thought. I've also seen some stray dogs running around. One time I saw a pack of 5 dogs all playing with each other on the beach. Sure that sounds cute except when you come to realize that some of these dogs could have rabies, probably had no owners, and that they were playing in the beach where people were. I'm sure the dogs don't think about where to pee and poop. I'm from USA where there are regulations against dogs on the beach due to them crapping and peeing which contaminates the water. In Seminyak I've seen a lot of stray dogs around which didn't help the feeling I got about the hygiene and cleanliness of the water. The water was very warm. That was one plus about the beach.

Great for walking, surfing (body, bogey board and just surfboard), and taking amazing photographs of Bali Beach Life and, of course, beautiful sunsets. It is also lined with some amazing places to eat and sleep (see my other reviews for Seminyak) which are perfect for a drink, a meal or just  enjoying the almost nightly beautiful sunsets. This would be a five star beach except for two, or three caveats. One is that alot of people have dogs in Bali and bring them on the beach. Which means if you like to walk barefoot on the beach, like I do, then you need to pay extra attention that you don't step into a fresh dog droppings. Two is that at various points along the beach there are effluents from various parts of town. This is raw sewage. I either walk out in the surf to cross them or just turn around and walk the other way. Needless to say, you don't want to be swimming directly offshore, or down current unless you've had all your shots!;) Thirdly is a new hazard which I only noticed on this last trip, which is broken shards of glass from beer bottles. The ones I spotted at low tide were in the shallow water and constantly being covered and uncovered by the trailing surf. I made a mental note to myself to pack my white water sandals next time I come. It's really a shame that such a beautiful natural spot as Seminyak is being polluted in this way. But while the above hazards do detract from the water and beach activities they do not affect the absolutely amazing sunsets.

Jan 2017,"I was in Seminyak in the winter 2014 and was already shocked then by the incredibly dirty beach and ocean. The sewage is running straight into the sea on various points along the beach. This has not changed at all from my first visit. The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!! Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror. We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time.

The beach is fantastic, I love going to La Plancha and the other beach bars to get a mid afternoon drink in between splashing in the surf and relaxing on one of the many recliners.

Then, I stay at a nearby hotel so I can quickly shower, change and get to one of Seminyak's many gorgeous delicious restaurants. It's easy enough to rent a motorcycle or hire a driver to go up and around the island on longer days to view the many temples, rice terraces and other more Balinese favourite spots. I will warn that our fellow Australian neighbours tend to get a bit crazy and exhibit at times an appalling lack of respect for the local people and other tourists. But, hey, there are many Aussies that are super charming and delightful... I love you guys. Just reign in the trashy types a bit better... frankly, it's embarrassing. We all want to have a good time in this friendly, gorgeous place... it doesn't require falling on the ground or vomiting in the bushes to make that possible. Our Indonesian hosts would appreciate your thoughtfulness as well.Do keep in mind that Seminyak is in the trio of townships along western Bali that are most commercial and frequented by tourists.

Seminyak beach is covered in tiny pieces of plastic and polystyrene which ends up in marine life's stomachs. Which is wonderful for the local people who rely on fish for protein. We spoke to many fishermen who are outraged by this horrendous rubbish problem in the ocean. Playing in the waves you feel rubbish brushing past you and it's just not pleasant. One day we didn't even go in the sea as there was so much rubbish! There needs to be recycling facilities that are readily available and free for hotels in Seminyak and all of Bali. We saw local people raiding bins outside hotels for plastic bottles and cans, surely these could at least be left out for them!? We couldn't even find anywhere in Seminyak where we could refill our plastic water bottles. Human waste is also released into the sea all around Bali via the sewer pipes that go down the beach and out to sea.Also watch the current at Seminyak beach. Great for us surfing and body boarding but we also saw three separate occasions where life guards had to rescue people who had been taken out by the current. Great fun in the big waves but just be careful.

They treat us so well we return to the magnificent  The Legian Hotel Bali as often as we can. The really good fun is once every stay I get into a bartering discussion buying goods from them. At the conclusion I pay the agreed price and give them back the goods and tell them to sell them to someone else. Their well being is much more important to my wife and I than the goods or the money.

The same chap who sells you the lounge can also supply you with well-priced cold drinks (coke, beer, coconuts etc).Note for foreign tourists - you can't sit on the lounges for free 'just for 10 minutes', as we saw several tourists try to do, including a couple of female Australians who wanted to change their toddler's nappy (!). The lounges are rented, it's how those guys make their living - if they let everyone sit on the lounges 'just for 10 minutes', they wouldn't make a rupiah.There are some sellers trawling the beach, but they're not too pushy, and perhaps not as numerous as in Kuta and Legian.You can just sit on your towels on the beach for free, but you might get burnt that way.There are numerous beach shacks south of Jl. Camplung Tanduk, they are cheap and good for burgers, juices and beer.Surf is good for boogie boarding and body surfing.

Jul 2015,"I consider myself a bit of an expert on nice beaches.  Seminyak is a great beach with nice sand.  It's a very wide beach, and when the tide is out it can be 200 meters or more wide.  There is no drop off, and the bottom is sandy.  Great for surfing, body surfing and swimming.  There are some rip currents when the surf is big, so pay attention to the flags.  You can also rent chairs with umbrellas if you don't want to lay in the sand.  Plenty of restaurants on the beach, and great for sunsets.  I'd give it 5 stars,but…  there is a definite problem with the amount of plastic garbage that washes up on the beach.  And here's my suggestion - the government should take a portion of the entry tax they collect and hire people to pick up the beach.  People work for very little in Bali.  Start on one end and just pick it up.  With tourism seemingly the main industry in Bali, I'm surprised they don't do a better job.  And the hawkers can become a bit much as well.  I mean, I don't really need a painting of an elephant or buddah.

Seminyak, Legian and other beaches along this coastline are great for surfing, body/boogie boarding, and watching the sunset. They are not good for swimming or snorkeling as the waves are too big. If you walk along the stretches of private beaches (exclusive to resort guests), they are likely to be clean, but go into the water and you'll likely spot some garbage (plastic bags, paper towel, piece of stick, anything you can think of) floating around. As far as the area itself, Seminyak is a hot spot, second busiest to Kuta with an older, slightly more sophisticated crowd. There are cute little shops, both modern and traditional restaurants, and bars with happy hour deals and live entertainment just about any night of the week. On the weekends (especially Saturday night), the place is a zoo. If you're looking for a little peace and quiet, you probably won't find it in Seminyak unless it's off-season and/or you're staying at a resort with a private beach.

If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourists come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. There is also polluted water that seriously smells like sewerage flowing into the ocean and kids play in it!! I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are still pristine paradise so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc. I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer. This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person. All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.

Mar 2014,"As lovely as the weather was in Bali last week, the one thing I just could not stay silent about is how dirty the beach was. There were rubbish that formed a tide line here on Seminyak, and also along Kuta. It was such an eye sore. And worse, true to its name, there were oil slicks coming in with the waves. Seminyak in bahasa means ""one oil"". I guess Bali really didnt want to disappoint. If you want the beach, go elsewhere. Heard Sanur is far better...or even Nusa Dua....or anywhere else, but...But if you dont want the beach, then why even go to Bali? I just had the misfortune of not doing enough research about the island. Probably deluded by the many glorified romantic tales - blame eat pray love for that! But if you seek to just chill and unwind, then, this island is ideal. And this part of Kuta (contrary to popular belief, Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is in reality ONE area) is the quieter portion. Food wise? For Asians, it's not really value for money at all. Drinks are rather pricey too. Shopping for the ladies? Sure...Bangkok's cheaper. Heck, even KL is far cheaper. Nightlife? In Seminyak? They only have 2 options, apart from dinner. One is the high end restaurants-turn-club-after-dinner, the other...well, if you dont swing the other way, and do not like diva shows, then hail a cab and hit Jalan Legian, Kuta instead.But the one thing I enjoyed Seminyak for was the hospitality at the hotel and restaurants I went to. But probably an advantage that I can speak Indonesian.",lovely weather bali last week one thing stay silent dirty rubbish form tide line seminyak along kuta eye sore bad true name oil slick come wave seminyak bahasa mean one oil guess bali really didnt want disappoint want go elsewhere heard sanur far betteror even nusa duaor anywhere butbut dont want even go bali misfortune enough research island probably delude many glorified romantic tale blame eat pray love seek chill unwind island ideal part kuta contrary popular belief seminyak legian kuta reality one area quieter portion food wise asian really value money drink rather pricey shop lady surebangkoks cheap heck even kl far cheap nightlife seminyak 2 option apart dinner one high end restaurantsturnclubafterdinner otherwell dont swing way diva show hail cab hit jalan legian kuta insteadbut one thing enjoy seminyak hospitality hotel restaurant go probably advantage speak indonesian,"{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.677, 'pos': 0.232, 'compound': 0.9759}",0.9759,1
