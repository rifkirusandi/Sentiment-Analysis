Apr 2017,"Canggu beach is of black sand and stretches for some distance. You will find surfers mostly from Europe and the United States being carefree and chasing waves. Naturally, you'll also find Australians due to the proximity. As you reach the beach at the end of Jl Pantai Batau Bolong, you will find bars, cafes and restaurants serving hungry tourists and surfers. There are also surf boards for hire. The main mode of transport to get here is by scooter which can be hired almost anywhere or taxi. It is also a great spot to watch the sun set or just pop on one of the sun lounges set up by locals with their little shacks that sell beers and soft drinks and food. The lounges are free if you purchase a beverage with them.

Jan 2017,Canggu Beach is a black sand volcanic beach which makes it look a little unattractive for us Australians used to white sand and sparkling blue seas. However I found it a really good place to hang out and have conversations with fellow travellers at various bars that line the sand. These range from wildly expensive (Western priced) complete with swimming pools and lovely lounging furniture through to cheap little warnings which offer bean bags under beach umbrellas. There was a bit of surf when I was there and its possible to hire boards. I am a little reluctant to swim in south Bali ocean because of poor  sewage and a big population but lots of people were taking the plunge. It was boisterous sea so be careful if you are a weak swimmer - lots of sandbanks and turbulence. Excellent for big beach walks.,canggu black sand volcanic make look little unattractive u australian use white sand sparkle blue sea find really good place hang conversation fellow traveller various bar line sand range wildly expensive western price complete swimming pool lovely lounge furniture cheap little warning offer bean bag umbrellas bit surf possible hire board little reluctant swim south bali ocean poor sewage big population lot people take plunge boisterous sea careful weak swimmer lot sandbank turbulence excellent big walk,"{'neg': 0.134, 'neu': 0.703, 'pos': 0.163, 'compound': 0.5679}",0.5679,positive

Jul 2018,Canggu beach is a popular but unattractive stretch of sand on Bali's east coast just north of Seminyak beach.  It is black sand and not at all well-kept.  There are also far too many people for it to be all that pleasant.  Stray dogs are also a pest.The most popular stretch of beach is that in front of the various warungs and bars perched above.  Row after row of cheap beach loungers with parasols are full of people during peak season.  With all the people come rubbish which is not looked after really at all as much of the beach is a mess.The mess is made worse by dogs.  Stray and owned dogs are on the beach and their produce is a hazard that needs to be looked out for.The beach itself is black sand which can be ok but here is not fine enough to be a pleasant experience.  The waves in this part of the world are moderate but even when it did not seem that blustery it was still not possible to enter the water as warning signs were posted.  Even wading in a few yards was prohibited.Hawkers were present but were not overly persistent.  They did seem to spend too longer loitering but were not a threat.Seeing as there are much nicer spots just south in Seminyak it is not entirely clear why so many flock to Canggu beach or why it is considered to be a better spot.

Jul 2019,"Canggu was one of favorite places in the whole world! I had read tons and tons of forums trying to figured out which beach town  I wanted to go to and finally decided on Canggu.  I could not imagine going anywhere else now!! It was the perfect place if you're a young professional looking for a bit of night life without the party scene.  Everywhere felt new, clean, and the perfect mix of boho/Balinese culture.  We stayed in an Air BnB right off the main drive but in a fairly quiet space and it was PERFECT.  Walking distance to the beach, Love Anchor, Crate Cafe, and any restaurant or happy hour you could desire.  We moved locations half way through our trip to another city and actually took a taxi back to Canggu on our last day because we just couldn't get enough!

We were followed all the way down the very long main road when I said I wouldn’t pay for the massively overpriced “local taxis” fees. A scooter literally followed us and threw us out of the Bluebird taxi that stopped for us! Simply because they expect tourists to pay more than locals and get quite aggressive when you don’t. Despite being a really great town and resort I would’ve go back for that reason alone. These thugs attitude marred what was otherwise a great two weeks in Bali. The people are generally really lovely which is why this aggressive behaviour came as such a surprise. The police or local businesses should really do something about this abuse of tourists.

Oct 2012,"We spent a day at Echo Beach, a short drive from Canggu, and an hour and a half from Ubud, where we were staying. The beach is not Bali's prettiest, nor its cleanest, but it does have decent surf for beginner to intermediate surfers, and is laid back enough to be enjoyable for a day trip. We had our 3 children, ages 7, 7, and 10, with us. They took a 2-hour lesson with the Canggu Surf School, which was well worth the money ($60 p.p. for 2 hours). The beach has a single alley with a few shops, and a handful of restaurants, so don't visit expecting the full-on, Bali tourist experience. In my opinion, this is a GOOD thing! The people who come here seem to be more relaxed than Kuta or Seminyak, and the lack of in-your-face commercialism is refreshing. I suspect the area was nicer a few years ago, before rampant development got underway. Right now, there's an enormous hotel going up, as well as a large number of apartments, and it detracts from the overall ""undiscovered"" vibe of the place. Probably has another year or so before it succumbs to the unzoned, unplanned development chaos that has subsumed a lot of Bali. Two unexpected high points: (1) The Echo Beach cafe, nearest to the temple, has a sensational BBQ every night. Worth staying past dark for! (2) If you like motorcycle/surf culture, the Deus Ex Machina Temple of Enthusiasm is just down the road.",spent day echo short drive canggu hour half ubud stay bali pretty cleanest decent surf beginner intermediate surfer lay back enough enjoyable day trip 3 child age 7 7 10 u take 2hour lesson canggu surf school well worth money 60 pp 2 hour single alley shop handful restaurant dont visit expect fullon bali tourist experience opinion good thing people come seem relaxed kuta seminyak lack inyourface commercialism refresh suspect area nicer year ago rampant development get underway right now theres enormous hotel go well large number apartment detract overall undiscovered vibe place probably another year succumbs unzoned unplanned development chaos subsume lot bali two unexpected high point 1 echo cafe near temple sensational bbq every night worth stay past dark 2 motorcyclesurf culture deus ex machina temple enthusiasm road,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.754, 'pos': 0.189, 'compound': 0.9442}",0.9442,positive

Mar 2013,"Legian Beach, where Double Six Beach is, is actually a middle point between Kuta Beach and Seminyak Beach.  Double Six is just near the edge of Legian and start of Seminyak.In terms of crowd, you can see less of a crowd here than Kuta Beach, although you can still see lots of umbrella lounges for you to sit and enjoy the beach.  There are quite a number of surf schools here, so you can see some beginners trying to learn to surf.  This area is definitely not for swimming as the waves are strong.  But it's a nice place to stroll around the beach and hear the waves.There are some warungs around the area too, where you can get some food.  And there are a couple of bars just off the street parallel to the beach, if you dig the night life.You can see locals selling their wares, but they are not pushy as I've read about.  They sell jewelries, watches, kites.  The kites were actually quite nice and intricate, I saw one they were flying which was a pirate ship with many sails.  Actually I was just walking along, they offered 200,000 at first then even without any reaction from me except a smile, they lowered it to 100,000.  I figured I could get it for 50,000 if I haggled, haha!  But I didn't intend to buy it since it was too difficult to bring home anyway.The sand is ok, but it's brown.  There are also some garbage along the beach, plus patches of them along the sides, which is really a waste of the beauty of the beach.  I don't mind the brown/black sand as long as the beach is clean.  My friend told me Kuta Beach is even worse.In the evening, you can see a lot of local folks who have come to enjoy the beach.I was excited to see the sunset, unfortunately, it was raining that day, so I missed it.  Instead, I had a walk under the rain with my umbrella on the pathway just parallel to the beach, which was also nice ;-)",legian double six actually middle point kuta seminyak double six near edge legian start seminyakin term crowd see less crowd kuta although still see lots umbrella lounge sit enjoy quite number surf school see beginner try learn surf area definitely swim wave strong nice place stroll around hear wavesthere warungs around area food couple bar street parallel dig night lifeyou see local sell ware pushy ive read sell jewelry watch kite kite actually quite nice intricate saw one fly pirate ship many sail actually walk along offer 200000 first even without reaction except smile lower 100000 figure 50000 haggled haha didnt intend buy difficult bring home anywaythe sand ok brown garbage along plus patch along side really waste beauty dont mind brownblack sand long clean friend tell kuta even worsein even see lot local folk come enjoy beachi excited see sunset unfortunately rain day miss instead walk rain umbrella pathway parallel nice,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.693, 'pos': 0.234, 'compound': 0.9825}",0.9825,positive

On this occasion, I had guests staying with me at my Villa and I had assured them this should be ticked off their bucket list!   As always, several ""Beer boys"" descended upon us and I ordered 3 chilled beers, as we were ushered to some rather old and grubby looking laybacks.   As they were uncomfortable on our backs, we requested chairs.  Anyway, the beer was chilled to perfection.  As the beers were delivered I was advised that it would cost each of us IDR to sit on these chairs, about which I was most embarrassed in front of my friends.  I paid the bill when we left and added IDR for the uncomfortable laybacks, making it perfectly clear that such demands are damaging the image of 66 Beach and people will go elsewhere for their beers.On top of that, Taxi's were asking IDR100,000 to transfer back to Seminyak because of 66 being 1-way!

I previously thought that Kelingking Beach, despite its name, was just a T-Rex shaped rock, however, you can make the cliff face descent down to a secluded, pristine beach. The journey is not for the faint-hearted, or those afraid of heights, as it is a very steep climb down a crude pathway with ropes and bamboo bannisters for support. I suggest either going barefoot or wearing joggers. It took us about 30 mins to get down, and another 30 mins to get back up, with time to spare for swimming in the beautiful beach between climbs  (note that the beach is predictably unpatrolled).

Sep 2019,"Yes the views are incredible, but, the attraction is down right dangerous & irresponsibly managed. Tourists who think they're in for a challenging but doable walk down a mountain to a beach are in for a shock. At least half of the 'path' is sheer, vertical drops, requiring climbing, hanging, and holding on to broken side rails made literally of sticks & bamboo. Should you twist your ankle or break something you'd be in serious trouble, let alone hoe easy it would be to tumble through the 'side rails' and drop straight down the side of a cliff. With no room to pass walkers coming down or up, you have to find ways to get off the narrow path, again incredibly risky. I'm shocked that local & Indonesian tourism officials are ok with the state of the path. Should someone need critical, emergency care there'd be no hope.

From the top you can see amazing views of the beach and you can even spot manta ray fish, we could see at least 4. Then we decided to take the stairs to the bottom so we can swim in beautiful turquoise sea and play in the white soft sand. However, there was almost no stairs, it was more similar to climbing a rocky mountain, it was very steep, long, and challenging. Wearing a shoe for this hike is a must. The first half of the broken stairs was fine but the other half was definitely harder, no stairs, only broken rocks to step on. I think it took around 40 minutes to go down, and climbing back up was even harder. While keeping in mind that there is traffic on the stairs. After finally reaching the bottom, it was all still beautiful, but the sea was also rough, high waves and strong tide, so it was hard to relax in the sea. In the beach there was only one small place selling some drinks and snacks. Overall, it was definitely very beautiful, the view and scene was amazing.

The view from the cliff is just amazing and (if you're fit enough to descend to the beach and climb back up) the beach itself is very rewarding. Yes!

Opportunity came when my husband and I took a trip to Bali and spend a night in Nusa Penida.Kelinking Beach was literally just as gorgeous as it is on Instagram. Haha. Truth!! So many beautiful views of it. I probably took a million photos. For real. As far as the hike down to the bottom...my husband has a fear of heights so had no desire to attempt. I wanted to hike down, but had only flip-flops on that day (whoops). I did hike down a little bit of the way down the initial really-steep part, and it wasn't *so* bad. Honestly if you have a pretty good baseline level of fitness (ie: I work out 2-4x/week, so this is coming from that perspective), and you have on good footwear, and water, you'll be fine. Just maintain 3 points of contact and move slowly - testing the strength of the bamboo rails before you put any weight on them. Its do-able. I could have done it in flip flops, but I didn't want to ditch my husband lol.Beyond the actual views, there are a bunch of warungs where you can get food and drink, fresh coconut, etc. We did have to pay a small fee (15,000? 11,000 IDR?) to park our motorbike there as well, which was fine. The road to the actual beach is not paved and needs some serious work -- the east side of the island, in comparison, is *much* nicer in that regard.

May 2019,"Kelingking Beach is a hidden beach in the village of Bunga Mekar, on the southwestern coast of Nusa Penida island. You can enjoy one of the most breath-taking views over the hills and small strip of white sand from atop a hill of the same name. The sight features a limestone headland covered in green, against the deep blue waters of the open Indian Ocean. This unique formation is reminiscent of a Tyrannosaurus Rex head, hence its nickname ‘T-Rex Bay’. The secluded beach itself is down a rugged 400m cliffside hike. This is recommended only for the fit and adventurous.Enjoying the scenic seascape and taking photos and selfies from above would be sufficient for most. You can enjoy the sweeping views from a purpose-built platform, which is bordered by bamboo fences. If you dare the challenging trek down to the beach, make sure it’s during low tide. Some sections of the path can be steep, requiring a bit of rock climbing, especially on the way back up. Locals have put rocks and bamboos to aid visitors over the years. Once you’ve reached the sand, you’ll have it all to yourself most of the time. Depending on tide conditions, the waters are swimmable. However, note that the undercurrents can be strong, and being the remote site that it is, there are no lifeguards around. Besides your camera and a good pair of shoes, be sure to bring drinking water with you on the descent, to keep you hydrated. You can combine your visit to Kelingking Beach with a visit to an interesting temple nearby.

The water was calm and clear and great for children.Warning signs are everywhere, telling people that they swim at their own risk as lifeguards are not present and jellyfish are an issue at certain times during the year, although we went snorkeling and did not see any.

I was confused to be informed that, by Indonesian law, no smoking was allowed on the property of any hotel (I have been staying in several hotel and resort properties both in Jakarta and Bali which all offered abundant accommodations for smokers in all outdoor areas, including private balcony's and terraces.). Additionally, no mention of their property being smoke-free was listed on their LHW page at the time of my bookingFurthermore, the duty manager, Mr. Falimra Kalmi, advised me that their resort was the only 6 star property in Indonesia, regardless of the fact that no hotel can be awarded more than five stars.   This '6 star' property was mostly decorated with obviously artificial flowers both in the room as well as public spaces.  Everywhere I turned there was signage warning guests of which activities were forbidden. While it's common hotel courtesy to be excused from a contract if an arriving guest does not find the property to be of his expectations, the duty manager absolutely refused to give any type of refund at all whatsoever.

Jan 2017,"I was in Seminyak in the winter 2014 and was already shocked then by the incredibly dirty beach and ocean. The sewage is running straight into the sea on various points along the beach. This has not changed at all from my first visit. The long ring road Jl.Drupadi at the time as in a horrible condition with sewage canals left and right from the street with the appropriate smell and moscitos, rats etc.This road was now completely redone with small but nice sidewalks now covering the mentioned canals. However, the sidewalks are usually parked with lots of motorbikes so that one still has to go down on the street all the time.And still by walking the streets, there is nothing changed with trash piles all over the place. At each street corner you see them and nobody seems to bother. In contrary, when you tell the locals about it, they blame the tourists but my observations where that it is actually themselves throwing plastic bags, food containers, bottles and all other kinds of trash whereever they stand and walk.The same goes for the beach...dont tell the locals as they will explain you that the trash comes because of the storm and wind and coming from the neighboring islands. And even if the trash comes from another planet: CLEAN IT UP !!!! Tourists have choices.. For the long flying time from Europe, you would expect paradise but coming into horror. We had a similar island in the mediteranean called Mallorca which was developped for tourism very early, similar to Bali, with the same negative aspects. But they have learned it the hard way and changed their approach to tourism almost 20 years ago by imposing taxes on tourists, cleaning up the entire island, building trash incineration plants, building water desalination plants, since they also had a major water problem, building proper roads and a great pubic transport system.This island is now an example how it can move from a current Bali standard into something called a true vacation paradise..but of course it does not come cheap and it will turn away certain types of tourists and will take time.

Sep 2019,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha.",arrrrh one place didnt list agenda plan trip particularly people spend time tan crisp write completely bit harsh wish make exception still manage couple hour toe dip coolness sea watch listen great ocean wave tingle u excitement almost sweep u case sand stress 17 hour flight blissseminyak 10 minute walk alea hotel route straight cut residential area dot quaint villa tropical greenery temperature didnt hold back midday sun worshipper crawl back luxury hotel air con u great almost local vendor try delight u war friendly smiley people polite thank will suffice enjoyed moment peace calmness watch swirls wave come cool roast foot blaze heat sand salty sea air catch odd glimpse surfer conquer wave add fun sun spot crab pop pocket sand run sea well camouflaged longer spent walk gaze vastness ocean mindset touch sens one dream paradise make feel alive regain sanity clean line palm tree gently sway breeze sand soft youll leave picture postcard memory footprints others follow bar restaurant set late brunch park cafe people watch take photo end leisurely stroll bohemian cafe look one big tropical fruit cocktail invite cosy colourful bean bag low level table signpost funky quote picture relaxation peace love cafe overlook ocean feed water enjoy ambience guess fabulous party vibe even mover shaker enjoy beer watch amazing sunset recommendation definitely go press escape youll transport world calmness ride wave let free spirit run wild therapy cheap personally ill put future trip whats likeindu versha,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.609, 'pos': 0.323, 'compound': 0.9975}",0.9975,positive

In our travels, this is the filthiest beach we ever visited. There were a number of surfers taking lessons and others swimming. If I had children there is no way I would allow them to swim in those waters.  The first couple weeks the beaches were much the same, some days much worse than others. There were so many plastics washed ashore it was a horrific. I did not expect this. We were in Seminyak almost one month and every day we made a point to walk the three beaches. Some days the locals were out raking what seemed to be an endless task and other days we saw pay-loader tractors with buckets transporting the trash to designated areas and making large piles. We spoke with locals and they explained that during the rainy season especially and high tide the winds and currents carry the trash from several rivers into the ocean and onto the beach. We were very fortunate to catch the beaches clean and water clear and not cloudy. Having the luxury of time when visiting any place can change your attitude and assumptions. Sometimes we can be too quick to judge a place. Sadly for some we met, they only had a few days or a week to visit it at it’s worse.",first glance upon arrival walk beach seminyak legian kuta back reaction kidding word come mind sad pathetic tragedy travel filthiest visit number surfer take lesson others swim child way allow swim water first couple week beaches much day much bad others many plastic wash ashore horrific expect seminyak almost one month every day make point walk three beach day local rake seem endless task day saw payloader tractor bucket transport trash designate area make large pile speak local explain rainy season especially high tide wind current carry trash several river ocean onto fortunate catch beach clean water clear cloudy luxury time visit place change attitude assumption sometimes quick judge place sadly meet day week visit worse,"{'neg': 0.186, 'neu': 0.723, 'pos': 0.091, 'compound': -0.9477}",-0.9477,negative

Apr 2017,"This is for anyone visiting,  or thinking of visiting Seminyak this year (2017).These are only our own opinions based on our recent holiday there. GETTING THERE: Most people will arrive via Denpasar Airport, and from the arrivals hall you'll enter a very busy area with hordes of people holding name boards,  and even more taxi drivers vying for your business.  My advice here is to ensure that you've pre-booked a taxi through your hotel. Your (c30 min) journey to your Seminyak hotel will then be easier and probably less expensive.  Our pre-booked taxi cost £15.FIRST IMPRESSIONS: Ok, Denpasar and environs is never going to win any beauty awards, if you're familiar with the Far East then the ramshackle set-up, the huge volume of crazily driven scooters, and the antithesis to Western order won't come as a shock, but if Bali is your first time east of the Mediterranean then be patient and stick with it.  Seminyak has been designed for enjoyment whilst Denpasar is a capital city with few reasons to linger.Seminyak is quite compact and this review only encompasses this area and not Kuta. The vast majority of the accommodation in town is either beach facing,  or a short walk from the beach.HOTELS: Whilst we can only comment specifically on one, the excellent Taum Resort, we saw enough of the others during our stay to build a very favourable opinion on standards,  most were 4* and quite a few the vaunted 5* quality, and they looked every inch comparable with the best beach hotels in Europe. We saw a number of very smart beachfront hotels with sun decks, pools and lovingly manicured gardens, where the almost daily stunning sunsets could be enjoyed in blissful surroundings. NIGHTLIFE : This is where Seminyak scores highly.  It's set-up for people who like to enjoy life once the sun goes down - but that said,  it's not trying to be an Ibiza. We felt that the beating heart of Seminyak was given over to couples,  irrespective of age (we're 40's and 50's), and testimony to this were the range of other couples that we met during our stay; the vast majority being Australian  (3 hrs flight from Perth for example ). Lots of 'gap year' youngsters and 'Eat, Pray, Love' wannabe types looking for adventure or love (or both). They'd all gravitated to the right place, heaps of great bars and restaurants and enough high-end nightspots to please every taste,  budget and preference,  most people will have heard of Potato Head and Ku De Ta etc, they're very good as you'd expect, but look beyond them and the supporting cast will enthrall you and your money will go a long way. Although just examples and exchange rates will fluctuate, you'll find most bars trying to lure you in with 2-1 cocktails or 2-1 Happy Hour deals for around (UK) £1.50 for the beer (Bintang is the excellent local beer) and £3 for the cocktails,  compare this to London prices and you'll be in the slightly unusual position of feeling mildly wealthy.  Eating out bears similar fruit and we enjoyed some brilliant food in extremely atmospheric restaurants for Wetherspoons type prices! For a couple of personal recommendations try La Laguna, Ginger Moon, Batik, Grocer & Grind,  but there are nany more as good.  In short then, tons of choice,  fantastic service wherever you go,  and very kind on your pocket  (have you booked yet?).SAFETY: This one comes in two parts.  If you're reading this and you're an adult,  or going with other adults,  then this will be the safest place you've ever been unless you drink too much,  if you get drunk then at some point you're likely to fall foul of the 2-wheeled 24/7 carnage that is the half a billion scooters that compete for space on the narrow Seminyak streets, these things are literally everywhere and at times the lunatic drivers (term used loosely ) will mount the kerb and use the footpath. Many of the scooters appear to be carrying at least 3 generations of the same family and they'll all have aboard items such as ladders, power saws, live animals and the sort of stuff we'd need a Qashqai to transport. We took photos of the aforementioned just because we figured the folks back home wouldn't believe us! Crossing the road in Bali would be classed as a dangerous sport in the Uk, but help is normally on hand courtesy of the ubiquitous security guards, who guard everything.  They all carry illuminated batons and make full use of the whistles that they also carry, if they spot that you're struggling to cross the road then they're out there in a jiffy to see you safely across.  Top boys.The pavements are hilarious in that one minute they're there,  and then the next minute they've either ended abruptly at a large chasm,  or a  set of neck height power lines (not kidding) ,  or....the pavement just reappears on the opposite side of the street. So, given the last point,  I'd implore any parents with babies,  toddlers,  or pre-teen children to take a holiday elsewhere,  because we saw so many anguished parents frantically trying to either control their kids next to the Nurbergring town roads,  or trying to stop enough of the wacky races participants in order to get to the other side,  hugely dangerous and quite disturbing to see. Bali is lovely but small children brought up with UK road sense are in peril here.Like I said earlier, sensible adults will have no issues here. BEACH : This was a shock to us. When we booked our holiday we of course Googled Bali (Seminyak) beach images,  and feasted our eyes on the stunning shots. In reality there are times when the long Seminyak Beach is quite the opposite. In the wet season it rains regularly and when it does the stuff cones down in torrents,  add to this the generally observed habit of throwing most litter into the gutter,  then you'll quickly realise that all of the litter is quickly washed into surface water culverts that themselves wash into the small rivers that flow through the town. These then run straight into the sea,  and the tide deposits the whole lot on the tide line early doors the next morning! ! Take a beach stroll on the morning after one of the regular evening thunderstorms and you'll see what I mean.; absolutely shocking mess and not safe for walking on as you can imagine.  The Balinese seem to employ a small army of people (many wearing face masks and PPE) plus tractors to try and make good this mess every day.  When this has been done then large swathes of the beach do justice to the brochure images,  but just be aware that at times the beach can be quite awful and there has to be some effort made to try and improve the littering situation which I have to say is more down to the locals,  than the visitors!TAXIS: Worthy of its own section,  the town is chock full of taxis and this whirring convoy just seems to endlessly circulate around the centre (AKA Seminyak Square) looking for anyone 'walking '. We deduced that when Balinese taxi drivers take their training course their first instruction is the assumption that someone walking is in dire need of a fare-paying lift! From the second you creep beyond the wall of your hotel EVERY taxi driver will hit his horn and slow down,  many will stop and wind down their window and wait for you to agree that 'yes....you can't possibly walk 100 metres to the beach / bar / shop, and that you need a lift'.  The trick is to either smile and carry on walking, or just ignore them. Both methods work equally well but the good news is that these guys aren't the least bit pushy or aggressive. You get used to the patter and we assume that they get used to just driving around all day.That said, be advised of the ongoing scams. The ONLY officially licensed taxis are Blue Bird. That doesn't help you with recognition because in Bali EVERY taxi is blue and the same model  (Toyota ) as the official ones!  Also many of the unlicensed taxis have the name 'Blue XXXX' that look almost identical to the pucker version. The difference being that if you ride in a dodgy taxi then the driver will either say ""meter not working"", or when you arrive at your destination,  he will say ""no change"". The latter is a patent lie of course, and if you enter a taxi with ""broken meter "" then get straight out. We of course fell fowl of both on day one, but a very helpful 'official ' Blue Bird driver apprised us of the dark side of Seminyak taxis on day two,  citing that unlicensed drivers face fines if caught with dodgy meters or if they're discourteous to customers.  In summary we found the whole taxi topic amusing,  and I'd also add that almost every driver  stopped or slowed down if they saw that we wanted to cross the street.In terms of fares. From our hotel to either the beach or Seminyak Square,  both a 30 min walk,  we'd pay the minimum evening fare of IDR 30.OOO. Which worked out at £2 at the March exchange rate of IDR 16000 to £1. MONEY: I've alluded to the generally very agreeable cost of eating and drinking out, taxis I've also said are cheap,  and with a total absence of other means of public transport you might want to engage your hotel in finding a locally recommended driver. We hired a friendly driver who took us all around the island for £30 per day, try doing that in the UK and you'll be adding another '0', fantastic value and all of the drivers speak good English  (as do almost all Balinese ).There are numerous ATM's dotted around Seminyak and my wife and I used different ATM's with our respective banks and the exchange rates worked out at broadly the same as the exchange rates that we'd been given prior to setting off from the UK. If you're a single female traveller and are conscious of security with your cards / money then there are a couple of cash machines inside the new shopping mall in Seminyak Square, the latter housing some good shops,  but tons of better ones that aren't generic 'high street' around the town that are well worth a look.  THE PEOPLE : If you've been to Thailand then you'll be sitting there thinking that 'nobody is friendlier than the Thai's', I know you're thinking that because we thought so, too. But come here and you'll be truly in the presence of the nicest people on God's green Earth. We were humbled by their humility,  their values,  their sheer desire to make a difference to your day. The service we received in every single venue, bar, hotel, or even total strangers in the street was so genuine,  so wonderful,  that to not come back to Bali would be a crime. Come and see for yourself,  if you've been promising yourself  / husband / wife / partner to take a trip to Bali then go to your bank tomorrow,  or beg a wealthy relative for funds,  sell that useless artefact or trade-in the boat you never used,  and drag your weary body to this temple of soul salvation, I promise you that you will enjoy every moment and you'll return to our embittered crime -ridden soulless country a better person.SEMINYAK: Yes it's a fabulous destination.  It's not without its faults and I'd advocate it's not fit for young children or the infirm,  but if your mojo has lost its sparkle then this is the place to lift your spirits. Great hotels, great nightlife, and incredible people. WEATHER: There are two main seasons in Bali. Hot and wet and hot and dry. We came end of March which is towards the end of the wet season. We had rain almost every day but in the main the rain and thunderstorms came late afternoon or during the night. When it rains it comes down in torrents but the temperature doesn't drop,  meaning it gets very humid. When the sun comes out it's blistering hot and most days the mercury will climb up to 32c (90f in old money ) and often beyond. The actual temperature feels hotter so the 'real feel' in the daytime is more like 40c (104f). Bear that in mind if you're fair skinned!  At night the thermometer rarely dips below 25c (77f) so you'll not need to bring outer layers here save for a rain mac. What disappointed me was the appalling lack of weather forecast detail available online in the lead up to our holiday.  The BBC didn't feature a single location on Bali,  others just gave a  generic 'cut and paste ' tropics forecast, and the go-to Wunderground  (Weather Underground ) gave pessimistic forecasts which simply stated ""cloud,  frequent thunderstorms "" for most of the days we were there,  and whilst 'yes' we did get some cloud and some storms,  the latter's forecasts made no mention of the 5-6 hours of blazing sunshine that we got each day. Only one day out of 12 was 'bang on' their prediction. So I'm saying don't take too much notice of the forecasts before you come out here,  they're not accurate enough!  Have a great time.

Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are awful and this one is no different. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourists come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. There is also polluted water that seriously smells like sewerage flowing into the ocean and kids play in it!! I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are still pristine paradise so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc. I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer. This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person. All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.

Dec 2018,"(written after 1st day, update after that)After starting our Bali trip in Sanur, where the beach was clean, with zero plastic and crystal, still waters, the Seminyak beach DUMP was a shocking experience!A very nice, classic monumental beach, tens of kilometres long, and more than 50 m wide, with this solid, easy-walking sand, BUT FULL OF PLASTIC! Both the beach and the water as well. And small rivers bring sewage, nauseous.Could not swim at all, so ugly! Fortunately we had such a nice villa, we could stay there.About this disaster we discussed for long with our villa manager. Well, he said that the beach is not such all the time, but twice a year. Then there is certain wind, that now started blowin 4 days ago, and it brings a lot of wood pieces and plastic ashore.Usually lasts around a week. Good thing to see, compared to eg. Thailand, was to see, that there was an army of government paid workers cleaning beach, and trucks driving the waste away. On our 1 hour walk I think we saw more than hundred workers on a 2km strip of beach.Still, it will last days for the sea to vommit all the carbage to the land for them to pick up.I asked where is the litter from, and the manager told us, it is from ther rivers, namely Balis own rivers, not coming further away. He said there is a lot going on in Bali to tackle the issue, but the change is slow, and presumed it take at least one lifetime. They do realize that tourists won't come if it is not clean!And, maybe tourists have already started to shun Bali as both in Sanur and in Seminyak it was really quite, the restaurants empty all night etc.?They are banning the plastic straws already, which is a start, but most of the plastic litter seems to be smaller than plastic bags, these everyday wrappers for food. Why do we need to wrap a single sweet into plastic?(updated after the second last day)Well, during the last day, the beach seemed cleaner, the armies of cleaners had succeeded and it seemed less new trash coming. However, when standing in the sea knee deep, almost every wave brouht ugly things to skin...(updated after the last day)The situation got even better, less crap.
