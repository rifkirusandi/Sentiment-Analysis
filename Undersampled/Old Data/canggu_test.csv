Naturally, you'll also find Australians due to the proximity. As you reach the beach at the end of Jl Pantai Batau Bolong, you will find bars, cafes and restaurants serving hungry tourists and surfers. There are also surf boards for hire. The main mode of transport to get here is by scooter which can be hired almost anywhere or taxi. It is also a great spot to watch the sun set or just pop on one of the sun lounges set up by locals with their little shacks that sell beers and soft drinks and food. The lounges are free if you purchase a beverage with them.

Jan-17,Canggu Beach is a black sand volcanic beach which makes it look a little unattractive for us Australians used to white sand and sparkling blue seas. However I found it a really good place to hang out and have conversations with fellow travellers at various bars that line the sand. These range from wildly expensive (Western priced) complete with swimming pools and lovely lounging furniture through to cheap little warnings which offer bean bags under beach umbrellas. There was a bit of surf when I was there and its possible to hire boards. I am a little reluctant to swim in south Bali ocean because of poor  sewage and a big population but lots of people were taking the plunge. It was boisterous sea so be careful if you are a weak swimmer - lots of sandbanks and turbulence.

There are also far too many people for it to be all that pleasant.  Stray dogs are also a pest.The most popular stretch of beach is that in front of the various warungs and bars perched above.  Row after row of cheap beach loungers with parasols are full of people during peak season.  With all the people come rubbish which is not looked after really at all as much of the beach is a mess.The mess is made worse by dogs.  Stray and owned dogs are on the beach and their produce is a hazard that needs to be looked out for.The beach itself is black sand which can be ok but here is not fine enough to be a pleasant experience.  The waves in this part of the world are moderate but even when it did not seem that blustery it was still not possible to enter the water as warning signs were posted.  Even wading in a few yards was prohibited.Hawkers were present but were not overly persistent.

I could not imagine going anywhere else now!! It was the perfect place if you're a young professional looking for a bit of night life without the party scene.  Everywhere felt new, clean, and the perfect mix of boho/Balinese culture.  We stayed in an Air BnB right off the main drive but in a fairly quiet space and it was PERFECT.  Walking distance to the beach, Love Anchor, Crate Cafe, and any restaurant or happy hour you could desire.  We moved locations half way through our trip to another city and actually took a taxi back to Canggu on our last day because we just couldn't get enough! This magical little space full of beautiful shops, beaches, happy hours, scooters, and the most magical humans is one for the books.  Grab a cheap beer at Echo Beach Club, a bucket of fries, and watch the sunset to end each day.
