19-Sep,"Arrrrh the beach... this is one place we didn’t list on our agenda when planning our trip, as we’re not particularly beach people who spend time tanning ourselves to a crisp! Writing it off completely was a bit harsh and I wish we had made an exception just this once. Still, we managed a couple of hours toe dipping in the coolness of the sea, watching and listening to the great ocean waves, tingling us with excitement and almost sweeping us in, it was a case of “sand on, stress off” after a 17 hour flight! This was bliss...Seminyak Beach is 10 minutes walk from The Alea hotel, the route is a straight cut through residential area dotted with quaint villas and tropical greenery. The temperatures didn’t hold back, after all it was mid-day when most sun worshippers had crawled back to the luxury of their hotels air con. For us it was great having the beach almost to ourselves.  A few local vendors trying to delight us with their wares, friendly smiley people and a polite “no thank you” will suffice.  We enjoyed moments of peace and calmness, watching swirls of waves coming in and cooling down our roasted feet from the blazing heat of the sand.  The salty sea air and catching an odd glimpse of a surfer conquering a wave added to our fun in the sun.  We spotted crabs popping out from pockets of sand and running into the sea, so well camouflaged.  The longer we spent just walking and gazing at the vastness of the ocean my mindset touched senses one can only dream off in paradise, making me feel alive and regaining my sanity.  The beach is clean, lined with palm trees gently swaying in the breeze and sand so soft you’ll be leaving picture postcard memories and footprints for others to follow. Bars and restaurants setting up for late brunches, we parked ourselves at a cafe,  people watched and took few photos.  We ended our leisurely stroll at a bohemian cafe which looked like one big tropical fruit cocktail, inviting cosy colourful bean bags, low level tables and a signpost with some funky quotes, this was a picture of relaxation, peace and love. The cafe overlooks the ocean where you can get fed and watered enjoying the ambience and I guess a fabulous party vibe in the evening for ‘movers and shakers’, enjoying a few beers and watching an amazing sunset.      Our recommendation: Definitely go for it! all you have to do is press ‘escape’ and you’ll be transported into a world of calmness, ride a wave and let your free spirit run wild, this is therapy on the cheap.  Personally for me, I’ll be putting the beach on future trips, after all what’s not to like?....Indu & Versha.",arrrrh one place didnt list agenda plan trip particularly people spend time tan crisp write completely bit harsh wish make exception still manage couple hour toe dip coolness sea watch listen great ocean wave tingle u excitement almost sweep u case sand stress 17 hour flight blissseminyak 10 minute walk alea hotel route straight cut residential area dot quaint villa tropical greenery temperature didnt hold back midday sun worshipper crawl back luxury hotel air con u great almost local vendor try delight u war friendly smiley people polite thank will suffice enjoyed moment peace calmness watch swirls wave come cool roast foot blaze heat sand salty sea air catch odd glimpse surfer conquer wave add fun sun spot crab pop pocket sand run sea well camouflaged longer spent walk gaze vastness ocean mindset touch sens one dream paradise make feel alive regain sanity clean line palm tree gently sway breeze sand soft youll leave picture postcard memory footprints others follow bar restaurant set late brunch park cafe people watch take photo end leisurely stroll bohemian cafe look one big tropical fruit cocktail invite cosy colourful bean bag low level table signpost funky quote picture relaxation peace love cafe overlook ocean feed water enjoy ambience guess fabulous party vibe even mover shaker enjoy beer watch amazing sunset recommendation definitely go press escape youll transport world calmness ride wave let free spirit run wild therapy cheap personally ill put future trip whats likeindu versha,"{'neg': 0.068, 'neu': 0.609, 'pos': 0.323, 'compound': 0.9975}",0.9975,1

16-Jan,"Over all the beach is nice. The part where locals go is not as clean as the part where high end hotels are located. I think the problem is that the beach doesn't have enough bins. So people just leave rubbish on the beach which is terrible. Especially when you walk down the little park on peninsular it is littered with cigaret buds, plastics, etc. And again no one cleans the area and no bins around. It's actually quite scandalous to see considering it is called one of the luxury beaches in South Kuta! Also, I personally would like to suggest to the local authorities to ban smoking on the beach and provide dedicated areas for it to stop the problem of the cigaret buds scattered across the beach! And issue fines for people who leave rubbish behind! It will not only provide smoke free beach for the children but also will save the sea from the trash. Bali should do more to tackle the trash issue if they want to meet the European standards.
