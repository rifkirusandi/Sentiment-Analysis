19-Dec,Wrote a previous review up our stay in Seminyak and visiting the beaches here in Bali.Found Double 6 beach filled with plastics from high to low water. Nothing in the way of locals picking up the rubbish ranging from plastic bottle tops to plastic bags and old rope. How much damage is all this rubbish doing to marine life and not to mention the tourists entering these waters... the rubbish is not from tourism but from the rivers that flood once rain has fallen. Once you look beyond the rubbish I wonder how much none seen pollutants are in there!!!?.,write previous review stay seminyak visit beach balifound double 6 fill plastic high low water nothing way local pick rubbish range plastic bottle top plastic bag old rope much damage rubbish marine life mention tourist enter water rubbish tourism river flood rain fall look beyond rubbish wonder much none see pollutant,"{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.869, 'pos': 0.033, 'compound': -0.5423}",-0.5423,0

19-Dec,Stayed in Seminyak for 5 days. Visited the beach three times and very disappointed with the amount of plastics on the beach..never been anywhere and seen such an amount of plastics from high to low water. Tourists actually walking along picking up all the debris. There are tractors on the beach raking the sand but not picking up and debris. Find it hard to believe that the tourist board/government allow tourists to swim and paddle  amongst this filth. The amount tourism brings to Bali then take some of your tourists money and pay local people to pick up the rubbish... the amount of rubbish on the beach depends upon rainfall flooding the rivers and taking it down to settle on the beaches. Anyone going in the sea comes face to face with the rubbish pity help any other unseen nasties are in the water...... expect a tourism tax to be incurred if action taken to clean up.,stay seminyak 5 day visit three time disappointed amount plastic beachnever anywhere see amount plastic high low water tourist actually walk along pick debris tractor rake sand pick debris find hard believe tourist boardgovernment allow tourist swim paddle amongst filth amount tourism bring bali take tourist money pay local people pick rubbish amount rubbish depend upon rainfall flooding river take settle beach anyone go sea come face face rubbish pity help unseen nasties water expect tourism tax incur action take clean,"{'neg': 0.145, 'neu': 0.775, 'pos': 0.08, 'compound': -0.6124}",-0.6124,0

(if you want to read more on my discoveries on Bali beaches, read my reviews about Sanur and Seminyak beaches, I refer here also to those texts)The devastating plastic explosion here was a shock. And, no comfort did we receive which was the case in Semiyak, from armies of cleaners and comforting words: this is only few days.The Beaches kilometres long full of plastic, and NO ONE cleaning them. The beach shag keepers just waited and let the sea come and take it back.Here the locals don't even say it to last only a few days, but even months, the rainy season. And they directly say it is balinese own fault: the trash comes from rivers, and the rainy seasons lift the rivers to flooding, which empties the carbage into ocean.Ugly, awful.  Update on day 4: Around the Finns Beach Club we found some 300m long streak of beach, which was clean. Maybe the currents had spared this, and would imagine that here they do clean. Update on the last day: Ok, the Canggu beach consist of many shorter strips, my comments concern the area between the Pantai Kayu Putih and Pantai Batu Bolong beaches (according to google maps).",spent 6 day xmas want read discovery bali beach read review sanur seminyak beach refer textsthe devastate plastic explosion shock comfort receive case semiyak army cleaner comfort word daysthe beach kilometre long full plastic one cleaning shag keeper wait let sea come take backhere local dont even say last day even month rainy season directly say balinese fault trash come river rainy season lift river flood empty carbage oceanugly awful update day 4 around finn club find 300m long streak clean maybe current spar imagine clean update last day ok canggu consist many short strip comment concern area pantai kayu putih pantai batu bolong beach accord google map,"{'neg': 0.135, 'neu': 0.74, 'pos': 0.125, 'compound': -0.296}",-0.296,0

17-Dec,"Seminyak Beach has many entry points.  We entered from the Polis Post in Seminyak (you can enter through Ku De Ta too) or one of the villas or hotels facing the beach.  Compared to Kuta Beach, this beach is relatively free of rubbish, water sports touts and people.  It begins to get crowded with people when you are walking on the beach approaching where Ku De Ta Restaurant is.The water sports costs are more expensive too.  In Kuta, you pay 50,000 rupiah per person (after bargaining) for 2 hours of the surf board; but in Seminyak it is 80,000 rupiah per person for 2 hours.

I fell in love with Canggu and longed to get back. Now, being back a couple of times I start to see more clearly and I have adjusted my opinion about Canggu.Canggu is used to be covered by abundance rice fields and limitless coconut trees at her beaches, the saying goes. But now it is becoming, pitifully, more and more like her oldest sisters, Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Here and there you can see pieces of rice fields, but villa's at various styles and sizes are becoming the dominant landscape. Surfers come for all over the world to use this place as their playground. Cafe's and Bar, all made to fit the western styles, are in abundance. I do not get this. If you are on holiday in exotic country, why on earth you want to have croissant with bacon for breakfast, mozzarella salad for lunch and spare ribs for dinner? Try nasi bungkus instead at local waroeng for € 0.4 ( Rp. 5.000). Try kopi tubruk (Balinese coffee) instead of espresso. And ask for a bike for transportation, instead of a motorcycle. Perhaps by doing this there is a vain hope that the damage is a little less than worst.The mass tourism, wherein I, myself, also participate, has contributed to the loss of more and more rice fields or to put it more critically, the loss of Balinese' authenticity and its nature.  How ironic the fate of Balinese. Thousand of years ago they run away from the influence of Islam by sailing from Java to be able to preserve its culture, only to be now slowly destroyed by mass tourism. This time, sadly, there is no escape for Balinese.",first time go canggu june 2014 still relatively quiet visit batu bolong especially compare kuta fell love canggu long back now back couple time start see clearly adjust opinion canggucanggu use cover abundance rice field limitless coconut tree beach say go now become pitifully old sister kutalegianseminyak see piece rice field villa various style size become dominant landscape surfer come world use place playground cafe bar make fit western style abundance holiday exotic country earth want croissant bacon breakfast mozzarella salad lunch spare rib dinner try nasi bungkus instead local waroeng 04 rp 5000 try kopi tubruk balinese coffee instead espresso ask bike transportation instead motorcycle perhaps vain hope damage little less worstthe mass tourism wherein participate contributed loss rice field put critically loss balinese authenticity nature ironic fate balinese thousand year ago run away influence islam sailing java able preserve culture now slowly destroy mass tourism time sadly escape balinese,"{'neg': 0.118, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.103, 'compound': -0.3818}",-0.3818,0

The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help.

19-Jun,"….This 5km section of the continuous KUTA-CANGGU beach strip rates AVERAGE by Bali mainland standards but BELOW AVERAGE by world standards….You don’t come to Bali for great beaches...correction, you may come to Bali to sit on the beach in tropical conditions when it’s  freezing at home, sipping a cut price cocktail yada…..but the beach will not be whelming…. not on the mainland at least.I’m a beach blogger with over 3 million hits – get back to BALI annually and always make a point of cycling/walking SEMINYAK – stayed inland there a few years back. I’ve visited thousands of beaches over 40 years and would not rate BALI MAINLAND’s best in my top 500. Offshore LEMBONGAN may just scrape in. IN CONTRAST gorgeous and spectacular ARTUH BEACH** (offshore NUSA PENIDA) would make my top 10. Maybe even top 3.But hey, if you seldom see a beach, you may think SEMINYAK the ants pants. As FERRIS BUELLER’S bookie never said: “Sure beats a sand-pit in south SPRINGFIELD”.See. what we have here is a long strip of sand where it’s easy to find a fairly deserted section - or to sit with a crowd on rather swish sun-loubge/umbrella combinations if that’s your jam. These more crowded parts are outside the bigger resorts (all sized high-end places back the beach along here) + where roads from inland (more accommodation) access the sand.There’s a gradual change heading north. South end near the big DOUBLE SIX** resort has sand similar to KUTA-LEGIAN: kinda tan-grey (rather than the gorgeous white stuff when I first visited in ‘75). Heading north it darkens somewhat – although never reaching the light black of CANGGU BCH immediately north. Most areas are quite wide but it does narrow in sections.Activity changes too – the first 400m is a continuation of the crowded KUTA-LEGIAN scene. 3 or 4 beach bars with cushions/small tables on the sand are a real scene around sunset. Moving north it becomes quieter with gaps between crowded areas. The far north can be very uncrowded.TIPS – those beach clubs: maybe 4 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw one with at least 1000 people on the sand!!!! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems high end. Dozens of all budget places within a 10 min stroll inland.- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.- wet season is not the best time to visit – lotsa rubbish and dirty storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here (hotels/airlines offer great low season packages) – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions.

18-Jun,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here.

Even so, I witnessed beach cleaners through out the day, cleaning the sand of things not just washed up, but things left by beach goers.  We have to be responsible visitors, too.  There was very little litter, that I could see and I spent two entire days there. There are people trying to sell you things, but hey, it's a living.

People should be soley employed to clean the beach and take the rubbish away. Helpful for the environment and it would provide employment.?With the amount of revenue that Bali is receiving from tourism, it's time for the Indonesian government to step up on the waste problem. The sea around Bali is heavily polluted with plastic. We saw three dead turtles whilst travelling in Indonesia, and were informed that the most common cause of a turtles premature death in those waters in due to ingesting plastic. Seminyak beach is covered in tiny pieces of plastic and polystyrene which ends up in marine life's stomachs. Which is wonderful for the local people who rely on fish for protein. We spoke to many fishermen who are outraged by this horrendous rubbish problem in the ocean. Playing in the waves you feel rubbish brushing past you and it's just not pleasant. One day we didn't even go in the sea as there was so much rubbish! There needs to be recycling facilities that are readily available and free for hotels in Seminyak and all of Bali. We saw local people raiding bins outside hotels for plastic bottles and cans, surely these could at least be left out for them!? We couldn't even find anywhere in Seminyak where we could refill our plastic water bottles. Human waste is also released into the sea all around Bali via the sewer pipes that go down the beach and out to sea.Also watch the current at Seminyak beach.

We walked to Seminyak Beach from our villa in the Jalan Kunti 1 area (near to Bali Deli), the first night we arrived to Bali.  We've been here a month - give or take - and I have not returned.  Early evening, and it's about a 20 minute, winding walk through the streets of Grosinyak to get there.  We arrive to find, not so much a beach, but more akin to a newly started landfill.  Plastic, garbage, washed up debris of all sorts, littering the beach and floating in the water.  Not exactly a Kodak moment!  And yet - swimmers, surfers and sun worshipers galore!  I guess it's that ""when in Rome"" mentality?  (I'd rather just go to Rome!)  Oh wait!  I lie!
