There is often a lot of thrash on the beach left there by the tides and feeded by the rivers of Bali and Java. Despite the overpopulation and 9 million visitors a year there is no proper thrash collection on Bali. The Balinese even avoid often the paid service there is and throw their thrash in the rivers. It ends up in the sea and the tide brings it to the beach including used pampers and worse. Just dumping in the sea also goes for the sewage. The whole island with millions of people doing there thing right into the sea. The consequences are that survers are confronted with ear infections and worse. The surfers are by the way the only people who can go safely into the sea. Bathing is risky because of the treacherous currents which take every year several people who drown. But it's a nice beach to walk.,nice take walk hot canggu mainly surf without much sunbathing accomodation often lot thrash leave tide feed river bali java despite overpopulation 9 million visitor year proper thrash collection bali balinese even avoid often pay service throw thrash river end sea tide brings include used pampers worse dump sea go sewage whole island million people thing right sea consequence survers confront ear infection bad surfer way people go safely sea bath risky treacherous current take every year several people drown nice walk,"{'neg': 0.214, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.8555}",-0.8555,negative

Nov 2015,"The first time I went to Canggu was in June 2014. It was then still relatively quiet beach (I visited Batu Bolong), especially if you compare with Kuta. I fell in love with Canggu and longed to get back. Now, being back a couple of times I start to see more clearly and I have adjusted my opinion about Canggu.Canggu is used to be covered by abundance rice fields and limitless coconut trees at her beaches, the saying goes. But now it is becoming, pitifully, more and more like her oldest sisters, Kuta/Legian/Seminyak. Here and there you can see pieces of rice fields, but villa's at various styles and sizes are becoming the dominant landscape. Surfers come for all over the world to use this place as their playground. Cafe's and Bar, all made to fit the western styles, are in abundance. I do not get this. If you are on holiday in exotic country, why on earth you want to have croissant with bacon for breakfast, mozzarella salad for lunch and spare ribs for dinner? Try nasi bungkus instead at local waroeng for € 0.4 ( Rp. 5.000). Try kopi tubruk (Balinese coffee) instead of espresso. And ask for a bike for transportation, instead of a motorcycle. Perhaps by doing this there is a vain hope that the damage is a little less than worst.The mass tourism, wherein I, myself, also participate, has contributed to the loss of more and more rice fields or to put it more critically, the loss of Balinese' authenticity and its nature.  How ironic the fate of Balinese.

The taxis have a hard time getting there because the sneaky shortcut to get in is usually patrolled by police ( should be one way only) So in order to get there from Seminyak its a good 20 minute cab ride. Seems the surfers love it and the ambiance of the area is very surfer cool. No tourist busses here. Phew!The sand is dark (volcanic) and the swimming is a bit risky ( lots of currents) however OLD MANS pub is a super cool place to get some food and cold beers and watch the surf.

Dec 2014,"The beaches of Bali are are awful. They are lowest common denominator tourist traps. The beach itself is dirty and polluted with garbage everywhere. If it rains or the wind blows onshore they seriously become like an garbage tip and you have to actually step over mountains of plastic. It's very sad to see the effect tourism has had here. It's kind of weird because millions of tourist come here, they sit there watching the sun set over the sea and they lounge about on the beach as though they don't even see the garbage. I'm from Australia and fortunately our beaches are pristine paradise.p so I just don't see the attraction of Kuta and seminyak etc.  I suppose some people live in some freezing grey part of Europe or some massive high rise in a polluted city and so for them just to see the ocean is an amazing expereince even if it is a filthy sewer.  This beach is also lined by deck chairs which you must pay for if you want shade because they have built  over where all the trees used to be. The guys who own the deck chairs will try to charge you ridiculous amounts of money but the going rate is about 50,000 per person.  All along here from seminyak and further north there are Bars and warungs. They all play really loud music to drown out the neighbouring bars. We were going to eat dinner there and found the entire experience really annoying so we had one beer and left. I like music with dinner but I don't like it blasting and I don't like to hear 3 different musics from all directions.

That's what really hurts, because we've been around the world before and seen high traffic areas and never seen a beach that had such natural beauty so spoiled by man-made, preventable debris.

Even as we went to a bar to sit and have a cocktail, the uncleanliness just followed through.

Mar 2015,"I quite liked Double Six Beach. It was a bit grubby with a bit of litter around etc but still a nice place to hang out, particularly at night. I hired an umbrella lounge for $5 and was soon approached by one of the many massage ladies who sell along the beach. They sell bracelets, sarongs, do manicures, massages, you name it, they do it. I had a great massage by a lovely older lady. She was very nice and it was a good massage. I paid about $13 Australian i guess which is probably more than the going rate for a beach massage, but i thought she was worth it. Bit annoying to have other ladies come and try to sell you things when you clearly have your eyes closed in the middle of a massage, i just tried to ignore them without being rude. Often they would go and get a little child to come back with them to see if that improved their sales tactics. If there was something i wanted to buy i would not have minded but how many sarongs and bracelets can you buy in bali??? This beach cafes etc were not really open during the lead up to Nyepi Day so we only got to go down there our last night. La Plancha was very popular with all the umbrellas and bean bags on the beach. We decided to go to the little place one up from them, i think it was called the Juice Park or something like that. Bean bags, not as busy and cheap drinks, we were very happy to hang out there and would certainly go back. Much quieter than La Plancha and we even had a foot massage on the bean bags, how cool is that. We stayed at the gorgeous Double Six Resort but next time would not waste my time drinking at their rooftop bar or their expensive pool area. At $16 for a very average cocktail i would rather drink cheap drinks on a bean bag on the beach any time. Especially with someone massaging my feet! Doesnt get any better than that in Bali!

Aug 2016,"What a great choice to stay at Double Six.  Looking around and making comparisons between different hotels is pretty easy, but letting go of your old favourite hotels to try something else doesn't come that easy.  But I'm so glad I did.  If it's time to look around for new options, Double Six will not disappoint.  Likewise if it's your first time to Bali, Double Six is a must stay for you. I know everyone says that staff are AMAZING at every 5 star Bali hotel, because of the lovely nature of the locals, but Double Six is in its own class.  I've stayed in Bali around 10 times and Double Six is unparalleled for their service.  The decor and architecture are modern and functional with beautiful aesthetics.  Most 5 star resorts can't give you local charm, but Double Six does.  It's opposite the beach and also has a side street in front with local shops and restaurants.  It's easy to see why Double Six sort out this location.  Somehow Double Six balances the sunshine with shade in a perfect way.  Whether you're in the pool, pool-side or the many food / drinking options, the weather seamlessly gives you all options.  Although the hotel is large, nothing is far away.  You don't have the feeling of 'walking down' to breakfast or 'waking down' to the pool.  Everything is close and simply.  And still Double Six is very spacious and private.  Take me out of some of the traditional (old) Bali hotels and take me to Double Six.  I feel other hotels lock you into their hotel grounds, while Double Six is open and free - stay by the pool or walk the beach, or local shops and restaurants.  Super easy and simple. On this occasion, there are a few kids or all ages, but mostly coupes and small groups of men and women is their early 30's. It's quiet, classy and relaxed with EVERYTHING you could ever want at your fingertips.  10/10 for Double Six.

The bathroom with a tv attached right in front of the bath tub. The shower in both forms shower head and over head tropical fall. The staff so pleasant and ok its part of the job but it just felt more organic than forced. We were late to the pool a few mornings and worried about no sun lounges but the pool and lagoon staff always found room for us. This was a big plus for my new wife as she loves the sun. It would be a disservice to name individuals because every one made the stay so pleasant for us. We dine on the rooftop on day one and the view is something to behold, the view especially at sunset is magical. Plus the food was really good and reasonable compared to irish prices anyway. On our last night we visited the plantation grill bar in the hotel, we stepped in the elevator and stepped out in 1922 New York. It was like the old time Jazz Bars from New York movies. The ambiance, the food, the music, the conpany and the drinks were all top class 5 star rating. A little pricey but well worth the quality. I must mention ""Koma"" our waiter , smiling from ear to ear and when he heard it was our honeymoon well he brought out a plate with happy honeymoon and some specialist chocolates, classy touch.

Jun 2019,"A NEW NAME AND APPEARANCE FOR AN OLD SPOT….­I first visited in the early 80s – stayed here in 2015 – and checked it out annually since.A NEW NAME - this 500m section of the 9km KUTA to CANGGU beach strip has only been referred to as DOUBLE SIX BEACH these past few years.Prior, it was simply that section where LEGIAN BCH changes to SEMINYAK BCH – abt 3km from the KUTA end. Makes sense: the huge DOUBLE SIX RESORT was not opened until AUG. ‘14.A NEW APPEARANCE – I used to cycle KUTA-CANGGU beach in the 80s. Back then, the busy hotel strip would start to peter out in LEGIAN – by the time I got to the D6 area there was nothing much in back of the beach – just the occasional resort accessed by tracks down from JL LEGIAN inland. How things have changed – continuous resorts now extend past D6 to north of SEMINYAK.So D6 BEACH has changed, but what is it like? Well it’s one of the more popular stretches of sand along this busy strip - because of GOOD ACCESS (Jalan  Arjuna hits the beach here from inland LEGIAN/STH SEMINYAK which have dozens of resorts covering all budgets - and the FABULOUS BEACH CLUBS with their on-sand soft cushions and little tables mentioned in many other reviews. The place is certainly attractive, with lotsa sunlounges for rent and those multi-coloured umbrellas. South of the beach clubs are a host of those local guys selling beer – buy from them and you get the plastic chair and table, usually an umbrella and are their friend for life. They often rent sunlounges, surfboards etcMY RATING Normally I would rate D6 Beach ABOVE AVERAGE but for one demerit – the open drain that runs below JL ARJUNA exits across the beach: dry season sees just a trickle but wet season can be a torrent.TIPS – wet season is not the best time to visit the whole extended beach – lotsa rubbish and storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).- those beach clubs: at least 3 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw the northern-most with at least 1000 people on the sand! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value but too many people for me – I went back to the beer guys.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems mid-range to high end. Dozens of places covering all budgets within a 10 min stroll inland via JL ARJUNA.- JL ARJUNA and others similarly have dozens of restaurants from sub-budget up. Wandering food halwkers on the sand can provide some inexpensive yummy stuff as does the guy doing roasted corn foot of ARJUNA.- no shortage of RETAIL THERAPY on ARJUNA and along JL LEGIAN 800M inland (latter has some of BALI’s better boutiques and furniture/art)- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand.

But for me Double Six has the edge because the beachfront restaurants and bars here are more to my taste, I reviewed B9B (Blue Nine Beach restaurant) elsewhere on here.

People were having to walk amongst it and over it to get to the sea. It was absolutely filthy and stretched right along the beach. I can't believe this is one of the main attractions of the area. I see that other people have left very good reviews so I imagine the beach must be cleaned at certain times of year.

The waves here can get quite big and the under current can also get quite strong. Would suggest that parents keep their children close and in sight at all times. There were some points where I almost fell due to the strong under current. There were peddlers approaching us to purchase things from them, but once you say no they won't bother you so much.

Jul 2015,I recently stayed at a hotel close to the beach and went to the beach each day.The beach had swimming flags which a lot of swimmers swan between.The problem was that lots of surfers also kept moving into the area making it very unsafe for the swimmers due to the surf boards frequently nearly hitting the swimmers.After seeing many near misses I approached the surf life savers they said the current was pulling the surfers along the beach so there is nothing they could do. I pointed out that the flags are there for swimmer safety and the surfers should not be in the area under any circumstances and besides they had all of the rest of the beach to surf. The life savers answer was to remove the swimming flags and put up no swimming signs - not a satisfactory outcome.  For the rest of my stay (9 days) the flags were not put back out. It seems that the surfers have all the rights and to bad for swimmers.I love the Bali beaches its just a pity safety isn't taken a little more seriously but I suppose that's Bali for you.,recently stay hotel close go daythe swimming flag lot swimmer swan betweenthe problem lot surfer keep move area make unsafe swimmer due surf board frequently nearly hit swimmersafter see many near miss approach surf life saver say current pulling surfer along nothing point flag swimmer safety surfer area circumstance besides rest surf life saver answer remove swimming flag put swim sign satisfactory outcome rest stay 9 day flag put back seem surfer right bad swimmersi love bali beach pity safety isnt take little seriously suppose thats bali,"{'neg': 0.099, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.135, 'compound': 0.5575}",0.5575,positive

Jun 2015,"This time we managed to stretch a normal weekend to best possible extent for Bali Trip.We wanted to go to south Bali as our last trip to this part of Asia was more to do with serene mountains,volcanic lakes and monkey forest.South Bali has fabulous beaches starting with Seminyak,Legian and all the way to south Kuta.We chose to stay at Pearl Hotel on Double Six beach road hardly 10 minutes walking distance from all the happening places of South Bali.We took an early flight on Friday afternoon and reached by evening.Anthony,who is the owner of Pearl Hotel had made all arrangements for our pick up from airport.It took just 30 mins to reach the boutique hotel and we dumped our bags in the hotel room and headed for Double Six beach.There were plenty of beach shacks with live music and bean bags on the sand with little colourful umbrellas.'The Sand' has a beautiful set up right on the beach and local band playing.We enjoyed some good nachos and satay along with free flowing drinks and music from Balinese Jennifer Lopez.Night well spent we retired to our hotel.This place is very quiet with a nice pool in the midst of the private rooms with all amenities.After breakfast on Saturday morning we were back on the beach strolling,walking past the huge surfing waves creating a misty environment.There were couches on the beach that one can rent for 10 $ per hour.We had a treat for ourselves on a double couch enjoying breeze on our faces,beautiful view and Amy Tan's 'Saving Fish from drowning'.We had a lazy laid back lunch in Hotel Oberoi with trendy DJ playing and some delicious cocktails I have ever tasted in my life as the relentless waves continued crushing on the beach and created a beautiful rhythm as we sat there sipping our refreshing cocktail and fresh thin crust wooden pizza.The evening was well spent watching the most beautiful sunset ever experienced,hopping beach cafes,floating paper lanterns and watching fire dance all on the beach.We explored Laplancha and The Sand once again this time.Now that we had the entire Sunday to be spent as per our whims we spent it a bit differently pampering ourselves with authentic Balinese massage followed by lunch at the famous MehraPutti on the most happening streets of Semninyak. One can't resist from shopping as you walk past the best shopping boutiques.Watched breathtaking sunset from Hotel Oberoi lounge.one has to make advance booking as this place becomes crowded as the sun sets on the beaches on Legian ,view to cherish for life.Finally we headed to Potato Head for poolside dinner.Both Potato Head and MehraPutti are exquisite dining experiences one must have while at South Bali.We had a morning flight to catch on Monday and thus ended our not so planned but one of the best backpackers tour in Indonesia.Not to forget Pearl had arranged for taxi at the right time in such wee hours even though the reception was closed and their professionalism is much appreciated for making our stay smooth and memorable.",time manage stretch normal weekend best possible extent bali tripwe want go south bali last trip part asia serene mountainsvolcanic lake monkey forestsouth bali fabulous beach start seminyaklegian way south kutawe choose stay pearl hotel double six road hardly 10 minute walk distance happen place south baliwe take early flight friday afternoon reach eveninganthonywho owner pearl hotel make arrangement pick airportit take 30 min reach boutique hotel dump bags hotel room head double six beachthere plenty shack live music bean bag sand little colourful umbrellasthe sand beautiful set right local band playingwe enjoy good nacho satay along free flow drink music balinese jennifer lopeznight well spent retire hotelthis place quiet nice pool midst private room amenitiesafter breakfast saturday morning back strollingwalking past huge surf wave create misty environmentthere couch one rent 10 per hourwe treat double couch enjoy breeze facesbeautiful view amy tan save fish drowningwe lazy lay back lunch hotel oberoi trendy dj play delicious cocktail taste life relentless wave continue crush create beautiful rhythm sit sip refresh cocktail fresh thin crust wooden pizzathe even well spent watch beautiful sunset experiencedhopping cafesfloating paper lanterns watch fire dance beachwe explore laplancha sand timenow entire sunday spent per whim spent bit differently pamper authentic balinese massage follow lunch famous mehraputti happen street semninyak one cant resist shopping walk past best shopping boutiqueswatched breathtaking sunset hotel oberoi loungeone make advance book place becomes crowd sun set beach legian view cherish lifefinally head potato head poolside dinnerboth potato head mehraputti exquisite din experience one must south baliwe morning flight catch monday thus end plan one best backpacker tour indonesianot forget pearl arrange taxi right time wee hour even though reception close professionalism much appreciate make stay smooth memorable,"{'neg': 0.032, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.244, 'compound': 0.9968}",0.9968,positive

He wanted 50000 for two hours which is more than the daily rate.  I told him I was not impressed and he said, ok, go somewhere else.   We did.  My daughters also got their hair braided on the beach.  One daughter paid 100000 and the other paid 150000 ( her hair was very very long and very thick)  this was much cheaper than anywhere else we found and included beads.  You can choose your own colour beads.  There is a constant flow of people offering things.  We mostly didn't mind as the children wanted to buy fairy floss, laser pointers etc.  Pedicures, manicures, all very cheap and reasonable 25000.  Don't expect a first class job but the girls loved the little flowers on their fingers and toes.  We ate dinner there one night, 8 in our group and were stunned at how reasonable it was.  We all ate and drank including beer and some seafood and it cost about $80AUD The live music right there on the sand was great.  So relaxing.

The big waves and white sands are mind blowing.As the waves were big i didn't dive into but my husband went for swim. Unfortunately i was just standing nearby and feeling the waves touching my feets, suddenly a very stong wave came and just made me fall down. I was not able to getup and within a fraction of second it took me away deep.I thought i was dead. My husband came to fetch me but along with me he was also drowning.

I'll never forget this accident. So guys please dont swim in high tides not even stand nearby the waves.Thanks to Almighty for saving both of us.Then all of them encouraged us and half an hour later we decided to climb up.

Feb 2019,"The famous T-Rex beach was just as breathtaking as I had hoped! Absolutely gorgeous spot. Would recommend to anyone visiting Bali. Kelingking beach is located on Nusa Penida, with is a separate island located about 30 minutes by boat from Sanur, Bali. Nusa Penida is still undeveloped, and I would recommend spending a few nights here to really enjoy the island. Another option would be staying on Nusa Lembongan which is only a 5 minute boat ride away from Penida, it has more accommodation options available (in total their are 3 Nusa Islands all located next to each other). Note: It's takes about 30 minutes to get down to the actual beach at Kelingking, but around 1-1.5 hrs to climb back up. The stairs are steep and rocky, not the easiest climb. Their are hand rails most of the way, would not recommend the climb for anyone with mobility or endurance issues. Many people simply come and take pictures from the top without ever climbing down to the water. And that works fine for all fitness/mobility levels. It's a very popular spot, get there early if you can to avoid the crowds. Nusa Penida is amazing, this isn't a spot to rush through in one day. They have tons of great beaches (like crystal bay), great snorkeling, and landmarks like angels billabong, broken beach, etc. The roads to get around the island are in pretty bad shape. Tons of potholes and rubble. It takes a long time to travel around the island because of the bad conditions. If you are renting a scooter be very careful on the roads.

I am not some super dude who is used to trekking , but yes I am in my 30s and not very unfit. So you need to take a call whether your physical fitness is at least at basic level. But if it is then you just have to go down. Make sure you go when there is high tide. We started the trek at around 9:30 a.m. when it was starting to get crowded. It took us around 30 minutes to reach to the beach. First 15 minutes would be too easy and the next 15 minutes you will wonder whether you have done a mistake :-D but just hang in there and continue to go down slowly and slowly. Every 5 minutes take a pause and just look around the surroundings , then you will realise why I am asking you to trek down.

Oct 2018,"It's one of the most popular destinations in west Nusa Penida. It requires good physical condition to go up, down and up again, especially under the tropical sun. It's located quite far, 1,5 hour approximately from Sampalan, the main port to reach Nusa Penida from Sanur. Because of its popularity, to avoid the crowd, I suggest you to be here around 8 am. The earliest fast boat leaves Sanur at 7.30 with 45 minutes travel duration. So people start coming from Bali main island from 10 am approx. It'd be ideal if you spend a night in Nusa Penida and arrive early in Kelingking beach. So you can enjoy the white sandy, secluded beach on your own for some time. You take steepy stairs to go down that only fit for one person. In the busy hours, people make quite long queue waiting to go up or down in turns, one by one. The shower room isn't available on the beach, it's on the cliff. You should pay 5000 IDR to use the shower room/toilet.I wonder how grand the view would be during sunset time.

Feb 2018,"My self and a friend traveled to this spot by motorbike which we rented at the port for around $5 AUD. The roads are in terrible conditions at some points so I wouldn't recommend going this way unless you experienced riding. We reached Kelingking took a couple photos and without hesitation made our way down towards the beach. Let's just say going down was the easy part, The mountain is extremely steep with only some bamboo tied together with some rope to 'stop' you from falling off the edge. It is also extremely hot so take a lot of water, but don't pack too much as the climb back up the mountain can become extremely difficult if you have a lot to carry. Once you do get down to the bottom you can not enter the water, as it is dangerously rough, the waves are huge and crash right on the shore with that much power that even standing meters away you are almost swept off your feet. We were also lucky enough to be able to purchase some water and beers down the bottom as well. We made the silly mistake of drinking a beer before the climb back up which we both regretted as the climb is so hard and with a beer in your belly you do not feel good. The climb back up was exhausting, and we almost passed out from the heat a couple of times because there is absolutely no relief from the sun and we started the climb back up at 12:30 - 1:00 pm. I wouldn't say I am unfit but we both really struggled. We timed the climb up and it took us about 30 mins - although it felt a lot longer!All in all - its an experience like none other!

Dec 2017,"If you have time to spend in Bali, please pay a visit to Nusa Penida. This island is just amazingly stunning. It has multiple beaches with jaw-dropping views, totally worth to visit. One of the great options is Kelingking Beach, or the locals used to call it as Karang Dewa. It is only 45 minutes from the Nusa Penida pier by a motorbike. You can easily rent a motorbike, or hire a cab there. Totally easy.The view was completely amazing, as you can see from many pictures here. However, do not go down to the beach if you are not feeling well. It was noon (around 1 am), when I decided to go down to the beach. Actually, the locals put a warning there to not go down because the track was very steep (yeah, 90-degree cliff) it was just like a wall-climbing without any safety rope, and without any safety guards. Going down is totally at your own risk. Also, consider the time to go down and back up. When I went down it was 1 pm and it was extremely hot and even my sunblock couldn’t prevent me from sunburn. The beach itself was actually very nice, and you can swim and enjoy the view for hours. Don’t forget to bring drinks and foods because there is no food stall down there. But please, I repeat, please bring back your trash up there. If you could, please also bring some other trash there. Unfortunately, there were so many trash on the beach.

Jul 2018,"Kelingking beach is just something you have to see to believe, it is amazing. While we were there we were lucky enough to see the manta rays swimming around at the beach below. A few things to note:The road out to Kelingking is rough, if you decide to do it on a scooter you should be careful as there are a lot of bumps, rocks, soft sand and taxis to contend with. I have heard that the taxi/tour van ride out is quite rough also but if you aren't confident on a scooter then I suggest taking a tour or taxi.This is the number one attraction on Nusa Penida so it gets very busy, if you stay on the island I recommend going early before the boats bring in day tourists.The best view is from the top, but you can hike down to the beach but be warned that it is not an easy one, I recommend wearing sneakers/runners for extra grip and just for feet protection.Areas of the hike down are super steep and quite difficult to negotiate so take your time. Plenty of people do this hike so there are sections where you will have to stop and wait to let people pass you. Be considerate of others and lend them a hand when it's safe to do so. This is a cliffs side you are climbing down which has little shade and sometimes no wind so it gets very hot. Once you make it down to the beach, there is one person who is selling some drinks and snacks but don't expect to have a wide variety and you will pay slightly more then you would normally. It would be wise to take some water and snacks with you. The beach is not necessarily a swim friendly beach, no life guards patrol the beach, the waves can be quite big and come from different directions. If you aren't a strong swimmer I highly advise you don't go in very deep. I swam out into the water and got to swim with some rays which was awesome. It was hard to get in and out safely and I am a strong swimmer.This is one of the most beautiful places I have ever been so if you do decide to do it.

Apr 2019,of Nusa Penida. First you don't have to stand in line (up stairs). People are waiting in front of the tree to make pictures. The is why the line is there.The climb down is a bit sketchy. Don't wear flip flops/thongs or jandals. I have seen people slip/slide/fall and break there foot wear.  They don't have normal stairs. It is just rocks/sand and or mud and it is very steep. It is even steeper when you want to go to the beach. The beach is beautiful. The waves are very strong. Be careful. At the beach you can buy drinks and snack butunfortunately it comes with the plastic mess that we tourists and the locals provide. Bring your stuff back don't trow it along the way (yes you can see bottles/cans etc) lying around. ,nusa penida first dont stand line stairs people wait front tree make picture line therethe climb bit sketchy dont wear flip flopsthongs jandals see people slipslidefall break foot wear dont normal stair rockssand mud steep even steeper want go beautiful wave strong careful buy drink snack butunfortunately come plastic mess tourist local provide bring stuff back dont trow along way yes see bottlescans etc lie around,"{'neg': 0.033, 'neu': 0.797, 'pos': 0.17, 'compound': 0.8519}",0.8519,positive

May 2019,We hadn’t read anything about kelingking so had no idea that there was the hilariously steep climb. The descent was harder partially due to all the instagram photo shoots happening at the top and a flip flop wearing senior citizen who didn’t let people pass him. I would recommend going down backwards in some areas and make use of the railings/ropes where they exist.The beach at the bottom was amazing . The tide is very strong but there is also a life guard pointing out the less dangerous sections. The climb up is easier than doing down.When we got to the top there were like 10x as many people as when we had started . It seemed like hundreds of minivans had all arrived at once full of people doing day trips over from Bali.

Mar 2018,"I had been wanting to visit Nusa Penida after seeing the beautiful pictures everywhere and realizing it was just 30 minutes from Bali where I was going on vacation this past week. The reviews are accurate - this isn't an easy place to get to, and the climb is not easy either - but the view is worth it. I have never seen a place like this in my life and it IS breathtaking. We booked a tour which included a fast boat from Sanur beach to Nusa Penida and then a driver picked us up and drove us there. We could have rented motorbikes or just a taxi, but we weren't sure and were limited on time so we just got a tour guide. The fast boat was about 45 minutes, and once we arrived our tour guide immediately picked us up and started driving up Nusa Penida to the beach, which was about a 45 minute drive through long, winding, and needless to say bumpy roads. Once we arrived the views were incredible and it wasn't too touristy which was great. We decided to start the trek down, and about halfway we stopped to turn back around. To be completely honest, my legs still hurt 3 days later from the hike (and I didn't even go all the way). The hike down is not paved and has rocks and some wood to help guide you, but it's definitely scary and treacherous. I do regret not going all the way down, so if you have time - I would recommend trying it if you are fit and in shape. For me, it was about 90 degrees and I was absolutely exhausted, so I was scared about going all the way down and turned around even though I wish I hadn't.

Blue ocean is the view in front of the cliff, very clear and clean beach. 😍😍😍Actually we can go down for swimming activity or just taking photo in the beach instead of on top of the cliff, but it needs around 1 hour by walking down. Since I'm in a rush of hour to go other places, maybe next time I'll do it.Overall, it takes around 30 min from Nusa Penida port to Kelingking cliff with very wavy and unsmooth road by car like you do off-road. So, I'd suggest that a pregnant woman to do not join this trip due to safety reason. Hopefully in couple of years, the road will be smooth so that everyone can go to this beautiful place. 🙏🏻Besides that, the number of stars hotel are still very limited.

Sep 2019,"Let me start by saying this beach is truely something to behold! Gorgeous in real life however..... Noone prepared me for the trip to the beach and after. I feel I'm doing a public service by providing my experience if nothing else but to prepare other people of what really happens to get to this magnificent place. I feel if I were more prepared for the experience it would not have left such a sour taste in my mouth. Firstly we booked through a company we found on trip advisor and I researched it well, nothing left me thinking they were bad and we were both excited for the trip. We were told it would be a ""private"" trip however when we arrived at the fast ferry port it was clear it wasn't as private as we had imagined. We had to maneuver down a rock wall over 10ft high, sharp, wobbly extremely unsafe! My mum was with me and we were wearing thongs! If you lost your balance you would be in trouble! We get on the packed fast ferry with clearly not enough life jackets for everyone and it was so over full people got given stools to sit in the middle walk way! The ferry ride over (about 20mins) and we all load off to a bunch of people holding signs, we find the gentleman holding ours and he escorts us to another bunch of people where we are loaded onto another boat and handed snorkel equipment... Again NOT private just one in a bunch of other people being hoarded like cattle. We had snorkelling included in our day trip and the chance to swim with Manta Rays! On my bucket list so very excited... However what they don't tell you is your jumping off the boat in OPEN ocean water that is right near a rock face so the current and wave are huge! I am an experienced swimmer however felt overwhelmed with the amount of other people in the water and the conditions... there is no way you are going to see a Manta Ray like that!! What a rip off!!! Next we get taken to another Snorkeling spot, this one more protected and actually quite nice, I used this opportunity to really swim here and enjoy myself. After this you are taken back to the island and meet up with your allocated driver who then takes you to your lunch spot... This is dingy with rats on the rafters and you can select from 2 meals being the cheapest on the menu... This part was private as it was just me and my mum with our driver. Please take travel sickness tablets with you!!! The roads are next level horrible... I've travelled a fair bit and I have never seen roads this bad... I got car sickness in about 15 minutes... And each location is roughly 45 minutes from the other... ALOT of driving!!! We reach Kelingking beach and our driver escorts us, again we only have things on so we are hoping the walk is short. It is but it's treacherous... Bring runners or grippy shoes for your safety!!!Here we see the beach which is lovely however only now does our guide tell us you can walk down if you like it takes over 1 hour and can take double that to walk back up... It is super tempting the view from up here is gorgeous and the adventurer in me wants so badly to try however we are not prepared for this... We have no water, not appropriate shoes and no swimmers or towel!! A bloody heads up for this would have been nice...  a missed opportunity for us! Don't get me wrong the driver was trying to be super helpful and it wasn't his fault the company had not filled us in however by now my patience is wearing thin. Guys are up in trees trying to get you to take pictures and then stinging tourists for the shots, like come on!!! We are now told another hour to next spot! I'm not sure I can handle another hour on these god awful roads while being carsick... But I jump in and suck it up. The next spot is Angel Billabong and Broken Beach they are essentially walking distance from each other .... Again other shoes would have been nice as thongs SO NOT appropriate. We took some shots and headed back.. at this point I have requested to go back to the port I'm done and ready to go home. We wait at the port for over an hour for the next ferry and we notice there are more and more people every minute... Seems too many... As suspected they have absolutely jam packed the ferry to the brim, it takes 3 smaller boat rides to the ferry to get all the passengers on board. This little boat is on the verge of sinking due to the weight! Finally we get on the fast ferry and we get stuck at the very back of the ferry STANDING by the 4 big propellers, getting soaked by the giant waves the whole way back... We feared for our safety on the way back! To top of off once we get off we Wade through thigh high water and again scale the dangerous rock wall to get to the top! All in all I just wanted people to know what they are getting themselves into BEFORE they go so unlike us they can properly prepare and hopefully have a better experience than us. It seems noones safety is considered on this trip and in this day and age it's disappointing that so many people's life's at put at risk to make some money.",let start say truely something behold gorgeous real life noone prepare trip feel im public service provide experience nothing prepare people really happen magnificent place feel prepared experience leave sour taste mouth firstly book company find trip advisor research well nothing leave think bad excite trip tell private trip arrive fast ferry port clear wasnt private imagine maneuver rock wall 10ft high sharp wobbly extremely unsafe mum wear thong lose balance trouble pack fast ferry clearly enough life jacket everyone full people get give stool sit middle walk way ferry ride 20mins load bunch people hold sign find gentleman hold escort u another bunch people load onto another boat hand snorkel equipment private one bunch people hoard cattle snorkelling include day trip chance swim manta ray bucket list excite dont tell jump boat open ocean water right near rock face current wave huge experience swimmer felt overwhelm amount people water condition way go see manta ray rip next take another snorkel spot one protect actually quite nice use opportunity really swim enjoy take back island meet allocate driver take lunch spot dingy rat rafter select 2 meal cheapest menu part private mum driver please take travel sickness tablet roads next level horrible ive travel fair bit never see road bad get car sickness 15 minute location roughly 45 minute alot drive reach kelingking driver escort u thing hop walk short treacherous bring runner grippy shoe safetyhere see lovely now guide tell u walk take 1 hour take double walk back super tempt view gorgeous adventurer want badly try prepared water appropriate shoe swimmer towel bloody head nice miss opportunity u dont wrong driver try super helpful wasnt fault company fill u now patience wear thin guy tree try take picture sting tourist shot come now tell another hour next spot im sure handle another hour god awful road carsick jump suck next spot angel billabong break essentially walk distance shoe nice thong appropriate take shot head back point request go back port im do ready go home wait port hour next ferry notice people every minute seem many suspect absolutely jam pack ferry brim take 3 small boat ride ferry passenger board little boat verge sink due weight finally fast ferry stick back ferry stand 4 big propeller get soak giant wave whole way back fear safety way back top wade thigh high water scale dangerous rock wall top want people know get go unlike u properly prepare hopefully good experience u seem noones safety consider trip day age disappoint many people lifes put risk make money,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.697, 'pos': 0.226, 'compound': 0.9969}",0.9969,positive

Getting a photo taken at the spot without the fence here though looks a bit dangerous and is a bit of a joke as you had to fall in line as if going to the toilet. The path down the ravine to the beach was closed when we went there and did not look at all safe but a fair few were willing to risk it for instagram. HahaThe place was a bit of a drive but relatively easy to get to with a map and a few directions from locals. Going back was confusing on a motorbike.We got to sample the local mie goreng as well which was surpringly offered at a very affordable price compared to the rest of the tourist spots and Bali.

I wouldn't do it in flip flops, but I found my running sandals worked fine -- sneakers would've prevented me from feeling the rock. But if you're scared of heights, have knee problems, or aren't physically fit, probably skip the climb down. At the bottom of the climb is the most gorgeous beach I have ever seen. Perfect white sand flecked with pieces of coral, a massive cavern on one side of the beach, and the T-Rex cliff on the other. The waves are big, strong, shore breakers and there is a fairly hefty rip current. If you are not an experienced ocean swimmer I'd suggest staying out of the water; I saw multiple people get thrown onto the coral-flecked shore by a wave, and it didn't look pleasant.

Oct 2018,"One of the best and most terrifying experiences of my life... My boyfriend and I tackled the hike down to the beach at about 9am. Not too busy at this time but still people around. The hike down was hectic and so dangerous and the way up was exhausting. I saw people suffering heat stroke and dehydration which could have been fatal if they were not careful. The beach is totally worth it and one of the most exceptional beaches I’ve seen but there are a few things to know before you go: 1. Bring so much water- it’s a life saver and if you have enough to offer to people in need it can be a literal life saver 2. Wear shoes... we wore jandles (flip flops) on the way down and I ended up doing it barefoot, but the way back up the ground was too hot and I would have preferred real sneakers. 3. Do not attempt if you are unfit and think you will not make the climb back up. 4. The shore dump is not something to be taken lightly... it is amazing and refreshing but be so careful, I saw a guy dislocate his shoulder being dumped back onto the beach and luckily my boyfriend (knows first aid and shoulder distress) and a tourist who had just finished med school were there to help. A lot of people will not be as lucky. Enjoy every minute but be safe and look after people around you.

Jun 2018,"WoW....WoW... was the simultaneous outcry of my family members when we first encountered the view from the top. We started from Yasa Homestay at Toya Pakeh, Penida area after lunch to start our sight seeing of Nusa  Penida island. This island is very sparsely populated and long time ago, it was used to send prisoners from mainland. We first drove to Kelingking Beach. Our driver for the day, Mr. Kadek, arrived at about 3pm and we drove to Kelingking cliff to see the beach. It took about 1hour to reach the place - the road was generally good except a patch of 5-6km where the road condition was pretty bad. You have to walk about 3-4 minutes from Parking area to reach the view point. Most tourists view the Kelingking beach from the cliff top. The water at the beach was emerald blue and it is very difficult to go down as the access path is rocky (no hand support when you descend and in most of the places in the path steps are broken). In fact, Yasa Homestay owner, Mr. Teja and hist two sisters with other three friends went to the beach the very next day and brought us pictures and videos of the path. It took them more than 2 hours to reach and similar time to come up. It was really scary. If you have children, it should be avoided. We took snaps from top. We can see the clear beach using a 150-600 lens. Only few foreign tourists were seen close to beach. Most tourist try to avoid going down the beach because of its difficult to walk and risk of a fall is very high. Couple of month's ago, one tourist had died (we were informed by our driver). But the view was magnificent. We understood from local people that Nusa Penida has relatively more Muslim populations compared to mainland Bali. But all speak same Balinese language as we see in Kerala (people from all communities speak Malayalam). Houses or villages are sparsely located in Nusa Penida. For miles you will not find any house or shop. We spend about one hour here.

I hike quite often back home in Western Canada, so I felt pretty confident doing it until I slipped and fell and cut up my elbows.

So can get some very pretty pictures from there because the second half down is soooo much worse and extremely steep with very tight spacing which makes it very tricky when ur going down and ppl are coming up. Some ppl were doing the hike bare feet to get better grip which might be an idea worth trying?!?Once you get down to the beach, it is pure paradise. Can’t swim in it but the massive waves are beautiful to see and there is a tiny stand down there serving drinks which is cool. Can’t believe they go up/down that hike every day with merchandise. Hike back up was fine for me because I have strong upper body and it requires lots of pulling yourself up holding onto support branches that are places along hike. My wife who has weak upper body found it very challenging going back up and was sore for about 3 days where she couldn’t move her arms without pain.

Feb 2019,"Even though I went to Bali for scuba diving, I had to spend one day visiting the west part of Nusa Penida which I believe is more famous and appealing than the east part.My first stop was the Kelingking beach which I absolutely loved. Many people complained about the crowd, but if you visit it before 11AM like I did, you won't see a lot of people until you go back to the top.The view from the top is breathtaking, and you can fully admire the T-Rex shape that everyone talks about. However, there is more to it. If you take your courage in both hands, and make it all the way down to the beach, you will not regret it. Though be warned than it's rather tricky to reach to the beach, and I strongly recommend you to wear a good pair of shoes over sandals, but you will want to wear the latter once you reach the beach. A woman twisted her ankle on the way down, and I have absolutely no idea how she made it back to the top so please be careful if you wish to go to the beach.Once you are at the beach, simply enjoy. The waves crushing on the beach make it a very relaxing place, and the view is also quite amazing. That said, if you wish to swim, you might be disappointed as the currents are quite strong, and only experienced swimmers should enjoy.Again, if you want to fully enjoy this place, go early in the day. There were six or seven people on the beach when I went in the morning, but close to a hundred when I went back up early in the afternoon.Enjoy :)",even though go bali scuba dive spend one day visit west part nusa penida believe famous appeal east partmy first stop kelingking absolutely love many people complain crowd visit 11am wont see lot people go back topthe view top breathtaking fully admire trex shape everyone talk take courage hand make way will regret though warned rather tricky reach strongly recommend wear good pair shoe sandal will want wear latter reach woman twist ankle way absolutely idea make back top please careful wish go beachonce simply enjoy wave crush make relaxing place view quite amaze say wish swim might disappoint current quite strong experienced swimmer enjoyagain want fully enjoy place go early day six seven people go morning close hundred go back early afternoonenjoy,"{'neg': 0.092, 'neu': 0.554, 'pos': 0.354, 'compound': 0.9906}",0.9906,positive

Our pants/shorts got wet by the waves but it turned out to be the highlight of the session.  The 6 pm scheduled preview was fun but overwhelming because we had to choose from the 354 shots taken.  Our preliminary number was 81 photos.  We were going to review the 81 photos to reduce it some more but then the male staff interrupted and offered us a deal....the first deal was not good enough and we refused....he sweetened the deal a bit more and we went off tip toeing our way to the restaurant for a special dinner.

The water was warm and crystal clear, the sand well kept and plenty of time has been spent making the place look great.WI was told by a few people that the rubbish situation is seasonal as particular currents and water flows bring the rubbish into the area but that its soon flushed out.

However the beach is more dangerous along near the Novotel beach club - there is a strong current there at times. There are some life guards but I would not rely on them. Be careful. The surf break out on the reef seems to work ok at times but I am not a surfer. The water is fairly clean but there is some floating rubbish. The hotels that front the beach keep the sand clean. The beach is very shallow at low tide right out to the reef. No good for swimming or anything at low tide.

However, the currents are quite strong and you need to be careful with weak swimmers or children. There are also far far fewer interruptions from sellers than some of the others like Kuta/Seminyak.The first time we visited we paid 200,000 for two sunbeds with an umbrella in a hotel complexes private area. As a result we had no interruptions and were able to go to the hotel for lunch and a swim in the pool if we wanted. To be honest, I think we could have maybe bargained them down but we didn't bother.The second time we paid 50,000 for two in a different area of Nusa Dua and this was on the public beach.

My husband enquired for jetski and he was quoted USD$55 for 30 minutes - not sure if this is the normal rate but it seemed quite pricey so we did not go ahead. - We saw a couple renting a kayak and they went kayaking but there seemed to be no regulations whatsoever.

Feb 2016,"This beach is quite nice stretch of white sand, that is relatively clean and maintained, especially if you walk around the bigger and luxurious hotels. A promenade lines the shore , passing hotels of mainly 4-5* rating, allowing you to see the gardens, pools and the architecture of each hotel. This promenade, especially heading south of hotel Bali Tropic offers nice walks, good jogs or bike rides. Heading north of the hotel, after about 1,5km, you will pass through few dirty and unkept areas, which ruins the walk. There are a few downsides of this otherwise lovely beach-Firstly it is the constant noise of water scooters and fast boats, that spoil the tranquility of this place. We visited in February '16 and the hotels and beaches were quite empty, which suited us. However I can imagine this place getting very busy and even noisier in the peak periods and turning this lovely area into sea of bodies fighting for the beach and sun lounger. The second downside is the difference in tide of these shallow waters . In high tide, the swimming areas (you can only swim in small sections marked by the buoys) is ok but never too deep, which makes is ideal for small children. Also the currents are very weak, making the beach quite safe for non swimmers. During the low tide, in many places you can barely swim- the water level is up to the waistline. Also in low tide you often swim through the algae, which is not pleasant at all. The hotels are trying to clean the beach of plastic, algae and other debris, but sometimes their efforts are not enough. In general, it is a lovely stretch of beach worth visiting and perhaps staying in one of many luxury hotels.

Due to the location of the hotel that would have been impractical so we had breakfast at the hotel and it was very good. Although the setting is very similar to other resorts we have stayed in around the world there are a number of touches that make it distinctively Balinese. A down side to the resort is that it is in an area full of gated resorts and nothing around that you can wander out and look at so you feel that you’re tied to the resort unless you want a trip out by taxi . There is a free shuttle to a shopping centre called Bali Collection but it feels like walking round a retail outlet at home. We found it good for buying any toiletries or water that you may need. All in all the resort served a purpose for us. We booked it for relaxation at the end of a trip.

Jul 2019,"The only unenjoyable thing about doing Water Sports in Nusa Dua is negotiating the prices with the operators. There are dozens of companies lined up along the beach, one after the other, all after your business. They vast majority of them will charge you as much as they can and make the whole process very confusing. The 1st thing you need to do is research your prices. We found some great prices on the Wira Water website and we used them as a negotiating tool. The prices are less than half of what operators will try and charge you. The 2nd thing you need to know is that if you let your taxi or shuttle driver enter the car park of any business, they will get a 5% cut of whatever you spend. Tell them to park outside and send someone off to talk to the various operators until they find the right one. There were 9 people in our group. We negotiated the internet prices with a further 10% off the prices found on the internet and no additional credit card fees (usually an extra 4%). The whole group had a 15 minute jet ski, tandem parasail, banana boat and four people did the flying fish. In total Cost was 2,500,000 IDR or around $250AUD. Very reasonable! Also the operators were happy because we didn’t book it through the internet agency and therefore cut out an extra middle man. Last time we were in Bali we all wanted to go parasailing and booked through an agency in Seminyak. When we arrived at Nusa Dua they told us that it was too windy and they weren’t doing parasailing.

When assessing the Nusa Dua beach I am Referring to the public beach at the entry points where most people seem to stay in this area (and are supposed to stay?).  I am rating the public beach sections. To your left as you come out is the more northerly section to the left, strictly speaking this is Nusa Dua beach.  It is a sand and rock beach bounded by massive, and I mean massive, walls of sandbags to protect the coast.  There is another section to your right that is more attractive and the start of the longer southerly section, which has other named beach sections.  At this end it’s ok but the ubiquitous plastic seems to gravitate to this end, so walk further south.  If you look at some maps the whole beach for the next 4km is labelled Nusa Dua beach, however a succession of hotels adopt each section of beach. So although you are not discouraged or checked you get the feeling most locals don’t penetrate to the far end of the beach which took about a 45 minutes stroll. At the end there is a long curving jetty looking up to the Monastery which is not accessible from the beach.  It gets cleaner and here are less people the further you walk up the beach. Overall a nice beach but I wouldn’t travel from Seminak again to go there, although I would say that it looks cleaner water. I also think it’s much cleaner than the beaches going up further north on the Nusa Dua peninsula which gets nearer and nearer to the port traffic and all the pollutants that go with ports.

You need to get up early if you want sun-beds that are in the shade, as people reserve them with hotel beach towels. In common with many tropical beaches, the water near the beach is a shallow lagoon, formed by the reef which is a bit further out. There is a line of buoys which separate the swimming area from the area used by small boats (some of them fast-moving), so you're not supposed to swim out to the reef. You can have a good swim only around high tide, as it's too shallow at other times. There are some beach-hawkers but they are polite and not persistent and their merchandise seems pretty good.",review specific front nusa dua hotel spa nice picturesque sandy quite lot shade available due palm tree need early want sunbeds shade people reserve hotel towel common many tropical beach water near shallow lagoon form reef bit line buoy separate swim area area use small boat fastmoving youre suppose swim reef good swim around high tide shallow time beachhawkers polite persistent merchandise seem pretty good,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.79, 'pos': 0.21, 'compound': 0.9287}",0.9287,positive

Jun 2015,"This is, by TA's forums consensus, one of the cleanest beach in Bali. Which pretty much says it all -  Bali's beaches are now for the most part detritus-filled.

At the end of the road, there is beach area for us to relax whilst waiting for our wives to finish their massage. Walking along the beach, I realised that despite all the beach chairs and facilities by the hotels, the beach is actually quite dirty. Seen load of rubbish floating along the waves onto the beach. There was a bar somewhere nearby and we had our Bintang Beer at 35,000 ruppiah per glass. Can't complain on the hotel pricing. The next day, we were taken to another side of Nusa Dua where we wanted to do the Sea Walker but on arrival was told that per pax cost us USD108. I understood from the internet it cost around USD55 so there was no way we were going for it. Instead, snorkeling cost only USD25 so in order to satisfy the boys, we agreed to take up snorkeling. We were taken to a boat which took us out further to sea. On the way, it was a long sad sight to see. Rubbish on the beach and floating on the sea. Dead sea corals underneath! Not so clear waters. Is this the Great Bali Beach we came for? When we jumped out of the boat for snorkeling, the waves were incredibly strong even for an adult, and the tide keep taking us away from the boat. I had to swim afloat just to keep an eye on the boys from straying away. The snorkeling activity was for an hour but after 20 mins, we all decided we had enough and jumped onto the boat. Surprisingly, there is no ladder and not easy climbing up by stepping on the motor engine. Along the way back, plenty of sea activity... jet skies, banana boat etc. How long will this beach last until the sea becomes undesirable one day?

Oct 2014,"We are a French family currently living in Singapore. It was the third time to Bali, so we wanted to stay at a clean and quiet beach, with no vendor bothering us, and where kids could swim in the sea. Purpose was just to relax.We found all this in Nusa Dua, although the area is secluded and the beach could be anywhere on the globe, as there is no specific Balinese taste when you are on this beach. But we knew it and just wanted to experience this for 5 days, not far from home.The sand was clean and blond as well, very nice. We could swim in the lagoon where the water was clear and pristine. There is a promenade along the beach, connecting all the hotels on this beach, most of them of high-end to luxury. The architectural design of most hotels fits well with the nature (wood/local style). The hotel buildings are also usually set back from the beach. So the natural seafront landscapte is relatively more preserved than on other sanur or kuta beaches.Of note, in South Bali, we find most beaches crowed, dirty and full of vendors that are very anoying sometimes. Some may say the vendors are part of the local experience. Agree but when it disturbs you, it is not pleasant at all.

Jun 2019,"….This 5km section of the continuous KUTA-CANGGU beach strip rates AVERAGE by Bali mainland standards but BELOW AVERAGE by world standards….You don’t come to Bali for great beaches...correction, you may come to Bali to sit on the beach in tropical conditions when it’s  freezing at home, sipping a cut price cocktail yada…..but the beach will not be whelming…. not on the mainland at least.I’m a beach blogger with over 3 million hits – get back to BALI annually and always make a point of cycling/walking SEMINYAK – stayed inland there a few years back. I’ve visited thousands of beaches over 40 years and would not rate BALI MAINLAND’s best in my top 500. Offshore LEMBONGAN may just scrape in. IN CONTRAST gorgeous and spectacular ARTUH BEACH** (offshore NUSA PENIDA) would make my top 10. Maybe even top 3.But hey, if you seldom see a beach, you may think SEMINYAK the ants pants. As FERRIS BUELLER’S bookie never said: “Sure beats a sand-pit in south SPRINGFIELD”.See. what we have here is a long strip of sand where it’s easy to find a fairly deserted section - or to sit with a crowd on rather swish sun-loubge/umbrella combinations if that’s your jam. These more crowded parts are outside the bigger resorts (all sized high-end places back the beach along here) + where roads from inland (more accommodation) access the sand.There’s a gradual change heading north. South end near the big DOUBLE SIX** resort has sand similar to KUTA-LEGIAN: kinda tan-grey (rather than the gorgeous white stuff when I first visited in ‘75). Heading north it darkens somewhat – although never reaching the light black of CANGGU BCH immediately north. Most areas are quite wide but it does narrow in sections.Activity changes too – the first 400m is a continuation of the crowded KUTA-LEGIAN scene. 3 or 4 beach bars with cushions/small tables on the sand are a real scene around sunset. Moving north it becomes quieter with gaps between crowded areas. The far north can be very uncrowded.TIPS – those beach clubs: maybe 4 starting at D6 RESORT. 2019’s visit saw one with at least 1000 people on the sand!!!! Most seemed Indonesian (it was the IDUL FITRI holiday period). Indos in holiday mode are good value.- all beachfront accommodation these days seems high end. Dozens of all budget places within a 10 min stroll inland.- football fans will usually find several games on more open sections of sand. Outsiders welcome.- wet season is not the best time to visit – lotsa rubbish and dirty storm run-off in the ocean, onshore blustery waves can create dangerous swimming conditions and periodic storm-drains and creeks gushing across the sand make lateral progress difficult. However many still holiday here (hotels/airlines offer great low season packages) – although SANUR the other side of the island has much nicer (better sheltered) conditions. BTW you can still get plenty of sunshine in wet season (usually).SUM UP – an okay beach, just don’t expect WHITEHAVEN.",5km section continuous kutacanggu strip rate average bali mainland standard average world standardsyou dont come bali great beachescorrection may come bali sit tropical condition freeze home sipping cut price cocktail yadabut will whelm mainland leastim blogger 3 million hit back bali annually always make point cyclingwalking seminyak stay inland year back ive visit thousand beach 40 year rate bali mainlands best top 500 offshore lembongan may scrape contrast gorgeous spectacular artuh offshore nusa penida make top 10 maybe even top 3but hey seldom see may think seminyak ant pant ferris buellers bookie never say sure beat sandpit south springfieldsee long strip sand easy find fairly desert section sit crowd rather swish sunloubgeumbrella combination thats jam crowd part outside big resort size highend place back along road inland accommodation access sandtheres gradual change head north south end near big double six resort sand similar kutalegian kinda tangrey rather gorgeous white stuff first visit 75 head north darkens somewhat although never reach light black canggu bch immediately north area quite wide narrow sectionsactivity change first 400m continuation crowd kutalegian scene 3 4 bar cushionssmall table sand real scene around sunset move north becomes quieter gap crowd area far north uncrowdedtips club maybe 4 start d6 resort 2019s visit saw one least 1000 people sand seem indonesian idul fitri holiday period indos holiday mode good value beachfront accommodation day seem high end dozen budget place within 10 min stroll inland football fan will usually find several game open section sand outsider welcome wet season best time visit lotsa rubbish dirty storm runoff ocean onshore blustery wave create dangerous swim condition periodic stormdrains creeks gush across sand make lateral progress difficult many still holiday hotelsairlines offer great low season package although sanur side island much nicer well shelter condition btw still plenty sunshine wet season usuallysum okay dont expect whitehaven,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.768, 'pos': 0.172, 'compound': 0.9878}",0.9878,positive

We saw three dead turtles whilst travelling in Indonesia, and were informed that the most common cause of a turtles premature death in those waters in due to ingesting plastic. Seminyak beach is covered in tiny pieces of plastic and polystyrene which ends up in marine life's stomachs. Which is wonderful for the local people who rely on fish for protein. We spoke to many fishermen who are outraged by this horrendous rubbish problem in the ocean. Playing in the waves you feel rubbish brushing past you and it's just not pleasant. One day we didn't even go in the sea as there was so much rubbish! There needs to be recycling facilities that are readily available and free for hotels in Seminyak and all of Bali.

Coming from Australia, where we have such clean and beautiful beaches, I am left to compare my beaches to that standard. Seminyak beach was overcrowded with beach umbrellas and lounges for tourists. I realise this is normal for this time of year (January). But what disappointed me the most was the rubbish. There were tonnes of man-made rubbish scattered along the beach with no attempt by local authorities to clean it up. With the little attempt made by local shopkeepers to clean up, it was stored on the foreshore for the tide to take away. I can only imagine what Kuta beach would have been like.It was certainly a different experience.

Mar 2016,"Husband and I took a stroll on this beach today. The water was warm enough to be considered bath water. The waves were incredible. If I were surfer I would have been stoked, dude. Totally stoked. We also stopped off at Ku De Ta for a slushy (we both got watermelon, but I had to add simple syrup to mine because it was toooo sour). We watched two senior citizens battle the current, only up to their knees in the water. I seriously feared for their lives as I watched them almost get sucked out with the current.

There were people everywhere and it just like it was so normal to them. It would be nice to maybe have more bins on the beach and make the locals and tourists aware of how bad it is to litter on the beach. Not only for the looks of the beach but also for the sea life. At breakfast the next day in our resort, I asked the manager if it was ever cleaned. He told me that the beach was cleaned every night. WOW- I was surprised. During that morning, we went for another walk and there was minimal rubbish. (Sadly, it was there again every night, but that did not stop the people coming in. ) The waves 🌊 looked amazing and many people were enjoying themselves surfing, swimming etc. We decided to just swim in the pool instead. The sand in front of The Royal Beach Resort was very grey, not the sand I expected. Nor, was it any good for making Sand Castles. Still a nice view though. 😊This photo is more towards Seminyak where the sand got a better. This was also during the day.

The most attractive of the Kuta-Legian-Seminyak strip of beaches.Although other posts have mentioned rubbish etc, it was clean when we were there (several visits, from 21-27 Jan 2016), although it rained every day. We were at the southern end - apparently the stream in the north near the temple can bring out rubbish after rain.Negotiate for umbrella lounges on the beach - we paid IDR50,000 for a 2-bed lounge, which is probably expensive, but, hey, for $5 all day, who cares? The same chap who sells you the lounge can also supply you with well-priced cold drinks (coke, beer, coconuts etc).Note for foreign tourists - you can't sit on the lounges for free 'just for 10 minutes', as we saw several tourists try to do, including a couple of female Australians who wanted to change their toddler's nappy (!). The lounges are rented, it's how those guys make their living - if they let everyone sit on the lounges 'just for 10 minutes', they wouldn't make a rupiah.There are some sellers trawling the beach, but they're not too pushy, and perhaps not as numerous as in Kuta and Legian.You can just sit on your towels on the beach for free, but you might get burnt that way.There are numerous beach shacks south of Jl. Camplung Tanduk, they are cheap and good for burgers, juices and beer.Surf is good for boogie boarding and body surfing. Gets a bit rough and erratic, with some cross-currents, at the end of low tide, be careful near the breakers at this time.If you're lucky enough to be from a place with outstanding beaches (e.g. Australia, South Africa, Hawaii, California),  you might think this beach is not much.

Jul 2019,"I have been coming to Bali for a number of years. I always enjoy the ocean and the beaches, and Seminyak is one of my favourites. The beach is long, and the sea looks amazing. However, the issue of plastic pollution on the beach is really starting to get bad. Twice a day we would walk 3 or 4 km down the beach and we would pick up at least 100 plastic straws, empty water bottles, individual mint wrappers, bottle tops etc etc. I implore the local authorities to make more of an effort to keep these beaches clean and plastic free, otherwise tourism will start to decline.

Mar 2015,"Seminyak Beach is a beautiful beach to look at. Unfortunately, any beach in Bali would be pretty polluted. As someone who grew up in Indonesia, I wish we'd paid more attention to keeping our beautiful country clean, but it was just never a priority and hopefully that's changing soon and our environment would be getting a little more TLC. Seminyak, Legian and other beaches along this coastline are great for surfing, body/boogie boarding, and watching the sunset. They are not good for swimming or snorkeling as the waves are too big. If you walk along the stretches of private beaches (exclusive to resort guests), they are likely to be clean, but go into the water and you'll likely spot some garbage (plastic bags, paper towel, piece of stick, anything you can think of) floating around. As far as the area itself, Seminyak is a hot spot, second busiest to Kuta with an older, slightly more sophisticated crowd. There are cute little shops, both modern and traditional restaurants, and bars with happy hour deals and live entertainment just about any night of the week. On the weekends (especially Saturday night), the place is a zoo. If you're looking for a little peace and quiet, you probably won't find it in Seminyak unless it's off-season and/or you're staying at a resort with a private beach. If you are looking to swim or do other water sports, Tanjung Benoa, Nusa Dua and beaches on the other coast would be much better.

Apr 2014,"This probably isn't a well warranted review, based on experience, but here goes!  We walked to Seminyak Beach from our villa in the Jalan Kunti 1 area (near to Bali Deli), the first night we arrived to Bali.  We've been here a month - give or take - and I have not returned.  Early evening, and it's about a 20 minute, winding walk through the streets of Grosinyak to get there.  We arrive to find, not so much a beach, but more akin to a newly started landfill.  Plastic, garbage, washed up debris of all sorts, littering the beach and floating in the water.  Not exactly a Kodak moment!  And yet - swimmers, surfers and sun worshipers galore!  I guess it's that ""when in Rome"" mentality?  (I'd rather just go to Rome!)  Oh wait!  I lie!  We did walk the beach a second time during a pouring rain storm, which was a million times better as there were only a handful of folks around, and clean-up crews were hard at work which was great to see, but limited to the beach-fronts of the fancy hotels.

Apr 2017,"And you get all sorts of life on Seminyak Beach. It all depends on what you want from a beach as to whether or not it is a good place to go.The problem here is that for every good point, there is an opposite and vice versa. Firstly this is a huge beach. At low tide very wide and it is accessed by a few gaps in the rows of restaurants, cafes and bars which line the coast usually abutting the access roads . You will pay to park, even a motorbike nearby but then it will be relatively safe. The alternative is that you will get free parking in an isolated area and have you bike pinched or complain that there are no facilities.This is an excellent beach for running especially by the water and if you go fast enough you wont be bothered by hawkers. However if you stay still for five minutes they will be all over you. Especially if you show any interest in the sunglasses, watch or Ken Holm wok that they are selling. This is truly an international problem now but they have to earn a living and they generally move on if politely addressed. The problem is that there are so many of them there is always another one to follow. Alternatively, you may just want your hair braiding, sir, or your nails varnishing whilst sitting on a beach. To be honest, you can get pretty much anything you want on Seminyak Beach except probably any peace.The water is warm but a lot of sand suspension as it is shallow. It can also be windy and because of its undisturbed length,windy and disorientating. Look out for the flags for safe swimming. A truly high point is to watch the sunset especially with a cold beer at one of the bars or walking along the sand with your partner. If my memory serves me correctly though.

What I saw instead was a beach full of trash, stray dogs running around, some brown water in the beach and some red flags that's telling you not to go into the water. Trash. That's what I felt as I was walking around in the water and on the beach. There are lot of TRASH. I couldn't stand in the water for a minute without some kind of trash touching my feet. Wrappers, Cloths, or whatever. Trash. Now I come from Los Angeles where there are a lot of people that go in the water and has commercial businesses all around. Even LA beaches felt it was cleaner and more sanitary than here. I couldn't believe all the amount of trash floating in the water and debris on the beach. I thought this was supposed to be a paradise, instead it felt like where all the trash ended up. Granted some of them could be from Bali and some of them could be from elsewhere just washing up here. Regardless, it felt dirty just standing in the water with the damn trash touching my feet every 10 seconds or so!I saw some brown water and thought it was weird that the water was so brown. Not all parts but some parts. I asked around why the water was brown and no one knew. Also there were red flags all around and when I asked around, people were saying because the wind was strong and that you could get sucked out to the ocean due to fast & strong current. Also there are apparently whirlpools that will suck you in. That's a scary thought. I've also seen some stray dogs running around. One time I saw a pack of 5 dogs all playing with each other on the beach. Sure that sounds cute except when you come to realize that some of these dogs could have rabies, probably had no owners, and that they were playing in the beach where people were. I'm sure the dogs don't think about where to pee and poop. I'm from USA where there are regulations against dogs on the beach due to them crapping and peeing which contaminates the water. In Seminyak I've seen a lot of stray dogs around which didn't help the feeling I got about the hygiene and cleanliness of the water. The water was very warm. That was one plus about the beach. With the clouds far away and the sandy beach all around, this was a plus. There weren't that many pluses given I've also been to beaches in Thailand which were freakin Awesome.",go seminyak first time expect paradise saw instead full trash stray dog run around brown water red flag thats tell go water trash thats felt walk around water lot trash couldnt stand water minute without kind trash touch foot wrapper cloths whatever trash now come los angeles lot people go water commercial business around even la beach felt clean sanitary couldnt believe amount trash float water debris think suppose paradise instead felt trash end grant bali elsewhere wash regardless felt dirty standing water damn trash touch foot every 10 second soi saw brown water think weird water brown part part ask around water brown one knew red flag around ask around people say wind strong sucked ocean due fast strong current apparently whirlpool will suck thats scary think ive see stray dog run around one time saw pack 5 dog play sure sound cute except come realize dog rabies probably owner play people im sure dog dont think pee poop im usa regulation dog due crap pee contaminates water seminyak ive see lot stray dog around didnt help feeling get hygiene cleanliness water water warm one plus cloud far away sandy around plus werent many plus give ive beach thailand freakin awesome,"{'neg': 0.105, 'neu': 0.736, 'pos': 0.16, 'compound': 0.9348}",0.9348,positive

Jul 2016,"I've been to Seminyak many times now and love it. The beach is fantastic, I love going to La Plancha and the other beach bars to get a mid afternoon drink in between splashing in the surf and relaxing on one of the many recliners. As the sun nears the moment of spectacular sunsets I transition to one of the colourful beanbag chairs to enjoy the view. Then, I stay at a nearby hotel so I can quickly shower, change and get to one of Seminyak's many gorgeous delicious restaurants. It's easy enough to rent a motorcycle or hire a driver to go up and around the island on longer days to view the many temples, rice terraces and other more Balinese favourite spots. I will warn that our fellow Australian neighbours tend to get a bit crazy and exhibit at times an appalling lack of respect for the local people and other tourists. But, hey, there are many Aussies that are super charming and delightful... I love you guys. Just reign in the trashy types a bit better... frankly, it's embarrassing. We all want to have a good time in this friendly, gorgeous place... it doesn't require falling on the ground or vomiting in the bushes to make that possible. Our Indonesian hosts would appreciate your thoughtfulness as well.Do keep in mind that Seminyak is in the trio of townships along western Bali that are most commercial and frequented by tourists. You can minimise the negative impacts of this by keeping your daily travel to a minimum, locating your accommodations close to where you want to spend most of your time and planning all day tours for yourself that start early in the morning before traffic gets really ramped up.",ive seminyak many time now love fantastic love go la plancha bar mid afternoon drink splash surf relax one many recliner sun nears moment spectacular sunset transition one colourful beanbag chair enjoy view stay nearby hotel quickly shower change one seminyaks many gorgeous delicious restaurant easy enough rent motorcycle hire driver go around island long day view many temple rice terrace balinese favourite spot will warn fellow australian neighbour tend bit crazy exhibit time appal lack respect local people tourist hey many aussie super charm delightful love guy reign trashy type bit well frankly embarrass want good time friendly gorgeous place doesnt require fall ground vomit bush make possible indonesian host appreciate thoughtfulness welldo keep mind seminyak trio township along western bali commercial frequent tourist minimise negative impact keep daily travel minimum locate accommodation close want spend time planning day tour start early morning traffic get really ramp,"{'neg': 0.06, 'neu': 0.608, 'pos': 0.333, 'compound': 0.9951}",0.9951,positive

Feb 2017,"Seminyak beach is beautiful, stretching for kilometers. Great for walking, surfing (body, bogey board and just surfboard), and taking amazing photographs of Bali Beach Life and, of course, beautiful sunsets. It is also lined with some amazing places to eat and sleep (see my other reviews for Seminyak) which are perfect for a drink, a meal or just  enjoying the almost nightly beautiful sunsets. This would be a five star beach except for two, or three caveats. One is that alot of people have dogs in Bali and bring them on the beach. Which means if you like to walk barefoot on the beach, like I do, then you need to pay extra attention that you don't step into a fresh dog droppings. Two is that at various points along the beach there are effluents from various parts of town. This is raw sewage. I either walk out in the surf to cross them or just turn around and walk the other way. Needless to say, you don't want to be swimming directly offshore, or down current unless you've had all your shots!;) Thirdly is a new hazard which I only noticed on this last trip, which is broken shards of glass from beer bottles. The ones I spotted at low tide were in the shallow water and constantly being covered and uncovered by the trailing surf. I made a mental note to myself to pack my white water sandals next time I come. It's really a shame that such a beautiful natural spot as Seminyak is being polluted in this way. But while the above hazards do detract from the water and beach activities they do not affect the absolutely amazing sunsets.

Mar 2014,"As lovely as the weather was in Bali last week, the one thing I just could not stay silent about is how dirty the beach was. There were rubbish that formed a tide line here on Seminyak, and also along Kuta. It was such an eye sore. And worse, true to its name, there were oil slicks coming in with the waves. Seminyak in bahasa means ""one oil"". I guess Bali really didnt want to disappoint. If you want the beach, go elsewhere. Heard Sanur is far better...or even Nusa Dua....or anywhere else, but...But if you dont want the beach, then why even go to Bali? I just had the misfortune of not doing enough research about the island. Probably deluded by the many glorified romantic tales - blame eat pray love for that! But if you seek to just chill and unwind, then, this island is ideal. And this part of Kuta (contrary to popular belief, Seminyak, Legian and Kuta is in reality ONE area) is the quieter portion. Food wise? For Asians, it's not really value for money at all. Drinks are rather pricey too. Shopping for the ladies? Sure...Bangkok's cheaper. Heck, even KL is far cheaper. Nightlife? In Seminyak? They only have 2 options, apart from dinner. One is the high end restaurants-turn-club-after-dinner, the other...well, if you dont swing the other way, and do not like diva shows, then hail a cab and hit Jalan Legian, Kuta instead.But the one thing I enjoyed Seminyak for was the hospitality at the hotel and restaurants I went to.

Nov 2016,"There are so many great beaches in Bali..give this one a miss if you can. I'm not sure if it was just the time of year that we were there but there were pretty significant waves breaking near the shore that make this beach difficult to actually swim at. If you enjoy body surfing (or actual surfing) and aren't scared of large waves you might like it here. Also the beach had lovely sun loungers set up all along it that you have to pay to use. You could set up on the sand but it's kind of awkward setting up between the loungers and the sand is really hot. The loungers are expensive and while laying on them you are constantly harassed by vendors selling knock off sunglasses, cheap ""jewelry"", and sarongs. The vendors were non stop and really took away from the enjoyment. Bali has tons of quiet white sand beaches with minimal break, I think it's worth it to put in the effort to find one near you instead of Seminyak Beach :)",many great beach baligive one miss im sure time year pretty significant wave break near shore make difficult actually swim enjoy body surf actual surfing arent scar large wave might lovely sun lounger set along pay use set sand kind awkward set lounger sand really hot lounger expensive lay constantly harass vendor sell knock sunglass cheap jewelry sarong vendor non stop really take away enjoyment bali ton quiet white sand beach minimal break think worth put effort find one near instead seminyak,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.626, 'pos': 0.257, 'compound': 0.9521}",0.9521,positive

Apr 2017,I didn't like Semiyak beach at all. Went there once. In fact Semiyak was not what I was expecting. It's really busy with lots of traffic taxi drivers constantly hooting. I just didn't feel relaxed. It felt like we where in a hot noisy city full of designer shops and to find a nice beach you had to go to a beach club with a minimum spend. We left after a few days even though we had a hotel. We also had a lot of trouble getting cash out. Make sure when using cash machine you press checking account as it has 3 options and you press the wrong one and you don't get any money. A lot of the machines kept running out of money. Everyone from all over the world had trouble getting cash. Always get a blue bird taxi as they have to use the meter and they are much cheaper. You can download the app before you come called my bluebird taxi. I went all over Bali and I found the people very friendly everywhere. And if you learn thank you and a bit of Balinese they love it. Oh if you like wine ( like me) bring it from duty free as it's expensive everywhere in Bali. Semiyak is not the place for cheap shopping either. It's all expensive cloths shops and we found prices cheaper in Kuta. ,didnt semiyak go fact semiyak expect really busy lot traffic taxi driver constantly hoot didnt feel relax felt hot noisy city full designer shop find nice go club minimum spend leave day even though hotel lot trouble get cash make sure use cash machine press check account 3 option press wrong one dont money lot machine keep run money everyone world trouble get cash always blue bird taxi use meter much cheap download app come call bluebird taxi go bali find people friendly everywhere learn thank bit balinese love oh wine bring duty free expensive everywhere bali semiyak place cheap shopping either expensive cloth shop found price cheap kuta,"{'neg': 0.108, 'neu': 0.749, 'pos': 0.143, 'compound': 0.7575}",0.7575,positive

The sand and beach are so clean and smooth, it was such a nice alternative to all the other rocky beaches surrounding and the Gili Islands. The rocky beaches are great for photos and are beautiful, but sometimes you just want to swim or lounge and not worry about cutting your feet or getting knocked into rocks. Seminyak is perfect for that. We spent days on this beach enjoying every moment of it. Lots of baby crabs at night that sometimes pop out during the day, but it was cute and fun.
